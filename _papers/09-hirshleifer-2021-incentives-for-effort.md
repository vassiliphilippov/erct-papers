abstract: >-
  This randomized experiment implemented with school children in India
  directly tests an input incentive designed to increase effort on learning
  activities against both an output incentive that rewards test performance
  and a control. Students in the input incentive treatment perform .58σ better
  than those in the control, and .34σ better than students in the output
  incentive treatment. Thus, the input incentive is approximately twice as
  cost-effective as the output incentive. The input incentive increases the
  intensive margin of student effort on the learning activity, and it is
  particularly effective for students that are present-biased as measured
  at baseline.

      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "Classrooms were randomized into treatments using a partial rotation
         design over two units." (Section 3.4) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper explicitly describes randomization at the classroom level.
      By assigning entire classes to input‑incentive, output‑incentive, or
      control, the study prevents any within‑class contamination between
      treatment groups. This fully satisfies the ERCT ‘Class‑level RCT’
      requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is met because the study randomized
      treatments at the classroom level, ensuring proper separation of
      groups.

    explanation: >
      Randomization occurred at the classroom level, preventing contamination
      across students in the same class.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Each learning module covers a specific topic such as two‑digit by
         two‑digit multiplication, and the tests at the end of unit draw only on
         the material covered in the core modules in that unit." (Section 3.2) 

      2) "During the study, students took two tests at the end of each unit;
         the first is the output activity and the second measures the main
         outcome of the study." (Section 3.2) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The outcome measures rely on custom‑designed KA Lite tests aligned
      to the modules, not on any standardized, widely recognized examination.
      Thus, the assessments cannot be considered standardized exam‑based.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because the study uses custom
      KA Lite tests rather than a standardized exam.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Two units of KA Lite content were included in the study, with each
         unit taking six weeks on average." (Section 3.2) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Each instructional unit lasted approximately six weeks, and outcomes
      were measured immediately thereafter. This period is shorter than a
      full academic term (typically 3–4 months), so the study does not meet
      the term‑long follow‑up requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is not met because the measurement occurs
      after six weeks, less than one full academic term.

      term.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "All classrooms in the study, including those in the control and in
         both the treatments, were expected to complete the same activities
         on the KA Lite platform." (Section 3.2) 

      2) "The 17 classrooms initially assigned to the control remained in the
         control for both units." (Section 3.4) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The control group is clearly documented: its composition (17 classrooms),
      its activities (completion of the same modules and tests without
      incentives), and its role across both units. This satisfies the requirement
      for a well‑documented control.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the control condition is fully
      described and its baseline and activities are documented.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Classrooms were randomized into treatments using a partial rotation
         design over two units." (Section 3.4) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomization occurred at the classroom level within schools, not at
      the level of entire schools. Therefore, the study does not satisfy the
      stronger school‑level RCT criterion.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met because randomization did not
      occur at the school level.

      "Classrooms were randomized into treatments using a partial rotation

         India directly tests an input incentive designed to increase effort on
         learning activities against both an output incentive that rewards test
         performance and a control." (Abstract) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The author and her team designed, implemented, and analyzed the
      intervention without mention of an independent third‑party evaluator.
      All key activities—curriculum development, data collection, and
      analysis—were conducted by the study team, introducing potential bias.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because the intervention and
      evaluation were conducted by the same research team.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The total study duration (~12 weeks) is far shorter than a full academic
      year. No year‑long tracking is reported.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because the follow‑up spans only
      ~12 weeks, not a full academic year.

      Detailed Analysis:

      No additional time, budget, or materials were provided to the input
      or output incentive groups beyond what was given to the control.
      All groups had identical educational inputs, so resource balance is
      maintained.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is met because all groups received the
      same core inputs without extra resources introduced by the treatments.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper does not reference any subsequent independent studies
      replicating its methods or findings. No external replication is reported.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study measures outcomes only in mathematics. No assessments of
      other core subjects (e.g., reading, science) are conducted, so
      cross‑subject balance is not evaluated.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because only mathematics is
      assessed.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study does not track students beyond the two instructional units,
      and no graduation data are collected.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because there is no graduation
      tracking.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Registration in the AEA registry indicates the study protocol was
      publicly recorded before data collection. This fulfills the
      pre‑registration requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion P is met because the study was pre‑registered
      in the AEA registry (AEARCTR-0000643).
