  Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) programs are school-based preventive
  interventions that aim to improve children’s social-emotional skills
  and behaviors. Although meta-analytic research has shown that SEL
  programs implemented in early childhood can improve academic and
  behavioral outcomes in the short-term, there is limited work examining
  program effects on children’s math and language skills in the
  longer-term. Moreover, few studies have considered variation in impacts
  by children’s pre-intervention academic skills. Using an experimental
  design, the current study leveraged administrative data available
  through school records (N=353) to examine the impacts of one SEL
  program—INSIGHTS into Children’s Temperament—implemented in early
  elementary school on math and language standardized test scores from
  third through sixth grade. Findings revealed positive average treatment
  effects on English/Language Arts (ELA) test scores in third and fourth
  grade, but not in fifth and sixth grade. Students who had higher
  academic skills at study enrollment showed lasting impacts on ELA
  scores in fourth, fifth, and sixth grade. There were no treatment
  impacts on math skills, and no variation in effects on math achievement
  by baseline skills. Implications are discussed.

      1) "Between 2008 and 2012, 22 elementary schools from three New York
      City school districts were randomly assigned to participate in the
      INSIGHTS intervention or to an attention-control condition." (p. 7)
      
      2) "A random numbers table was used to assign schools to receive the
      INSIGHTS intervention or the attention-control condition." (p. 9)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT standard for criterion C requires that the study be a
      Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) conducted at the class level, with
      randomization occurring among classes rather than just students within
      classes. However, it also notes that if a stronger school-level RCT
      criterion is met, the weaker class-level RCT criterion is considered met.
      In this paper, the authors describe randomizing entire schools to either
      the INSIGHTS intervention or an attention-control condition, as evident
      from the quote: "22 elementary schools ... were randomly assigned."
      This indicates a school-level randomization, which is a more robust
      design than class-level randomization because it reduces the risk of
      contamination across classes within the same school. The use of a
      random numbers table further supports the randomization process. Since
      school-level randomization exceeds the minimum requirement of
      class-level randomization, this satisfies criterion C.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion C is met because the study randomized entire
      schools, which is stronger than class-level randomization.

      1) "we accessed students’ scores on the state English Language Arts
      (ELA) and math standardized test scores through administrative
      records." (p. 12)
      
      2) "We used z-scoring to standardize ELA and math scores within grade,
      subject, and testing year." (p. 12)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      Criterion E requires the use of standardized exam-based assessments that
      are widely recognized and not specially designed for the study. The
      paper states that it used "state English Language Arts (ELA) and math
      standardized test scores" obtained from administrative records. These
      state tests are administered across New York City schools and are not
      custom-made for this specific study, aligning with the requirement for
      objective and comparable results. The z-scoring process described
      ensures consistency across grades and years, further supporting the use
      of a standardized measure. There is no indication that these tests were
      developed by the researchers, confirming their status as widely
      recognized assessments.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion E is met because the study used state
      standardized tests for assessment.

      1) "Students participated in intervention activities across two
      years—kindergarten (study year 1) and first grade (study year 2)."
      (p. 9)
      
      2) "The INSIGHTS intervention was implemented for 10 weeks in the
      winter of the kindergarten year." (p. 10)
      
      3) "The intervention was implemented across 10 weeks in the late fall
      and early winter of the first grade year." (p. 10)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      Criterion T mandates that the intervention lasts at least one full
      academic term, typically 3-4 months. The paper details that the INSIGHTS
      intervention was delivered over two separate 10-week periods: one in
      kindergarten and another in first grade. Each 10-week period (roughly
      2.5 months) is close to a full term, and the standard specifies that if a
      stronger year-long criterion is met, this weaker term-duration criterion
      is also satisfied. Here, the intervention spanned two academic years,
      with two distinct 10-week implementations, exceeding the minimum
      requirement of one term. The total duration and structure ensure
      meaningful impact measurement over a significant period.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion T is met because the intervention was
      implemented over two 10-week periods, each equivalent to one academic
      term.

      2) "Table 2. Baseline descriptive statistics for INSIGHTS and
      attention-control groups." (p. 15)
      
      3) "We compared characteristics of study students and schools randomly
      assigned to the INSIGHTS and attention-control conditions to assess
      baseline equivalence." (p. 17)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      Criterion D requires detailed documentation of the control group,
      including demographics, baseline performance, and any treatments
      received. The paper describes the control group as participating in a
      10-week supplemental reading program, distinct from the INSIGHTS
      intervention, and provides baseline characteristics in Table 2. This
      table includes demographics (e.g., gender, race, free lunch eligibility)
      and baseline academic skills, allowing for comparison with the
      intervention group. The explicit comparison for baseline equivalence
      further confirms thorough documentation. This level of detail meets the
      standard’s requirement for a well-documented control group.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the control group is
      well-documented with baseline characteristics and details of the
      attention-control condition.

      Criterion S requires an RCT conducted at the school level, with
      randomization among schools. The paper explicitly states that 22
      elementary schools were randomly assigned using a random numbers
      table, fulfilling this requirement. This school-level randomization is
      consistent across the study’s methodology, ensuring real-world
      relevance as specified in the standard.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion S is met because the study randomized entire
      schools.

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      Criterion A requires measurement of impact on all main subjects taught
      in the school, using standardized exams. The study assessed only ELA
      and math scores, with no mention of other core subjects like science or
      social studies. While criterion E is met (standardized exams), the
      limited scope to two subjects does not fulfill the requirement to assess
      all main subjects, thus failing this criterion.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because the study only measured
      outcomes in ELA and math, not all main subjects.

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      Criterion Y requires the intervention to last at least one full academic
      year. The intervention spanned two years, with 10 weeks each in
      kindergarten and first grade, totaling approximately 20 weeks across
      two academic years. This exceeds the one-year requirement, satisfying
      the criterion.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion Y is met because the intervention was
      implemented over two academic years.

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      Criterion B requires the control group to balance time and resources
      with the intervention group. The INSIGHTS group received extensive
      in-school sessions (10 weeks per year for two years, involving
      teachers, parents, and students), while the control group received a
      10-week after-school reading program with two 2-hour workshops for
      teachers and parents. The intervention’s resource intensity (time,
      facilitators, materials) significantly exceeds the control’s, which was
      less structured and resource-light. This imbalance does not isolate the
      intervention’s specific effect, failing the criterion.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion B is not met because the control group did
      not receive balanced resources or time compared to the intervention
      group.
