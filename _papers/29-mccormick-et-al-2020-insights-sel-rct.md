abstract: >-
  Social‑Emotional Learning (SEL) programs are school‑based preventive
  interventions that aim to improve children’s social‑emotional skills and
  behaviors. Although meta‑analytic research has shown that SEL programs
  implemented in early childhood can improve academic and behavioral
  outcomes in the short‑term, there is limited work examining program
  effects on children’s math and language skills in the longer‑term. Moreover,
  few studies have considered variation in impacts by children’s pre‑intervention
  academic skills. Using an experimental design, the current study leveraged
  administrative data available through school records (N = 353) to examine
  the impacts of one SEL program—INSIGHTS into Children’s Temperament—
  implemented in early elementary school on math and language
  standardized test scores from third through sixth grade. Findings revealed
  positive average treatment effects on English/Language Arts (ELA) test scores
  in third and fourth grade, but not in fifth and sixth grade. Students who had
  higher academic skills at study enrollment showed lasting impacts on ELA
  scores in fourth, fifth, and sixth grade. There were no treatment impacts on
  math skills, and no variation in effects on math achievement by baseline
  skills. Implications are discussed.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Between 2008 and 2012, 22 elementary schools … were randomly assigned
      to participate in the INSIGHTS intervention or to an attention‑control
      condition.” (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The unit of randomization was entire schools, not individual students or
      classes within schools. Under the ERCT Standard, school‑level random
      assignment satisfies or exceeds the requirement for class‑level RCTs.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is met because randomization occurred at the
      school level, ensuring whole‑class (and whole‑school) assignment. 
    quote: >
      “22 elementary schools … were randomly assigned to participate in the
      INSIGHTS intervention or to an attention‑control condition.” (p. 9)
    explanation: >
      The study randomized entire schools to treatment or control, satisfying the
      requirement for class‑level RCT. 
    met: true

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “As noted above, we accessed students’ scores on the state English
      Language Arts (ELA) and math standardized test scores through
      administrative records.” (Methods)

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The outcomes were measured with state‑administered standardized exams
      in ELA and math, not custom instruments developed by the authors.
      Therefore, the assessment tool is a recognized, externally validated exam.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is met because the study used official state
      standardized tests. 
    quote: >
      “We accessed students’ scores on the state English Language Arts (ELA)
      and math standardized test scores through administrative records.”
    explanation: >
      The study employed official state standardized exams for ELA and math,
      meeting the exam‑based assessment requirement. 
    met: true

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Children began participating in the study when they were in
      kindergarten (Study Year 1) and continued … through the end of
      their first grade year (Study Year 2).” (Methods)

      2) Follow‑up test scores were collected in third through sixth grade,
      spanning multiple academic years.

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      Outcomes were measured at least one full academic term after the
      intervention began (indeed, several years later). This far exceeds the
      minimum requirement of term‑long follow‑up.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is met because outcomes were assessed at
      least a full term—and in fact multiple years—after the intervention started. 
    quote: >
      “Children began participating … in kindergarten … and continued … through
      the end of their first grade year.” 
    explanation: >
      Outcomes were measured in subsequent grades, well after at least one
      full academic term had elapsed, fulfilling the term‑duration requirement. 
    met: true

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Schools not assigned to INSIGHTS participated in a 10‑week,
      supplemental reading program after school hours … teachers and
      parents attended two 2‑h workshops …” (Methods)

      2) Table 2 and Table 3 describe attrition and baseline equivalence for
      both INSIGHTS and control groups. (Results)

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The paper provides demographic and baseline test‑score information for
      the attention‑control group, and clearly documents that they received
      a specified alternate activity rather than the SEL program. This level of
      detail meets the requirement for a well‑documented control group.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the control condition’s
      composition, baseline data, and “attention‑control” activities are fully
      described. 
    quote: >
      “Schools not assigned to INSIGHTS participated in a 10‑week,
      supplemental reading program after school hours …” 
    explanation: >
      The control group’s makeup, baseline statistics, and alternate program
      are clearly documented, satisfying the requirement for a documented
      control group.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “… 22 elementary schools … were randomly assigned …” (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      School‑level randomization clearly meets the standard for S (School‑level
      RCT), which requires entire schools to be assigned as units.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is met because the randomization occurred at
      the school level. 
    quote: >
      “22 elementary schools … were randomly assigned to participate …” 
    explanation: >
      Randomization at the school level fulfills the school‑level RCT criterion. 
    met: true

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) The authors and their institutions both designed and evaluated
      the INSIGHTS program. No external evaluation team is mentioned.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The same research team who developed INSIGHTS conducted data
      collection and analysis. There is no indication of an independent
      third‑party evaluator.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because the evaluation was
      conducted by the intervention developers themselves, not an independent
      group. 
    quote: null
    explanation: >
      The study was implemented and analyzed by the same team that
      developed the program, so there is no independent evaluation group. 
    met: false

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) Follow‑up test scores were collected in third through sixth grade,
      covering multiple years post‑intervention.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Although the core intervention spanned 10 weeks per year, the study
      tracked academic outcomes for several years—well beyond one full
      academic year.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is met because the study follows students
      through an entire school year and beyond. 
    quote: null
    explanation: >
      Students’ outcomes were measured over multiple grades, covering at
      least a full academic year of follow‑up. 
    met: true

  b:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) INSIGHTS schools received extensive teacher, parent, and
      classroom sessions over 10 weeks per year.
      
      2) Attention‑control schools received only two 2‑h workshops for
      teachers and parents, with no comparable classroom sessions.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The control condition did not match the treatment group in terms of
      session frequency or duration. This imbalance in instructional input
      means that differences in outcomes could be partly due to resource
      differences, violating the balanced‑control requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is not met because the control group did
      not receive equivalent instructional time or resources. 
    quote: null
    explanation: >
      The control group’s activities were far less intensive than INSIGHTS,
      so resource allocation was not balanced. 
    met: false

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) No mention is made of any replication of the INSIGHTS trial by an
      independent research team in this paper.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The original study has not been reproduced by a separate team in a
      peer‑reviewed context, nor does this article reference any such work.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because there is no evidence of
      independent replication. 
    quote: null
    explanation: >
      There is no reference to an external, independent replication of the
      INSIGHTS trial.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) Outcomes were limited to ELA and math standardized test scores.
      
      Detailed Analysis:

      The study did not assess academic performance in other subjects
      (e.g., science, social studies). Thus it fails the “All‑subject Exams”
      requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because only two subjects were
      tested, and no justification for exclusion of others is provided. 
    quote: null
    explanation: >
      The authors measured only ELA and math; other core subjects were not
      assessed. 
    met: false

  g:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) Final test scores were collected in sixth grade, with no tracking to
      graduation from elementary or middle school.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Although outcomes were measured several years post‑intervention, there
      was no follow‑up through the end of the relevant school level (e.g.,
      graduation from elementary or middle school).

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because the study does not
      follow participants through to a formal graduation milestone. 
    quote: null
    explanation: >
      No data are reported beyond sixth grade (middle school entry), so
      graduation tracking is incomplete. 
    met: false

  p:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) There is no mention of pre‑registration or registry identifiers anywhere
      in the article.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study does not cite any pre‑registered protocol or registry ID
      before data collection, failing the pre‑registration requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met because no pre‑registration is
      documented. 
    quote: null
    explanation: >
      No pre‑registered protocol or registry reference is provided in the paper. 
    met: false
