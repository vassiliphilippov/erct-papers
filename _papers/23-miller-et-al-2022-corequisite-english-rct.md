abstract: >-
  This study provides experimental evidence on the impact of corequisite
  remediation for students underprepared in reading and writing. We examine the
  short-term impacts of three corequisite models implemented at five large urban
  community colleges in Texas. Results indicate that corequisite remediation
  increased the probability of passing a first college‑level English course within
  one year by 24 percentage points and within two years by 18 percentage points,
  with positive effects across underrepresented subgroups. We document modest
  gains in credit accumulation but no effect on persistence.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We recruited and consented 1,276 newly enrolling students over three
      semesters ... Students were randomly assigned to either corequisite
      remediation ... or the traditional semester-long integrated reading and
      writing DE course." (p. 4)

      2) "At two of the five colleges ... students were pre-randomized ... at the
      other three study colleges ... students ... were randomized through the
      survey platform after consent. Students who opted to participate were
      randomized to corequisite remediation or to the highest level standalone
      IRW DE course." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard’s Class-level RCT criterion requires that entire classrooms
      or schools be randomized to intervention or control. Here, randomization
      occurred at the individual student level within advising sessions. There is
      no indication that whole class sections or institutions, rather than
      individual students, served as the unit of assignment.

      Final Summary: Criterion C is not met because the study randomized individual
      students rather than entire classes or schools.
    explanation: >-
      Randomization was conducted at the individual student level rather than by
      class or school, failing the class-level RCT requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To assess course passing, grades were recorded on a standard A–F basis in
      THECB data, and we defined passing as receiving a grade of C or better."
      (p. 15)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study’s outcome measures rely on institutional course grades and credit
      accumulation rather than on a recognized standardized examination instrument.
      There is no mention of employing a statewide or national standardized test.

      Final Summary: Criterion E is not met because no standardized exam-based
      assessment was used.
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured via course grades and credits, not through a
      recognized standardized examination.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Instructional time for the college course was common across colleges
      (48 instructional hours), and the course ran for 16 weeks for all colleges
      except College E. College E used eight-week terms ..." (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention lasted a full academic semester (16 weeks) at most colleges,
      satisfying the minimum term-long duration requirement of the ERCT Standard.

      Final Summary: Criterion T is met because the corequisite courses spanned a
      full 16-week semester.
    explanation: >-
      The intervention courses ran for a full 16-week semester, meeting the term
      duration requirement.
    quote: >-
      "Instructional time for the college course ... ran for 16 weeks for all

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We recruited and consented 1,276 newly enrolling students ... Students
      were randomly assigned ... We refer to those randomized to corequisite
      remediation as the 'treatment group' and those randomized to the stand-alone
      IRW course as the 'control group'." (p. 4)

      2) "Differences in baseline covariates by treatment status remain small in
      magnitude, and none of the differences are statistically different from zero."
      (p. 18)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper clearly documents the composition and size of the control group,
      including consent rates, enrollment percentages, and covariate balance.
      Baseline characteristics for control students are presented in tabular detail.

      Final Summary: Criterion D is met because the control group’s characteristics
      and baseline performance are thoroughly documented.
    explanation: >-
      The control group’s composition, consent rates, and baseline covariates are
      documented in tables and text, satisfying documentation requirements.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We conducted a student-level RCT. All first-time-in-college students
      scoring within ... were recruited ... during orientation or initial advising
      sessions." (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard’s School-level RCT criterion requires entire schools to be
      randomized. This study randomized individual students within each of five
      colleges, not whole institutions.

      Final Summary: Criterion S is not met because randomization was at the
      student rather than school level.
    explanation: >-
      The study randomized individual students rather than entire schools, failing
      the school-level RCT requirement.
    quote: >-
      "We conducted a student-level RCT ... Students ... were randomized to
      corequisite remediation or to control."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "All of the participating colleges volunteered to participate in the
      study and had established their own approaches to corequisite remediation
      prior to participation." (page 84)

      2) "The research reported here was supported, in whole or in part, by the
      Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through
      grants [R305H170085 and R305N170003] to the American Institutes for
      Research and [R305H150094] to the RAND Corporation." (page 98)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires the study to be conducted by a third-party
      evaluator, not the intervention designers. The corequisite models were
      designed by the participating colleges, while the RCT was conducted by
      external researchers from various institutions (e.g., RAND Corporation,
      University of Texas at Dallas). Funding from the Institute of Education
      Sciences further supports the independence of the evaluation team from
      the intervention’s design.

      Final Summary: Criterion I is met because the researchers were
      independent from the model designers.
    explanation: >-
      The study was conducted by researchers independent from the designers of
      the corequisite models, satisfying the ERCT requirement for Criterion I.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We recruited ... over three semesters (fall 2016, spring 2017, fall 2017).
      We examined outcomes measured over one- and two-year intervals." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Although outcomes were tracked for up to two years, the corequisite
      intervention itself lasted only one semester per cohort. The ERCT Year-long
      Duration criterion requires at least a year-long intervention, not follow-up
      measurement.

      Final Summary: Criterion Y is not met because the intervention spanned only a
      single semester rather than a full academic year.
    explanation: >-
      The corequisite support lasted one semester; the Year-long intervention
      requirement is not satisfied.

      "The course ran for 16 weeks ... cohorts spanning fall 2016 to fall 2017."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "As the central and required key component of corequisite remediation, all
      study colleges required students to enroll in both English Composition I and an
      attached IRW DE support course." (pp. 9–10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The extra DE support is an integral part of the treatment condition—the very
      focus of the intervention. Under ERCT Standard rules, when additional
      instructional resources are the treatment variable, business-as-usual control is
      permissible.

      Final Summary: Criterion B is met because the additional DE support is the
      core treatment variable.
    explanation: >-
      The DE support hours are integral to the corequisite intervention, so the
      control’s business-as-usual condition is appropriate.

      (No mention of an independent replication of this specific RCT by another team
      in the paper.)

      1) "This paper details findings from the first randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) study of corequisite remediation in reading and writing." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper does not report any external replication studies of its corequisite
      findings. Although related quasi-experimental work exists, no separate RCT
      replication is described.

      Final Summary: Criterion R is not met because the study has not been
      independently replicated.
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication of this RCT is reported in the paper.

      1) "We examined the impacts on passing English Composition I, other college-level
      courses, total accumulation of college-level credits, and persistence." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study measures only English and reading/writing outcomes. It does not
      assess broad academic achievement across multiple core subjects as required
      for the All-Exams criterion.

      Final Summary: Criterion A is not met because outcomes were limited to
      English and reading/writing only.
    explanation: >-
      Only reading and writing outcomes were measured, failing the all-subject
      exam requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Considering the enormous societal benefit of a college education,
      corequisites are most likely the preferred policy from a societal point
      of view even when they are more expensive to implement and given that
      they only have a small impact on the likelihood of completing college."
      (Miller et al., 2023, p. 1)

      2) "We examined the impacts of corequisite remediation on the following
      outcomes measured over one- and two-year intervals..." (page 78)

      3) "To assess one- and two-year persistence, we examined the effect of
      corequisite remediation on enrollment one and three semesters after..."
      (page 90)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking students until graduation to evaluate
      long-term impacts. The original study measured outcomes only over one
      and two years, with no immediate data on graduation or degree
      completion. However, a subsequent analysis of the same student cohorts
      (Miller et al., 2023) extended the follow-up through college completion.
      This follow-up found that corequisite remediation had only a small
      positive effect on the likelihood of students completing their college
      program, indicating that students were indeed tracked until graduation.

      Final Summary: Criterion G is now met because the research team followed
      the students through graduation in a follow-up study.
    explanation: >-
      A follow-up study by the same research team tracked the original student
      cohort through graduation, satisfying the ERCT requirement for Criterion
      G.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper does not mention a pre-registered protocol or registry entry
      before data collection.

      Final Summary: Criterion P is not met because no pre-registration is reported.

      There is no indication that the study protocol was pre-registered before
      data collection.
