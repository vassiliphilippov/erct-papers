abstract: >-
  This is the first study to provide experimental evidence of the impact of 
  corequisite remediation for students underprepared in reading and writing. We 
  examine the short-term impacts of three different approaches to corequisite 
  remediation that were implemented at five large urban community colleges in Texas, 
  and we explore whether corequisites have differential impacts on students with 
  different characteristics. Results from three first-time-in-college cohorts 
  indicate that corequisite remediation increased the probability of completing a 
  first college-level English course within one year by 24 percentage points and 
  within two years by 18 percentage points. The impacts were positive for all three 
  of the corequisite models examined and for traditionally underrepresented groups, 
  including Hispanic students, first-generation college students, and students whose 
  first language is not English. We saw modest positive impacts on the accumulation 
  of college credits but no effect on persistence in college.

    explanation: >
      The study used student-level randomization rather than randomizing entire 
      classes.

      "To investigate the causal impact of corequisite remediation on student 
      outcomes, we conducted a student-level RCT." (page 87)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students were randomly assigned to either corequisite remediation — a 
      college-level English Composition course paired with a concurrent reading 
      and writing DE support—or the traditional semester-long integrated reading 
      and writing DE course that was required prior to entering college-level 
      English." (page 78)

      2) "To investigate the causal impact of corequisite remediation on student 
      outcomes, we conducted a student-level RCT." (page 87)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper explicitly states that randomization was conducted at the student 
      level within colleges, not at the class level, as required by criterion C. The 
      ERCT Standard mandates that entire classes be randomly assigned to treatment 
      or control to prevent cross-group contamination. Quotes such as "We conducted 
      a student-level RCT" (page 87) and the description of individual student 
      assignments confirm this approach. While students were placed into specific 
      course sections post-randomization, the sections themselves were not randomly 
      assigned, indicating that the study does not meet the class-level 
      randomization requirement.

      Therefore, criterion C is not met because the randomization was at the student 
      level rather than the class level.

    explanation: >
      The study used course grades and administrative records for outcomes, not 
      standardized exam-based assessments.
    quote: >
      "To assess student achievement in postsecondary education, we utilized 
      statewide administrative data held by THECB. These administrative data contain 
      information on course enrollment and grades for each student at all higher 
      education institutions in Texas." (page 90)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We examined the impacts of corequisite remediation on the following 
      outcomes measured over one- and two-year intervals: passing a first 
      college-level English Composition course; passing other college-level 
      courses, including a second college-level English Composition course and a 
      college-level reading course; total accumulation of college-level credits; 
      and persistence." (page 78)

      2) "To assess student achievement in postsecondary education, we utilized 
      statewide administrative data held by THECB. These administrative data 
      contain information on course enrollment and grades for each student at all 
      higher education institutions in Texas." (page 90)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study measures outcomes using course completion and grades from 
      administrative records, not standardized exams. The ERCT Standard requires 
      widely recognized, standardized exam-based assessments, not custom or 
      institution-specific measures like course grades. Although the Texas Success 
      Initiative Assessment (TSIA) is mentioned for placement purposes, it is not used 
      to measure study outcomes. Thus, the reliance on administrative data rather than 
      standardized exams means criterion E is not met.

      Criterion E is not satisfied because the study did not use standardized 
      exam-based assessments for outcome measurement.

      The intervention involved a semester-long corequisite remediation model, which 
      constitutes at least one full academic term.
    quote: >
      "Instructional time for the college course was common across colleges (48 
      instructional hours), and the course ran for 16 weeks for all colleges except 
      College E. College E used eight-week terms for its corequisite model..." (page 85)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Under corequisite remediation, students skip the traditional DE course(s) and 
      move immediately into a foundational college-level course, while also being 
      required to enroll in concurrent DE support in that same semester." (page 79)

      2) "Instructional time for the college course was common across colleges (48 
      instructional hours), and the course ran for 16 weeks for all colleges except 
      College E. College E used eight-week terms for its corequisite model..." (page 85)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires the intervention to last at least one full academic 
      term (approximately 3-4 months). The corequisite remediation model is a 
      semester-long intervention, with most colleges delivering it over 16 weeks, 
      which aligns with a standard semester. Even at College E, where it was an 
      eight-week term, this is considered a full term within that institution’s 
      context. The intervention’s duration meets the criterion’s requirement, as it 
      spans a full academic term.

      Criterion T is met because the intervention lasted at least one full academic term.

      The control group is well-documented with detailed demographic information and 
      baseline characteristics, as shown in Table 5.
    quote: >
      "Table 5 presents findings on the balance of predetermined covariates across 
      treatment and control students." (page 91)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students were randomly assigned to either corequisite remediation—a 
      college-level English Composition course paired with a concurrent reading 
      and writing DE support—or the traditional semester-long integrated reading 
      and writing DE course that was required prior to entering college-level 
      English." (page 78)

      2) "Table 5 presents findings on the balance of predetermined covariates across 
      treatment and control students." (page 91)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires the control group to be well-documented with 
      demographic information, baseline performance, and treatment conditions. Table 
      5 (page 91) provides detailed covariates such as age, race, gender, and 
      educational background for both treatment and control groups, ensuring 
      comparability. The control group’s condition—enrollment in the traditional DE 
      course—is clearly described, and no additional treatments were provided during 
      the study. This thorough documentation satisfies criterion D.

      Criterion D is met because the control group is comprehensively documented.
  s:

    explanation: >
      The study used student-level randomization within colleges, not school-level 
      randomization.

      2) "To investigate the causal impact of corequisite remediation on student 
      outcomes, we conducted a student-level RCT." (page 87)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the school level, meaning entire 
      educational institutions are assigned to treatment or control. The paper 
      consistently describes a student-level RCT within five Texas community 
      colleges, with no indication that entire colleges were randomized. The focus on 
      individual student assignments within institutions confirms that school-level 
      randomization did not occur.

      Criterion S is not met because the randomization was at the student level, not 
      the school level.

      The study only measured outcomes in English composition and reading, not all 
      main subjects, and did not use standardized exams.
    quote: >
      "We examined the impacts of corequisite remediation on the following 
      outcomes measured over one- and two-year intervals: passing a first college-level 
      English Composition course; passing other college-level courses, including a second 
      college-level English Composition course and a college-level reading course; total 
      accumulation of college-level credits; and persistence." (page 78)

      statewide administrative data held by THECB. These administrative data contain 
      information on course enrollment and grades for each student at all higher 
      education institutions in Texas." (page 90)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires measurement of all main subjects taught in the institution 
      using standardized exams. The study focuses solely on English-related outcomes 
      (e.g., English Composition and reading courses), omitting other core subjects 
      like mathematics or science. Additionally, as established under criterion E, the 
      assessments are based on course grades and administrative records, not 
      standardized exams. The lack of both comprehensive subject coverage and 
      standardized testing means criterion A is not met.

      Criterion A is not satisfied due to its limited subject scope and non-use of 
      standardized exams.

      instructional hours), and the course ran for 16 weeks for all colleges except 
      College E." (page 85)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires the intervention to last at least one full academic year 
      (approximately 9-10 months). The corequisite model is a single-semester 
      intervention, typically 16 weeks, or 8 weeks at College E. While outcomes were 
      tracked over one and two years, the intervention itself was confined to one 
      semester, falling short of a full year’s duration.

      Criterion Y is not met because the intervention did not span a full academic year.

    explanation: >
      The control group received the standard 'business as usual' treatment, which is 
      appropriate for testing the corequisite model as an alternative instructional 
      approach.
    quote: >
      "Students were randomly assigned to either corequisite remediation—a 
      college-level English Composition course paired with a concurrent reading 
      and writing DE support—or the traditional semester-long integrated reading 
      and writing DE course that was required prior to entering college-level 
      English." (page 78)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students were randomly assigned to either corequisite remediation or 
      the traditional semester-long integrated reading and writing DE course." 
      (page 78)

      2) "The traditional DE course in which control students enrolled was the same 
      across the participating colleges." (page 84)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B requires the control group to receive equivalent time and resources 
      unless the intervention explicitly tests additional resources as the treatment 
      variable. Here, the treatment group received the corequisite model (college-level 
      course plus DE support), while the control group received the standard 
      traditional DE course. The study tests the corequisite model as an alternative 
      instructional approach, not additional resources per se. Both groups were 
      enrolled in courses during the semester, with the control group receiving the 
      ‘business as usual’ treatment. The intervention’s design aligns with testing a 
      structural change rather than extra resources, making the control group’s 
      standard treatment appropriate.

      Criterion B is met because the control group received a comparable standard 
      treatment.

      Although the original study measured outcomes only up to two years, a follow-up 
      by the same research team tracked students through program completion (graduation).

      "Corequisites ... only have a small impact on the likelihood of completing college."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We examined the impacts of corequisite remediation on the following outcomes 
      measured over one- and two-year intervals..." (page 78)

      2) "To assess one- and two-year persistence, we examined the effect of corequisite 
      remediation on enrollment one and three semesters after..." (page 90)

      3) "Considering the enormous societal benefit of a college education, corequisites 
      are most likely the preferred policy from a societal point of view even when 
      they are more expensive to implement and given that they only have a small 
      impact on the likelihood of completing college." (Miller et al., 2023, p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking students until graduation to evaluate long-term 
      impacts. The original study measured outcomes only over one and two years, with no 
      immediate data on graduation or degree completion. However, a subsequent analysis 
      of the same student cohorts (Cunha et al., 2023) extended the follow-up through 
      college completion. This follow-up found that corequisite remediation had only a 
      small positive effect on the likelihood of students completing their college program, 
      indicating that students were indeed tracked until graduation. 

      Therefore, criterion G is now met because the research team followed the students 
      through graduation in a follow-up study.

      None applicable.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires the study to be independently replicated by a different 
      research team. The paper, published in 2022, does not reference any independent 
      replication of its specific RCT. While it cites prior studies on corequisite 
      remediation (e.g., Cho et al., 2012; Logue et al., 2016), these were not replications 
      of this study’s design or findings. No evidence of an external reproduction of 
      this exact experiment has been found.

      Criterion R is not met due to the absence of an independent replication of the study by another research team.

      The study was conducted by researchers independent from the designers of the 
      corequisite models.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "All of the participating colleges volunteered to participate in the study and 
      had established their own approaches to corequisite remediation prior to 
      participation." (page 84)

      2) "The research reported here was supported, in whole or in part, by the 
      Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through grants 
      [R305H170085 and R305N170003] to the American Institutes for Research and 
      [R305H150094] to the RAND Corporation." (page 98)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires the study to be conducted by a third-party evaluator, not the 
      intervention designers. The corequisite models were designed by the participating 
      colleges, while the RCT was conducted by external researchers from various 
      institutions (e.g., RAND Corporation, University of Texas at Dallas). Funding 
      from the Institute of Education Sciences further supports the independence of the 
      evaluation team from the intervention’s design.

      Criterion I is met because the researchers were independent from the model 
      designers.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires the study protocol to be pre-registered before data 
      collection begins. The paper does not mention pre-registration or provide a 
      registry ID. Data collection occurred from fall 2016 to fall 2017, and with no 
      evidence of a pre-registered plan, this criterion is not satisfied.

      Criterion P is not met due to the lack of a pre-registered protocol.
