abstract: >-
  Innovation fuels long-run economic growth, yet education systems in
  developing countries often overlook the skills required for
  innovation. This paper provides the first experimental evidence that
  students can learn core innovation-related skills. I conduct a
  large-scale clustered randomized controlled trial with 4,800
  eighth-grade students in India, comparing a two-year school-based
  innovation training program to a control group with access to
  self-directed project opportunities. Because existing measures of
  innovation are scarce and rarely validated in low-income school
  settings, I develop a novel, multi-method toolkit that includes a
  strategic exploration task, expert-rated idea quality assessments,
  and a live funding competition. Treated students significantly
  outperformed controls across all three domains (0.10-0.24 SD) and
  secured 24 percentage points more external funding.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study utilized a clustered randomized controlled trial
      design randomizing at the school level, which satisfies the
      requirement for class-level or higher randomization.
    quote: >-
      "The study was conducted as a clustered randomized controlled
      trial across 80 schools, with 40 assigned to treatment and 40 to
      control." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "I conduct a large-scale clustered randomized controlled
      trial with 4,800 eighth-grade students in India..." (p. 2)

      2) "The study was conducted as a clustered randomized controlled
      trial across 80 schools, with 40 assigned to treatment and 40 to
      control." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:
      The ERCT standard requires randomization at the class level or
      stronger (school level). The paper explicitly states that the
      randomization was conducted at the school level ("across 80
      schools"). This design avoids contamination within schools and
      satisfies the requirement for a robust randomization unit. Since
      school-level randomization is stronger than class-level, this
      criterion is met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met:
      Criterion C is met because the study randomized participants at
      the school level, exceeding the class-level requirement.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The primary innovation outcomes rely on custom-developed
      measures rather than standardized exams, although standardized
      tests were used for secondary academic outcomes.
    quote: >-
      "Because existing measures of innovation are scarce and rarely
      validated in low-income school settings, I develop a novel,
      multi-method toolkit..." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Because existing measures of innovation are scarce and
      rarely validated in low-income school settings, I develop a
      novel, multi-method toolkit that includes a strategic
      exploration task, expert-rated idea quality assessments, and a
      live funding competition." (p. 2)

      2) "I assess math and science performance to examine potential
      spillovers... using standardized assessments adapted from school
      textbooks and the Mindspark study (Muralidharan et al., 2019)."
      (p. 16)

      3) "I created the Innovation-S scale, a novel psychometric tool
      designed to measure the quality of innovative ideas... developed
      through a process involving in-depth interviews..." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:
      The ERCT standard requires the use of standardized exam-based
      assessments that are not specially designed for the study. While
      the secondary academic outcomes use "adapted" standardized
      assessments (Mindspark/textbooks), the primary outcomes related
      to the study's main research question (innovation) are explicitly
      described as a "novel... toolkit" and a "novel psychometric
      tool" (Innovation-S scale) developed by the author. The
      "multi-armed bandit task" is also an adaptation designed for the
      field. As the core assessments were created specifically for
      this research due to a lack of existing measures, this criterion
      is not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is not met:
      Criterion E is not met because the study relies on
      custom-developed measures (Innovation-S scale, adapted bandit
      task) for its primary outcomes rather than widely recognized
      standardized exams.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention spanned two full academic years, significantly
      exceeding the one-term duration requirement.
    quote: >-
      "The curriculum delivered 60 hours of training through weekly
      90-minute sessions over two academic years." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The curriculum delivered 60 hours of training through weekly
      90-minute sessions over two academic years." (p. 4)

      2) "I follow approximately 5,000 students from Grade 8 through
      Grade 9 during academic years 2022-2024." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:
      The standard requires outcomes to be measured at least one full
      academic term after the intervention begins. This study
      implemented the intervention over "two academic years"
      (2022-2024) with data collection at baseline, midline (end of
      Year 1), and endline (end of Year 2). This duration far exceeds
      the minimum requirement of one term.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met:
      Criterion T is met because the intervention and measurement
      period covered two full academic years.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control group's condition (self-directed preparation) and
      baseline characteristics are clearly documented and compared to
      the treatment group.
    quote: >-
      "Control schools received only information about an annual
      innovation challenge with detailed criteria but no structured
      training..." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Control schools received only information about an annual
      innovation challenge with detailed criteria but no structured
      training, similar to statewide challenges previously conducted
      by the Telangana government..." (p. 4)

      2) "Comparison group teams were encouraged to use this same time
      to develop their innovation ideas on their own." (p. 11)

      3) "Table 2 presents baseline characteristics and balance checks
      across treatment and control groups." (p. 17)

      Detailed Analysis:
      The paper provides a detailed description of the control group,
      specifying that they participated in "self-directed preparation"
      and received information about the challenge but no formal
      training. Table 2 exhaustively lists demographic information,
      baseline academic scores, and other characteristics for the
      control group alongside the treatment group. This satisfies the
      requirement for detailed documentation.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met:
      Criterion D is met because the study clearly describes the
      control group's activities and provides detailed baseline
      demographic and performance data.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study randomized 80 schools to treatment or control
      conditions, satisfying the school-level randomization
      requirement.
    quote: >-
      "The study was conducted as a clustered randomized controlled
      trial across 80 schools, with 40 assigned to treatment and 40 to
      control." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study was conducted as a clustered randomized controlled
      trial across 80 schools, with 40 assigned to treatment and 40 to
      control." (p. 3)

      2) "I employed a stratified randomization design... I randomly
      assigned 40 schools to the treatment group and 40 to the
      comparison group within each stratum." (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:
      The criterion requires randomization to occur at the school
      level. The author explicitly states that 80 schools were
      selected and randomly assigned (40 treatment, 40 control) using
      stratified randomization. This perfectly matches the requirement
      for School-level RCT.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is met:
      Criterion S is met because the randomization was performed at
      the school level across 80 different institutions.
  i:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention was implemented by an independent NGO
      (Inqui-Lab), while the evaluation was conducted by an academic
      researcher from Stanford.
    quote: >-
      "The intervention was implemented by Inqui-Lab Foundation... I
      conduct a large-scale clustered randomized controlled trial..."
      (pp. 2-4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The intervention was implemented by Inqui-Lab Foundation, an
      NGO founded by engineers-turned-teachers who developed a
      structured pedagogy..." (p. 4)

      2) "I conduct a large-scale clustered randomized controlled
      trial... Saloni Gupta... Stanford King Center on Global
      Development" (p. 2)

      3) "I am extremely grateful to the... Inqui-Lab Foundation...
      for their leadership and collaboration in this study." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:
      The standard requires the study to be conducted independently
      from the intervention designers. The text identifies "Inqui-Lab
      Foundation" as the entity that developed and implemented the
      program. The author (Saloni Gupta) is a researcher at Stanford
      University evaluating the program. This separation between the
      NGO delivering the program and the academic researcher
      evaluating it satisfies the independence criterion.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is met:
      Criterion I is met because the intervention was designed and
      implemented by Inqui-Lab Foundation, while the evaluation was
      conducted by an external academic researcher.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study tracked students over two full academic years,
      exceeding the one-year duration requirement.
    quote: >-
      "I follow approximately 5,000 students from Grade 8 through
      Grade 9 during academic years 2022-2024." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "I follow approximately 5,000 students from Grade 8 through
      Grade 9 during academic years 2022-2024." (p. 4)

      2) "The curriculum delivered 60 hours of training through weekly
      90-minute sessions over two academic years." (p. 4)

      3) "The experiment spans two academic years, with data
      collection at three primary points: baseline in August 2022,
      midline in March 2023... and endline in March 2024..." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:
      The criterion requires outcomes to be measured at least one full
      academic year after the intervention begins. This study tracked
      students and delivered the intervention over a period of two
      academic years (August 2022 to March 2024), clearly satisfying
      the year-long requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is met:
      Criterion Y is met because the study spans two academic years
      with start and end dates covering roughly 19 months.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention provided additional resources (kits, training)
      that were integral to the treatment being tested, while
      educational time was balanced across groups.
    quote: >-
      "This created a research design that tests whether structured
      training improves innovation outcomes compared to self-directed
      learning." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This created a research design that tests whether structured
      training improves innovation outcomes compared to self-directed
      learning." (p. 4)

      2) "Treatment schools scheduled their weekly 90-minute sessions
      during independent study periods... Comparison group teams were
      encouraged to use this same time to develop their innovation
      ideas on their own. Thus, both groups utilized the same
      independent study time allocation..." (p. 11)

      3) "Each classroom also received an 'innovation kit' valued at
      Rs. 15,000 ($180 USD)..." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:
      The study tests "structured training" (which includes curriculum
      and kits) against "self-directed learning." The treatment group
      received extra resources ($180 kits), which were not provided to
      the control group. However, the study explicitly frames the
      testing of this "structured training" (including the resources)
      as the treatment variable compared to self-directed efforts. The
      authors took specific steps to balance the *time* variable: both
      groups used the same "independent study periods" (90 mins/week),
      ensuring that the control group had comparable dedicated time
      for the task. Since the additional resources were an integral
      part of the treatment being tested and time was balanced, the
      criterion is met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met:
      Criterion B is met because the additional resources were
      integral to the treatment variable being tested, and educational
      time was strictly balanced between groups.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replications of this specific intervention were
      found in peer-reviewed literature.
    quote: >-
      "This paper provides the first experimental evidence that
      students can learn core innovation-related skills." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This paper provides the first experimental evidence that
      students can learn core innovation-related skills." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:
      The paper claims to provide the "first experimental evidence" on
      this topic. As of the check date, there are no available
      citations or references pointing to independent replications of
      the Inqui-Lab Foundation innovation curriculum by other research
      teams in different contexts published in peer-reviewed journals.
      The study is a working paper from 2025 and has not yet been
      reproduced externally.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is met:
      Criterion R is not met because this is an original study without
      referenced independent replications.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study assesses Math and Science but does not assess other
      core subjects like Language Arts or Social Studies using
      standardized exams.
    quote: >-
      "I assess math and science performance to examine potential
      spillovers to academic domains... I measure math and science
      achievement using standardized assessments..." (p. 16)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "I assess math and science performance to examine potential
      spillovers to academic domains... I measure math and science
      achievement using standardized assessments adapted from school
      textbooks..." (p. 16)

      2) "Table 6: Treatment Effects on Academic Outcomes... Math
      achievement... Science achievement" (p. 25)

      3) "I also gathered data on subject preferences across eight
      school subjects..." (p. 17)

      Detailed Analysis:
      The criterion requires measuring impact on "all main subjects
      taught in the school." While the author collected data on
      "subject preferences" for eight subjects, the actual *exam-based
      assessments* were strictly limited to Math and Science. There is
      no evidence of standardized testing for languages or social
      studies, which are core subjects in Grade 8/9 curricula. Furthermore,
      since criterion E (Exam-based Assessment) for the primary outcome
      was not met, criterion A also fails.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is met:
      Criterion A is not met because exams were limited to math and
      science only, excluding other core subjects.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study tracked students through Grade 9 but did not track
      them until graduation.
    quote: >-
      "I follow approximately 5,000 students from Grade 8 through
      Grade 9 during academic years 2022-2024." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "I follow approximately 5,000 students from Grade 8 through
      Grade 9 during academic years 2022-2024." (p. 4)

      2) "Endline Mar-2024... Funding Round Nov-2024" (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:
      The study concludes at the end of Grade 9 (with a competition in
      the following academic year). Graduation from secondary school
      in India typically occurs at Grade 10 or 12. The study explicitly
      states tracking occurred "from Grade 8 through Grade 9." No
      subsequent papers or follow-up studies were found tracking this
      specific cohort to graduation.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is met:
      Criterion G is not met because tracking ended at Grade 9 rather
      than continuing through graduation.
  p:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study was pre-registered with the AEA Trial Registry prior
      to the start of data collection.
    quote: >-
      "The RCT is registered with the AEA Trial Registry (RCT ID:
      AEARCTR-0009696)." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The RCT is registered with the AEA Trial Registry (RCT ID:
      AEARCTR-0009696)." (p. 2)

      2) "Baseline Aug-2022" (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:
      The paper identifies the registry ID AEARCTR-0009696. A check of
      the AEA Social Science Registry confirms that this trial ("Can
      Innovation be Taught? Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial
      in India") was registered. The registration date corresponds to
      July 2022, which is prior to the baseline data collection date
      of August 2022 stated in the paper.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is met:
      Criterion P is met because the study protocol was pre-registered
      before data collection began.
