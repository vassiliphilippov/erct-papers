abstract: >-
  Here we report a randomized, controlled trial measuring college students'
  learning and their perceptions when content is presented through an
  AI-powered tutor compared with an active learning class. The novel design of
  the custom AI tutor is informed by the same pedagogical best practices as
  employed in the in-class lessons. We find that students learn significantly
  more in less time when using the AI tutor, compared with the in-class active
  learning. They also feel more engaged and more motivated. These findings
  offer empirical evidence for the efficacy of a widely accessible AI-powered
  pedagogy in significantly enhancing learning outcomes, presenting a
  compelling case for its broad adoption in learning environments.

    explanation: >
      The study randomized students in small peer-instruction groups for a
      tutoring-style intervention, which satisfies the ERCT tutoring
      exception.
    quote: >
      "Through a design that involves targeted, content-rich prompt engineering,
      we developed an online tutor that uses GAI and best practices from
      pedagogy and educational psychology to promote learning in undergraduate
      science education." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "What if an AI tutor could mimic the learning experience one would get
      from an expert (human) tutor?" (p. 2)

      2) "Through a design that involves targeted, content-rich prompt
      engineering, we developed an online tutor that uses GAI and best
      practices from pedagogy and educational psychology to promote learning in
      undergraduate science education." (p. 2)

      3) "Students were randomly assigned to two groups, respecting the
      constraint that students who regularly worked together in class during
      peer instruction were placed in the same group in order to maximize the
      effectiveness of their in-class learning." (p. 7)

      4) "As mentioned above, keeping students with their peer-instruction
      groups meant that subjects were randomized at the level of these groups
      (2-3 students) rather than as individuals." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT C criterion requires randomization at the class level unless the
      intervention is personal tutoring (an explicit exception in the ERCT
      specification). This paper evaluates an AI tutor intended to mimic an
      expert human tutor and designed for individualized, on-demand feedback.
      The study randomized students at the level of small peer-instruction
      groups (2-3 students), not whole classes. Because the intervention is a
      tutoring system rather than a classroom-wide teaching method, the ERCT
      exception applies and student-level (or small-group) randomization is
      acceptable.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met/not met because the
      intervention is a tutoring system and the study uses a valid tutoring
      exception to the class-level randomization requirement.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study used custom lesson-specific pre- and post-tests rather than
      widely recognized standardized exams.
    quote: >
      "To prevent the specific test questions from influencing the teaching or
      AI tutor design, the tests were constructed by a separate team member
      from those involved in designing the AI or teaching the lessons." (p. 8)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To establish baseline knowledge, students from both groups completed
      a pre-test prior to each lesson, focusing on surface tension in the first
      week and fluid flow in the second. Following each lesson, students
      completed post-tests to measure content mastery and answered four
      questions aimed at gauging their learning experience, including
      engagement, enjoyment, motivation, and growth mindset." (p. 2)

      2) "To prevent the specific test questions from influencing the teaching
      or AI tutor design, the tests were constructed by a separate team member
      from those involved in designing the AI or teaching the lessons." (p. 8)

      3) "To prevent details of the lessons or AI prompts from influencing the
      test of learning, the tests were written based on the learning goals for
      the lesson and not the specific lesson content." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires outcome measures to be standardized, widely
      recognized exams rather than custom assessments designed for the study.
      The paper explicitly uses lesson-specific pre-tests and post-tests and
      describes how these tests were constructed for this study, including by
      a separate team member and aligned to lesson learning goals. This
      indicates the outcome assessments were custom-made rather than an
      external standardized exam.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is met/not met because the
      study's outcomes were measured with custom pre- and post-tests rather
      than standardized exams.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study ran across two consecutive weeks with immediate post-tests, so
      it did not measure outcomes at least one academic term after the
      intervention began.
    quote: >
      "In this study, students were divided into two groups, each experiencing
      two lessons, each with distinct teaching methodologies, in consecutive
      weeks." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In this study, students were divided into two groups, each
      experiencing two lessons, each with distinct teaching methodologies, in
      consecutive weeks." (p. 2)

      2) "Following each lesson, students completed post-tests to measure
      content mastery and answered four questions aimed at gauging their
      learning experience, including engagement, enjoyment, motivation, and
      growth mindset." (p. 2)

      3) "The study took place during one of the two meeting of the class
      during the ninth and tenth weeks of the course." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that outcomes are measured at least one full
      academic term after the intervention begins (roughly 3-4 months). The
      study uses a crossover design spanning two consecutive weeks and measures
      learning via post-tests administered immediately after each lesson. This
      is far shorter than one academic term from start to outcome measurement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met/not met because outcomes
      were measured within two consecutive weeks, not after at least one
      academic term.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The in-class active learning control condition and group characteristics
      are documented, including comparable demographics and baseline physics
      background knowledge.
    quote: >
      "The demographics of the two groups were comparable (see table S2A), as
      were previous measures of their physics background knowledge (see Table
      S2B)." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "During, the first week, group 1 engaged with an AI-supported lesson
      at home while group 2 participated in an active learning lesson in class."
      (p. 2)

      2) "The demographics of the two groups were comparable (see table S2A),
      as were previous measures of their physics background knowledge (see
      Table S2B)." (p. 7)

      3) "To make sure that the study design did not impact the effectiveness
      of in-person instruction during the experiment, students in class learned
      from the same instructors, with the same student:staff ratio, and in the
      same peer-instruction groups as they had throughout the course." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires a clearly documented control condition and enough
      detail to compare groups. The paper specifies what the control condition
      is (in-class active learning), when it occurred in the crossover, and
      that the two randomized groups had comparable demographics and baseline
      physics background knowledge (with referenced tables). It also describes
      how the in-class control was kept consistent with normal course
      operation, including instructors, staffing ratio, and peer-instruction
      groups.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met/not met because the
      control condition and baseline comparability are described in sufficient
      detail.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Randomization occurred within one university course, not at the school
      level.
    quote: >
      "We conducted a randomized controlled experiment in a large undergraduate
      physics course (N=194) at Harvard University, with a student population
      broadly representative of those found across a range of institutions, to
      measure the difference between 1) how much students learn and 2)
      students’ perceptions of the learning experience when identical material
      is presented through an AI tutor compared with an active learning
      classroom." (p. 2)

      2) "The present study took place during the Fall 2023 semester in
      Physical Sciences 2 (PS2), which is an introductory physics class for the
      life sciences and is Harvard’s largest physics class (N=233)." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the school level (different schools
      or sites assigned to conditions). This study is a within-course
      experiment in a single undergraduate class at Harvard University, with
      students assigned to conditions within that course. There is no
      school-level randomization.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is met/not met because
      randomization occurred within a single course rather than across schools.
  i:

    explanation: >
      The AI tutor was designed by the authors and the paper does not describe
      independent third-party conduct of the study.
    quote: >
      "A subset of the best practices (i-iii) were incorporated into the AI
      pedagogy by careful engineering of the AI tutor’s system prompt." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We have built an AI-based tutor, engineered with appropriate prompts
      and scaffolding, that helps students learn significantly more in less time
      and feel more engaged and motivated compared with in-class active
      learning." (p. 7)

      2) "A subset of the best practices (i-iii) were incorporated into the AI
      pedagogy by careful engineering of the AI tutor’s system prompt." (p. 4)

      3) "While the time commitment for preparation of a single AI-supported
      lesson was very manageable, there was significant overhead." (p. 8)

      4) "The most significant time commitment involved in preparing the
      AI-supported lessons was the development of an AI tutor platform software
      that took pedagogical best practices into consideration (e.g., structured
      around individual questions embedded in individual assignments), which
      took several months." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the study be conducted independently from the
      designers of the intervention. The paper describes the authors designing
      and building the AI tutor (including engineering the system prompt and
      building the AI tutor platform software). The paper does not identify an
      external, independent evaluation team for implementation or analysis.
      While the tests were constructed by a separate team member, this does not
      make the study independent from the intervention designers.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is met/not met because the
      authors designed the intervention and no independent third-party conduct
      is described.

    met: false
    explanation: >
      Outcomes were measured within a two-week crossover design, not after a
      full academic year.
    quote: >
      "In this study, students were divided into two groups, each experiencing
      two lessons, each with distinct teaching methodologies, in consecutive
      weeks." (p. 2)

      content mastery and answered four questions aimed at gauging their
      learning experience, including engagement, enjoyment, motivation, and
      growth mindset." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least one full academic year
      after the intervention begins. This study measures outcomes immediately
      after lessons in a two-week crossover design, so it does not satisfy a
      year-long tracking requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is met/not met because the
      study's tracking window is two weeks rather than a full academic year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The AI tutor condition substituted for the in-class lesson and did not
      add unmatched time or resources for the intervention group.
    quote: >
      "70% of students in the AI group spent less than 60 minutes on task, while
      30% spent more than 60 minutes on task. The median time on task for
      students in the AI group was 49 minutes." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "During a 75-minute period, the in-class students spent 15 minutes
      taking the pre- and post-tests; we assume 60 minutes spent on learning."
      (p. 2)

      2) "70% of students in the AI group spent less than 60 minutes on task,
      while 30% spent more than 60 minutes on task. The median time on task for
      students in the AI group was 49 minutes." (p. 2)

      3) "The content and worksheet for the control and experimental conditions
      were identical." (p. 7)

      4) "Given the crossover design, all students experienced both conditions
      once during the study." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B asks whether the intervention condition received additional
      time or resources that were not matched in the control condition, unless
      those additional resources are explicitly the treatment variable. Here,
      the AI lesson substitutes for the in-class lesson within a fixed course
      schedule. Time on task for the AI condition is comparable to, and
      typically lower than, the in-class lesson duration (median 49 minutes vs
      an assumed 60 minutes of learning in class). Both conditions use identical
      content and worksheets, and the crossover design ensures all students
      experience both conditions. These points support that there is no
      systematic extra time or budget given only to the intervention group that
      would confound the effect estimate.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met/not met because the AI
      tutor condition does not add unmatched instructional time or resources
      relative to the control condition.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      No independent peer-reviewed replication of this specific study by another
      research team was found.
    quote: >
      "Nonetheless, studies that explicitly replicate known in-class active
      learning results27,28 would be valuable for confirming and refining the
      details of this transferability." (p. 6)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Nonetheless, studies that explicitly replicate known in-class active
      learning results27,28 would be valuable for confirming and refining the
      details of this transferability." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication of this study by other
      authors in a peer-reviewed venue. The paper itself frames replication as
      a future direction rather than reporting an existing independent
      reproduction. Using web search across scholarly and publisher sources, I
      did not find a peer-reviewed paper by a different research team that
      explicitly reports a replication of this specific PS2 Pal crossover
      experiment and compares its results to the original.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is met/not met because no
      independent peer-reviewed replication of this specific study was found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Outcomes were limited to physics topics and the study did not use
      standardized exams across all main subjects (and criterion E is not met).
    quote: >
      "To establish baseline knowledge, students from both groups completed a
      pre-test prior to each lesson, focusing on surface tension in the first
      week and fluid flow in the second." (p. 2)

      content mastery and answered four questions aimed at gauging their
      learning experience, including engagement, enjoyment, motivation, and
      growth mindset." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all main
      subjects. This study measures learning only on the two physics lesson
      topics (surface tension and fluid flow) using pre- and post-tests
      constructed for the study. Additionally, ERCT requires that if criterion
      E is not met (no standardized exams), criterion A is not met either.
      Therefore, A is not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is met/not met because outcomes
      are limited to physics topics and were not measured via standardized exams
      across all main subjects.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study reports only immediate post-lesson outcomes and does not track
      students until graduation (and criterion Y is not met).
    quote: >
      "Following each lesson, students completed post-tests to measure content
      mastery and answered four questions aimed at gauging their learning

      growth mindset." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation. Per the ERCT
      rules, if criterion Y (year duration) is not met, criterion G cannot be
      met. This study's outcomes are measured immediately after lessons within
      a two-week crossover design and do not include long-term follow-up. I also
      searched for follow-up publications by the same authors that track this
      cohort to graduation and did not find any such papers describing
      graduation outcomes.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is met/not met because the study
      does not track students to graduation and does not meet the prerequisite
      year duration requirement.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The paper reports IRB approval but provides no evidence of a pre-registered
      protocol, and no matching public registry entry was found.
    quote: >
      "The present study was approved by the Harvard University IRB (study no.
      IRB23-0797) and followed a crossover design." (p. 7)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The present study was approved by the Harvard University IRB (study
      no. IRB23-0797) and followed a crossover design." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires a publicly accessible, time-stamped pre-registration
      of the study protocol before data collection begins. The paper reports
      IRB approval but does not provide a registry name, registration
      identifier, or link to a pre-registered protocol. I searched for a
      corresponding entry on major public registries commonly used for
      pre-registration (for example OSF and AsPredicted) using the title,
      authors, and study identifiers, and did not find a protocol that can be
      confidently matched to this study and dated prior to data collection.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is met/not met because no
      pre-registration record is cited in the paper and none was found in common
      public registries.
