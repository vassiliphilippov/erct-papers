  This study evaluated the effects of Group Triple P with Chinese parents on
  parenting and child outcomes as well as outcomes relating to child academic
  learning in Mainland China. Participants were 81 Chinese parents and their
  children in Shanghai, who were randomly allocated to an intervention group
  or wait-list control group. Parents in the intervention condition received
  Group Triple P training, and parents and children were assessed at three/two
  time points. Compared with the control group, parents in the intervention
  group reported significant improvements in child adjustment problems,
  parenting practices, parental adjustment, and parenting self-efficacy at post-
  assessment. Moreover, there was a significant increase in parents’ 
  satisfaction
  with children’s academic achievement and a reduction in children’s academic
  problem behaviors at post-intervention. All these effects were maintained at
  6-month follow-up. There was also a significant increase in the child report
  of positive parenting at post-intervention.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Eligible parents were randomly assigned by an independent person who 
      was not
      involved in the study at any stage to one of the two groups: intervention 
      group
      or wait-list control group." (p. 11) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomisation was carried out at the individual parent level rather than 
      at the
      class or school level. Participants were randomly allocated by number
      generator, indicating parent-level randomisation. ERCT C requires 
      randomising
      by entire class or higher unit unless tutoring; this design does not meet 
      that.

      Final sentence explaining the criterion C is not met because randomisation
      occurred at the individual level rather than by entire classes.
    explanation: >
      Randomisation was at the parent (individual) level, not at the class 
      level.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study used multiple custom and adapted questionnaires developed or
      adapted by the authors, with no standardised or widely recognised 
      exam-based
      assessment. All outcome measures were bespoke, failing the ERCT E 
      criterion.

      Final sentence explaining criterion E is not met because only custom
      questionnaires were used instead of standardised exams.

      1) "Intervention group parents and their children were also asked to

      the questionnaires 6 months after intervention." (p. 11) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      While immediate post‑intervention measures occurred at program end,
      a 6‑month follow‑up provided outcome data after more than one academic
      term (~9–10 months). This satisfies ERCT T requiring measurement at least
      one full term after intervention start.

      Final sentence explaining criterion T is met because outcomes were 
      measured
      at a six‑month follow‑up, exceeding one term duration.

      A six‑month follow‑up assessment provided outcome measurement after at

      2) "Parents in the wait‑list control group received Group Triple P after 
      they completed
      post‑assessment." (p. 6) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper provides clear documentation of the control (wait‑list) group,
      including sample size, demographic characteristics, and their treatment
      conditions (no intervention until post‑assessment). This meets ERCT D.

      Final sentence explaining criterion D is met because the control group is
      fully documented in demographics and conditions.
    explanation: >
      The wait‑list control group is described with detailed demographics and
      conditions.

      1) "Eligible parents were randomly assigned by an independent person..." 
      (p. 11) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomisation was at individual parent level; no school‑level assignment
      is described. ERCT S requires school‑level RCT, so this is not met.

      Final sentence explaining criterion S is not met because randomisation
      did not occur at the school level.
    explanation: >
      Randomisation occurred at the individual level, with no schools assigned 
      as units.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention delivery and assessment were performed by the paper’s
      authors themselves. No independent third‑party evaluator was involved,
      failing ERCT I.

      Final sentence explaining criterion I is not met because the same team
      designed and evaluated the program.

      The authors who designed the program also delivered and assessed it 
      without
      independent evaluation.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Follow‑up lasted six months, which is less than a full academic year 
      (~9–10 months).
      No year‑long tracking is reported, so ERCT Y is not met.

      Final sentence explaining criterion Y is not met because tracking did not
      extend to a full academic year.
    explanation: >
      Follow‑up lasted six months, shorter than the full academic year required.

      2) "Parents in the wait‑list control group received Group Triple P after 
      they completed
      post‑assessment." (p. 11) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention’s additional sessions and consultations are the core
      treatment variable. The control group was kept on business‑as‑usual by
      design. ERCT B allows this when extra resources are integral to the
      intervention.

      Final sentence explaining criterion B is met because extra training 
      resources
      are the primary treatment and control was business‑as‑usual.
    explanation: >
      The study explicitly tests additional training resources as the 
      intervention;
      the control group remained business‑as‑usual.

      Detailed Analysis:

      No independent replication by another team is reported in the paper. 
      No such replication has been published since, so ERCT R is not met.

      Final sentence explaining criterion R is not met because no replication
      is reported.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Only a six‑month follow‑up is reported; no tracking until graduation is
      provided. ERCT G is not met.

      Final sentence explaining criterion G is not met because there is no 
      tracking
      until graduation.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The trial was registered with the ANZCTR (ACTRN12613000660785)
      after it commenced, rather than before data collection. ERCT P requires 
      pre‑registration, a condition not met in this case.

      Final sentence explaining criterion P is not met because
      the study was not registered prior to data collection.
    explanation: >
      The study was registered after the trial began (ACTRN12613000660785), so it 
      was not truly pre‑registered.
