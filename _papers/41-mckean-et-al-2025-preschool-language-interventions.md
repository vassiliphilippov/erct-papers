abstract: >-
  Children's language abilities set the stage for their education,
  psychosocial development and life chances across the life course. Aims: To
  compare the efficacy of two preschool language interventions delivered with
  low dosages in early years settings (EYS): Building Early Sentences Therapy
  (BEST) and an Adapted Derbyshire Language Scheme (A-DLS). The former is
  informed by usage-based linguistic theory, the latter by typical language
  developmental patterns. Methods: We conducted a pre-registered cluster
  randomized controlled trial in 20 EYS randomized to receive BEST or A-DLS.
  Children aged 3;05-4;05, who were monolingual, with comprehension and/or
  production scores ≤ 16th centile (New Reynell Developmental Language
  Scales-NRDLS) and no sensorineural hearing impairment, severe visual
  impairment or learning disability were eligible. A total of 102 children
  received the intervention. Speech and language therapists delivered
  interventions with high fidelity in 15-min group sessions twice weekly for 8
  weeks. Baseline (T1), outcome (T2), and follow-up (T3) measures were
  completed blind to the intervention arm. Outcomes were NRDLS comprehension
  and production standard scores (SS), measures of language structures
  targeted in the interventions and communicative participation (FOCUS-34).
  Results: Both interventions were associated with significant change from T1
  to T2 and from T1 to T3 in all outcomes. There were no differences between
  interventions in gains in NRDLS comprehension SS at T2 or T3. BEST produced
  greater gains in NRDLS production SS between T1-T2 (d = 0.40) and T1-T3
  (d = 0.55) and in BEST-targeted sentences (d = 0.77).

      1) "We conducted a pre-registered cluster randomized controlled trial in
      20 EYS randomized to receive BEST or A-DLS." (p. 1)

      2) "Randomization of EYS to one of two intervention arms was conducted by
      a statistician not involved with the study." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper explicitly describes a cluster randomized controlled trial where
      the unit of randomization is the Early Years Setting (EYS). Because whole
      settings (schools) were randomized (a stronger design than class-level
      randomization), the ERCT Class-level RCT criterion is satisfied.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is met because entire Early Years Settings
      (schools) were randomized to intervention arms.

      measures of language structures targeted in the interventions and
      communicative participation (FOCUS-34)." (p. 1)

      2) "NRDLS is a standardized, normed reliable and valid omnibus language
      assessment that measures young children's comprehension and production
      abilities yielding SSs (Edwards et al. 2011)." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The primary outcomes include NRDLS comprehension and production standard
      scores. The paper describes NRDLS as a standardized, normed, reliable and
      valid assessment, which matches ERCT's requirement to use a recognized
      standardized exam-based measure rather than a bespoke test.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is met because the primary outcomes use the
      standardized NRDLS assessment.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Treatment was delivered by research assistants (RAs), who were
      qualified speech and language therapists (SLTs), to 102 preschool children
      twice a week for 8 weeks: 10 EYS in each of two waves." (p. 4)

      2) "Children were assessed by RAs blind to treatment arm allocation for
      eligibility (T0), before the intervention (T1), immediately after the
      intervention (T2) and at follow-up (T3 approximately 9 weeks after T2)."
      (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention lasted 8 weeks, and an additional follow-up assessment
      took place about 9 weeks after the post-intervention assessment. This
      implies that the final outcomes (T3) were measured about 17 weeks after
      the intervention began (8 + 9 weeks), which is roughly 4 months and meets
      the "at least one academic term" requirement. Although the immediate
      post-test (T2) occurs at 8 weeks, ERCT allows short interventions if
      there is term-long follow-up tracking.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is met because outcomes were tracked to T3,
      about 17 weeks after the intervention started.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The most significant change was the removal of a TAU arm." (p. 4)

      2) "This study compares the efficacy of two interventions: Building Early
      Sentences Therapy (BEST) (McKean et al. 2013) and an adaptation of the
      Derbyshire Language Scheme (DLS) (Knowles and Masidlover 1982)." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion D requires a documented control group that receives only
      standard schooling ("business as usual") with no special treatment. This
      trial removed the treatment-as-usual (TAU) arm and instead compares two
      active interventions (BEST vs A-DLS). Because no group received only usual
      provision, the study does not include the required documented
      business-as-usual control condition.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is not met because the treatment-as-usual
      control arm was removed and both groups received active interventions.
    quote: >-

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A total of 20 EYS were allocated to receive either BEST or A-DLS in
      two waves to avoid contamination within an EYS and enable group delivery."
      (p. 4)

      2) "Randomization of EYS to one of two intervention arms was conducted by
      a statistician not involved with the study." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The unit of randomization is the Early Years Setting (EYS), which is the
      educational site implementing the intervention. Entire settings were
      allocated to BEST or A-DLS, which satisfies the ERCT requirement that
      randomization occurs at the school/site level rather than within a
      school.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is met because whole Early Years Settings were
      randomized to intervention arms.
    quote: >-
      Randomization of EYS to one of two intervention arms was conducted by a

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Funding for the development of Building Early Sentences Therapy
      (BEST) was provided by Newcastle University." (p. 1)

      2) "Prior to intervention delivery in the trial, RAs were trained in the
      interventions by C.M. and S.P.; this included video recording their
      delivery of interventions, reflecting on their fidelity and receiving
      feedback from S.P. and C.M. using that rating scale." (p. 6)

      3) "Masidlover, one of the original creators of DLS, created new DLS
      materials for each activity and provided detailed feedback and advice in
      the development of the manual and approach." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion I requires the evaluation to be conducted independently of
      the intervention designers. Here, the paper reports that BEST development
      was funded at Newcastle University and that named authors (C.M. and S.P.)
      trained the delivering staff and provided fidelity feedback. The paper
      also states that an original DLS creator (Masidlover) contributed to
      materials development for A-DLS. This indicates that intervention
      developers were directly involved in implementation support, so the
      conduct is not independent (despite use of an external statistician for
      randomization).

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because intervention developers
      were directly involved in training, fidelity feedback, and materials
      development for the evaluated interventions.

      intervention (T2) and at follow-up (T3 approximately 9 weeks after T2)."
      (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The longest follow-up reported is approximately 9 weeks after the
      immediate post-intervention assessment, following an 8-week intervention.
      This corresponds to about 17 weeks of tracking from the start of
      intervention to the final measurement, which is far less than an academic
      year (roughly 9-10 months). Therefore the Year Duration requirement is not
      satisfied.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because participant outcomes were
      tracked for only about 17 weeks, not a full academic year.

      1) "Comparing interventions delivered with the same dosage, delivery
      context, level of treatment fidelity and similar resources, tests whether
      it is the specific learning mechanisms/active ingredients exploited by
      the interventions which promote change or simply 'therapy general' effects
      (Frizelle and McKean 2022)." (p. 2)

      2) "We created an adapted version of DLS (A-DLS) which could be delivered
      with high treatment fidelity and reliability in a research context and
      which matched BEST as closely as possible in terms of dosage and delivery
      whilst retaining DLS key principles and characteristics." (p. 6)

      3) "Following each session parents are given a homework booklet
      containing pictures of the verbs targeted in the session with a range of
      agents and patients." (p. 6)

      4) "Homework packs for each activity were developed and provided together
      with guidance videos for parents" (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      This is a head-to-head comparison of two active interventions rather than
      an intervention vs business-as-usual design. Both arms received a
      comparable overall dose (group sessions twice weekly for 8 weeks) and both
      included parent homework materials. The authors explicitly state that
      A-DLS was adapted to match BEST in dosage and delivery, supporting balance
      of time and resource inputs across arms. Under the updated ERCT criterion
      B decision logic, extra resources are present, but the comparator arm
      matches them, so the comparison is not confounded by extra time/budget.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is met because the two study arms were
      explicitly matched for dosage, delivery, and homework resources.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In a quasi-experimental pilot study, Trebacz et al. (2024) found that
      BEST produced greater standard scores (SSs) gains in expressive language
      than a treatment-as-usual control but not comprehension." (p. 2)

      2) "In an RCT, Broomfield and Dodd (2011) demonstrated that DLS was
      associated with improvements in comprehension but not production when
      compared to a wait-list control." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion R requires an independent replication of this study (or its
      core intervention comparison) by a different research team in a different
      context, published in a peer-reviewed journal. The current paper cites a
      prior BEST pilot study (Trebacz et al., 2024) and a prior DLS RCT
      (Broomfield and Dodd, 2011). However, Trebacz is an author on the current
      paper, so this pilot is not independent of the current author team. The
      Broomfield and Dodd trial evaluates DLS in a different design and does
      not replicate this paper's head-to-head BEST vs A-DLS cluster RCT.
      Internet search did not identify any peer-reviewed, independent
      replications of this 2025 head-to-head trial as of the ERCT check date.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because no independent,
      peer-reviewed replication of this study was found.

      1) "Outcomes were NRDLS comprehension and production standard scores (SS),

      communicative participation (FOCUS-34)." (p. 1)

      2) "Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales-Vineland-3 were completed by the
      child's teacher at T0, to characterize children's non-verbal and broader
      developmental profiles (Sparrow et al. 2016)." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all main
      subjects (or an explicitly justified exception). This preschool language
      trial evaluates outcomes in language and communicative participation only
      (NRDLS and related language measures). Vineland-3 is used at baseline to
      characterize participants, not as an outcome across subject areas.
      Therefore the study does not assess effects across the broader set of
      curriculum domains, so criterion A is not satisfied. (Criterion E is met,
      but A has the additional requirement of multi-subject coverage.)

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because outcomes were limited to
      language and communication rather than all main subjects/domains.

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation. This
      study reports only short-term follow-up (weeks to a few months) after the
      intervention, and explicitly states that longer-term follow-up is needed.
      In addition, ERCT specifies that if criterion Y is not met, then G is not
      met; here, Y is not met because tracking is far shorter than an academic
      year. A search for subsequent peer-reviewed follow-up papers by the same
      author team tracking this cohort to school-stage graduation did not
      identify any such publications as of the ERCT check date.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because the cohort was not tracked
      to any graduation milestone, only short-term follow-up.

      5) "01/02/2020" (ISRCTN record, p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper reports that the trial was pre-registered and provides the
      public registry identifier (ISRCTN10974028). The ISRCTN registry record
      shows a registration date of 08/01/2020 and a first enrolment date of
      01/02/2020, meaning the record was registered before recruitment began.
      This satisfies ERCT criterion P's requirement that the protocol be
      registered before the study starts.
