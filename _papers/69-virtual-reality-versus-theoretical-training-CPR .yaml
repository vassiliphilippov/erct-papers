  Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a virtual
  reality (VR)-based cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training
  program compared with traditional theoretical instruction and a
  non-intervention control group, on improving and retaining
  knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy of secondary school
  students. Design Randomized trial with three parallel groups and
  longitudinal follow-up at baseline (T0), immediate post-intervention
  (T-Immediate), one-month follow-up (T-Month), and twelve-month
  follow-up (T-Year). Participants: 102 secondary school students
  (aged 14–15 years) from the Region of Murcia, Spain were randomly
  assigned to three groups (n = 34 each). Intervention: Group 1:
  immersive VR training (interactive 360° video); Group 2: Traditional
  theoretical training; Group 3: control (no intervention). The
  primary outcome was the objective CPR knowledge. The secondary
  outcomes were attitude towards CPR, perceived self-efficacy, and
  system usability (only in the VR group), and correlations between
  motivational variables and knowledge. Results: All groups showed
  changes after the intervention, but improvements were significantly
  greater in the two instructional groups. The VR group achieved the
  highest scores in knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy immediately
  after the intervention (p < 0.001), and maintained more stable
  results at 1-month and 1-year follow-ups as compared to the
  theoretical group, whose initial gains declined over time. The
  control group did not show relevant changes in any of the variables.
  Additionally, the System Usability Scale (SUS) (0–100) of the VR
  system was rated positively (SUS = 75.3 ± 4.5), supporting its
  applicability in educational contexts. Conclusions: Both virtual
  reality training and theoretical instruction were effective in
  improving cardiopulmonary resuscitation knowledge, attitudes, and
  self-efficacy among adolescents. However, virtual reality showed a
  greater long-term retention of effects and received high usability
  ratings, reinforcing its potential as an educational tool in school
  settings.

    explanation: >-
      Randomization was performed at the individual student level, not
      at the class (or higher) level, and the intervention was not a
      one-to-one tutoring intervention.
    quote: >-
      "The random assignment was performed individually, in a 1:1:1
      ratio, through a sequence of random numbers generated by a

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The random assignment was performed individually, in a 1:1:1
      ratio, through a sequence of random numbers generated by a
      computer (RAND function in Excel)." 

      2) "Firstly, it was conducted in a single school, which benefitted
      the follow-up, but restricted the generalization of the findings
      to other contexts, levels of education, or regions."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomization at the class level (or stronger,
      such as school-level) to reduce contamination within classrooms,
      unless the intervention is explicitly one-to-one tutoring/personal
      teaching.

      The paper explicitly states that "random assignment was performed
      individually," and also indicates the study was "conducted in a
      single school." Individual (student-level) randomization in a
      single school implies that students who share classes/teachers can
      end up in different arms, creating the contamination risk that
      Criterion C is intended to avoid. The intervention is CPR training
      delivered as a program (VR experience or a short theoretical
      class), not one-to-one tutoring.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is not met because students were
      randomized individually rather than by class (or school), with no
      tutoring-style exception stated.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The primary educational outcome used a study-specific set of
      multiple-choice questions rather than a widely recognized
      standardized exam.
    quote: >-
      "Knowledge. This is the main study variable. The same ten
      multiple-choice questions were used in all groups, with identical
      wording and scoring."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Knowledge. This is the main study variable. The same ten
      multiple-choice questions were used in all groups, with identical
      wording and scoring."

      2) "Although no separate validation study was conducted, all items
      were reviewed by experts in CPR education to confirm content
      equivalence."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires a standardized, widely recognized exam-based
      assessment (e.g., national/state standardized tests), not an
      instrument created or assembled specifically for the study.

      The paper describes the main outcome as "ten multiple-choice
      questions" used across groups. The authors note expert review but
      also state "no separate validation study was conducted," and they
      do not identify any widely recognized external standardized exam.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because the study used a
      study-specific set of ten multiple-choice items rather than a
      recognized standardized exam.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured up to a twelve-month follow-up after the
      intervention began, which exceeds the minimum term-length
      requirement.
    quote: >-
      "A randomized trial was designed with three parallel lines and
      longitudinal follow-up at four different time points:
      pre-intervention (T-0), immediate assessment after the
      intervention (T-Immediate), follow-up after a month (T-Month),
      and after twelve months (T-Year)."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A randomized trial was designed with three parallel lines and
      longitudinal follow-up at four different time points:
      pre-intervention (T-0), immediate assessment after the
      intervention (T-Immediate), follow-up after a month (T-Month),
      and after twelve months (T-Year)."

      2) "The collection of data was performed between February 6th,
      2024, and February 14th, 2025."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires educational outcomes to be measured at least
      one academic term (about 3–4 months) after the intervention begins
      (allowing short interventions, but requiring term-long follow-up).

      The paper specifies an "after twelve months (T-Year)" follow-up and
      provides concrete dates that span from February 2024 to February
      2025. This is substantially longer than a single academic term.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is met because the study includes a
      twelve-month follow-up after the intervention began.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control group is clearly described (no intervention) and the
      paper reports group sizes and baseline characteristics for all
      groups (e.g., Table 1).
    quote: >-
      "Group 3: Control Group. This group did not receive training
      during the study but was assessed at the same time points."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Group 3: Control Group. This group did not receive training
      during the study but was assessed at the same time points."

      2) "Participants: 102 secondary school students (aged 14–15 years)
      from the Region of Murcia, Spain were randomly assigned to three
      groups (n = 34 each)."

      3) "Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of the
      participating students."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control group be well documented,
      including what it received (or did not receive), and information
      enabling baseline comparability (e.g., demographics and baseline
      measures).

      The paper explicitly defines the control condition as no training
      and states it was assessed at the same time points. It also
      reports allocation sizes and includes a baseline characteristics
      table (Table 1) covering demographics and relevant prior
      experience variables.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the control group
      condition, allocation, and baseline characteristics are described.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The trial was not randomized at the school level (it was conducted
      in a single school with individual-level assignment).
    quote: >-
      "Firstly, it was conducted in a single school, which benefitted
      the follow-up, but restricted the generalization of the findings
      to other contexts, levels of education, or regions."

      the follow-up, but restricted the generalization of the findings
      to other contexts, levels of education, or regions."

      2) "The random assignment was performed individually, in a 1:1:1
      ratio, through a sequence of random numbers generated by a
      computer (RAND function in Excel)."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level (site-level) randomization across
      multiple schools/sites.

      The paper states the trial was conducted in a single school and
      that randomization was performed individually. With only one
      school and individual allocation, school-level randomization is
      not present.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met because the study used one
      school and randomized individuals rather than randomizing schools.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Allocation concealment involved an independent researcher, but the
      paper does not show that the intervention evaluation was conducted
      by an external, independent team.
    quote: >-
      "The sequence was applied by an independent researcher, unrelated
      to the intervention and the collection of data, to maintain the
      allocation concealed."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The sequence was applied by an independent researcher,
      unrelated to the intervention and the collection of data, to
      maintain the allocation concealed."

      2) "The interpretation of results, statistical analyses, and all
      scientific conclusions were entirely performed and verified by the
      research team."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires the study to be conducted independently from
      the authors who designed the intervention, typically via third-
      party evaluators for implementation and/or data collection and
      analysis.

      The paper provides evidence of independence only for applying the
      randomization sequence (allocation concealment). It also states
      that interpretation and analyses were performed by the research
      team. The paper does not provide a clear statement that an
      external/independent evaluation team implemented the intervention
      and/or conducted outcome assessment and analysis independently of
      the intervention developers.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because independence is only
      evidenced for allocation concealment, not for overall conduct and
      evaluation.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study tracked outcomes from February 2024 to February 2025,
      which is approximately one full year and exceeds 75% of an
      academic year.
    quote: >-
      "The collection of data was performed between February 6th, 2024,
      and February 14th, 2025."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A randomized trial was designed with three parallel lines and
      longitudinal follow-up at four different time points:
      pre-intervention (T-0), immediate assessment after the
      intervention (T-Immediate), follow-up after a month (T-Month),
      and after twelve months (T-Year)."

      2) "The collection of data was performed between February 6th,
      2024, and February 14th, 2025."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcomes be measured at least 75% of one
      academic year after the intervention begins.

      The paper specifies a twelve-month follow-up (T-Year) and provides
      dates spanning roughly one year from February 2024 to February
      2025. This exceeds the 75% threshold used by ERCT for a
      year-duration study.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is met because the study includes a
      twelve-month follow-up with dates spanning about one year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention arms received additional instructional inputs
      (training time and VR equipment), while the control arm received
      no training; this imbalance is explicitly the intended treatment
      comparison (training vs no training).
    quote: >-
      "This study evaluated the effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR)-
      based cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training program
      compared with traditional theoretical instruction and a
      non-intervention control group, on improving and retaining
      knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy of secondary school
      students."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study evaluated the effectiveness of a virtual reality
      (VR)-based cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training program
      compared with traditional theoretical instruction and a
      non-intervention control group, on improving and retaining
      knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy of secondary school
      students."

      2) "The scenario lasted approximately 10 min and covered key
      learning objectives, including safety assessment, consciousness
      and breathing checks, activation of Emergency Medical Services
      (EMS), chest compressions, and correct AED application
      (Supplementary Material 1)."

      3) "Group 2: Traditional theoretical training Group. The students
      received a 10-minute in-person theoretical class about how to act
      during emergencies, with content that was equivalent to the VR
      group."

      4) "Group 3: Control Group. This group did not receive training
      during the study but was assessed at the same time points."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B requires balanced time/resources across groups unless
      the extra time/budget/resources are explicitly the treatment
      variable being tested.

      Here, extra instructional inputs clearly exist: (a) the VR group
      used VR equipment and completed an approximately 10-minute VR
      scenario, and (b) the theoretical group received a 10-minute
      in-person class. The control group received no training.

      Under the ERCT criterion-B decision rule, this imbalance is
      acceptable if the study explicitly tests the effect of providing
      the additional educational resource itself (CPR training) versus a
      non-intervention control. The quoted objective and intervention
      descriptions show that the intended comparison includes a
      "non-intervention control group," i.e., the absence of the extra
      resources is part of the treatment definition rather than an
      unacknowledged confound.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is met because providing CPR training
      (including its time/equipment) is explicitly the treatment being
      tested against a non-intervention control group.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication of this specific trial was identified,
      and the paper itself does not report being replicated.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None found in the paper text indicating this study was replicated
      by an independent team in a different context.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication of the study (or a
      clearly stated replication of the same intervention/trial design)
      by a different research team, published in a peer-reviewed venue.

      This article reports a single randomized trial and does not
      describe an independent replication in the paper text. A search
      for replication studies specifically referencing and reproducing
      this exact trial did not identify any peer-reviewed replication
      papers.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because no independent
      replication of this specific trial could be identified.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Because the study does not use standardized exams (Criterion E is
      not met), it also cannot satisfy the all-subject standardized exam
      requirement.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Knowledge. This is the main study variable. The same ten
      multiple-choice questions were used in all groups, with identical
      wording and scoring."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires measuring impact across all main subjects
      using standardized exam-based assessments, and it is explicitly
      dependent on Criterion E being met.

      This study uses a study-specific CPR knowledge questionnaire (ten
      multiple-choice questions) rather than standardized exams.
      Therefore, Criterion E is not met, which implies Criterion A is
      not met under the ERCT prerequisite rule.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because the study does not
      use standardized exams (fails E), so it cannot meet the all-subject
      standardized exam requirement.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study includes a twelve-month follow-up but does not report
      tracking participants until graduation; no follow-up graduation
      paper by the same authors was identified.
    quote: >-
      "A randomized trial was designed with three parallel lines and
      longitudinal follow-up at four different time points:
      pre-intervention (T-0), immediate assessment after the

      intervention (T-Immediate), follow-up after a month (T-Month), and
      after twelve months (T-Year)."

      2) "Future studies should incorporate objective measurements of
      practical skills on CPR and AED use, explore retention in a longer
      term, and validate these findings with broader and multi-center
      samples."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires follow-up tracking until graduation from the
      relevant educational stage. (Also, because Criterion Y is met, the
      paper is eligible to be evaluated for G; it is not automatically
      disqualified by the ERCT dependency rule.)

      The paper clearly defines the longest follow-up as "after twelve
      months (T-Year)." It does not state that participants were tracked
      through graduation from their educational stage (e.g., completion
      of compulsory secondary education). Consistent with this, the
      authors discuss that future work should "explore retention in a
      longer term," implying that longer-term tracking (which could
      include graduation outcomes) was not performed here.

      A targeted search for subsequent cohort follow-up publications by
      the same author team reporting graduation outcomes for these
      participants did not identify any such paper.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because the reported
      follow-up ends at 12 months and no graduation-tracking follow-up
      paper for this cohort was identified.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper reports ethics approval and data-collection dates but
      does not state that a protocol was pre-registered or provide a
      registry ID and registration date.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the
      Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM), with code CE112309."

      2) "The collection of data was performed between February 6th,
      2024, and February 14th, 2025."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires an explicit statement of pre-registration,
      including a registry/platform and timing showing registration
      occurred before data collection began.

      The paper provides ethics approval information and clearly states
      the data-collection window. However, it does not provide a
      pre-registration registry name/link, a registration identifier, or
      a registration date. A targeted search for a publicly available
      pre-registration record corresponding to this trial did not locate
      a matching protocol entry.

      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met because no pre-registration
      registry, ID, or pre-data-collection registration timing is stated
      or could be verified.

## Change Summary

- Added `paper_link` (DOI landing page), `pdf_link` (direct PDF), and
  `date_erct_check` (set to 2026-02-13). ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666520425003157?utm_source=openai))
- Updated quotes across criteria to match the paper’s wording as shown
  in the full text version (and removed page-number claims because the
  accessible full text view does not expose stable PDF page numbers).
  ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12756614/))
- Re-checked criteria **G**, **R**, and **P** using online searches:
  no graduation-tracking follow-up paper for this cohort, no
  independent replication paper, and no pre-registration record were
  found; the corresponding sections remain **not met** but now include
  clearer justification. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41487947/?utm_source=openai))
- Rewrote criterion **B** analysis to comply with the updated ERCT
  criterion-B guidance (explicitly describing time/equipment inputs and
  why they are integral to the treatment comparison). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12756614/))
- Recomputed `erct_level`; it remains **0** because Level 1 criteria
  are not all met (C and E are not met). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12756614/))
