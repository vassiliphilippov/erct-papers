abstract: >-
  This study investigates the effectiveness of brief reflection interventions
  designed to support self-regulated learning in a short, Massive Open Online
  Course for in-service teachers. Two types of text-based reflection prompts
  were tested in a randomised controlled trial with over 5,000 participants.
  Learners were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) directed prompts
  focused on specific self-regulated learning strategies, (2) generic prompts
  promoting general reflection, and (3) a control group with no prompts. The
  study examined four outcome variables: pages completed, course completion
  rate, test attempts, and highest test score. No statistically significant
  differences were found between the experimental and control groups across any
  of the outcomes. Additionally, small negative effects were observed among
  learners with initially high self-regulated learning skills, contrary to
  expectations of a 'Matthew effect'. These findings suggest that brief, one-
  time text-based reflection prompts may be insufficient to improve engagement
  or performance in short online courses, highlighting the need for more
  sustained, adaptive, and interactive SRL interventions in MOOC settings.

criteria:
  c:
    met: false
    explanation: Randomisation was at the individual learner level, not classes.
    quote: >-
      Learners were randomly assigned to one of three versions upon clicking
      the ‘participate’ button.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Learners were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) prompts
      directly reflecting specific SRL strategies (directed prompts), (2)
      prompts reflecting general reflection (generic prompts), and (3) a control
      group with no prompts." (p. 2)

      2) "The study sample comprised all learners who enrolled in the course
      between autumn 2021 and spring 2022. Randomisation was achieved by
      duplicating the initial course and adding prompts. Learners were randomly
      assigned to one of three versions upon clicking the ‘participate’
      button." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomisation at the class level (or stronger), to
      avoid within-class contamination, unless the intervention is clearly
      personal tutoring. The paper describes a MOOC where individual learners
      are assigned to versions of the course at the moment they click the
      participation button. No class-level unit exists here, and the paper does
      not frame the intervention as one-to-one tutoring. Therefore, the unit of
      randomisation is individual learners, which does not satisfy the ERCT
      class-level requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is not met because randomisation
      occurred at the individual learner level rather than at the class (or
      school) level.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: Outcomes used a course-specific final test rather than a
      recognised standardised exam.
    quote: >-
      A final multiple-choice test, upon successful completion, granted
      learners a certificate of advanced training.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A final multiple-choice test, upon successful completion, granted
      learners a certificate of advanced training." (p. 5)

      2) "Final test results (had 14 questions with multiple choice and drag
      and drop);" (p. 6)

      3) "The study utilised four dependent variables to operationalise
      learners’ results: ... (4) the highest score attained on the final test
      – to indicate achievements." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires a standardised, widely recognised exam-based
      assessment, not an assessment created for (or specific to) the studied
      course/platform. The paper’s achievement measure is the MOOC’s internal
      “final multiple-choice test” (14 items) used to award a course
      certificate. The paper does not describe this as a national/state exam or
      any externally validated standardised test used beyond this course.
      Therefore, the assessment does not meet ERCT’s exam-based requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is not met because the outcomes
      rely on a course-specific final test rather than a recognised
      standardised exam.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: Outcomes were measured within a short-duration course without
      term-long follow-up.
    quote: >-
      First, the intervention was brief and limited to short text-based prompts
      within a short-duration course.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study investigates the effectiveness of brief reflection
      interventions designed to support self-regulated learning in a short,
      Massive Open Online Course for in-service teachers." (p. 2)

      2) "First, the intervention was brief and limited to short text-based
      prompts within a short-duration course." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that outcomes be measured at least one full academic
      term after the intervention begins (roughly 3-4 months), even if the
      intervention itself is brief. The paper characterises the course as
      “short” and later explicitly calls it a “short-duration course,” with the
      intervention embedded in-module and outcomes defined as course activity
      and final-test performance within that same course. The paper provides no
      evidence of a term-later follow-up measurement after course completion.
      Therefore, the study does not satisfy the ERCT term-duration follow-up
      requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is not met because the study does
      not report outcome measurement at least one academic term after the
      intervention began.
  d:
    met: false
    explanation: The control condition is described, but baseline and full
      control-group characteristics are not documented for most participants.
    quote: >-
      The Control Group (CG) did not receive any questions and studied the
      course without any additional reflection tasks; at the end of each unit
      they had only the page with congratulations and the link to download unit
      materials.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The Control Group (CG) did not receive any questions and studied the
      course without any additional reflection tasks; at the end of each unit
      they had only the page with congratulations and the link to download unit
      materials." (p. 6)

      2) "The completion of the questionnaire was optional for the students."
      (p. 6)

      3) "It is worth noting that upon dividing the participants into groups,
      the sample size becomes considerably smaller (partly due to not all
      participants undertaking the questionnaire), potentially leading to an
      insufficient sample size for detecting the significance of the effect."
      (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires a well-documented control group, including baseline
      information and key characteristics that allow readers to judge
      comparability. The paper clearly describes what the control group
      received (no prompts), but it states that the survey capturing learner
      characteristics was optional. It also notes that subgroup analyses are
      limited because not all participants completed the questionnaire. The
      paper does not provide comprehensive baseline performance measures (for
      example, prior achievement) and does not demonstrate that the full
      control group’s characteristics are documented beyond the optional survey
      subset. Therefore, the control group is not sufficiently documented for
      ERCT purposes.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is not met because baseline and
      participant characteristics for the control group are incomplete due to
      optional data collection and limited reporting.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: Randomisation was not conducted at the school (institution)
      level.
    quote: >-
      Learners were randomly assigned to one of three versions upon clicking
      the ‘participate’ button.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Learners were randomly assigned to one of three versions upon
      clicking the ‘participate’ button." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomisation at the school (or equivalent
      institution/site) level. The study is a MOOC experiment in which
      individual learners are assigned to one of three course versions at the
      point of participation. No schools or institutional units are randomised.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is not met because the unit of
      randomisation is individual learners, not schools or equivalent
      institutions.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: The paper describes the authors implementing the intervention
      themselves rather than an independent evaluator.
    quote: >-
      To do this, we conducted a randomised control trial that prompted
      learners’ reflection by adding different questions to the course content.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To do this, we conducted a randomised control trial that prompted
      learners’ reflection by adding different questions to the course content."
      (p. 3)

      2) "We integrated self-regulation tasks directly into the course..."
      (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires the study to be conducted independently from the
      designers of the intervention. The paper uses first-person language to
      describe conducting the trial and integrating the prompts into the course,
      indicating the intervention designers and the evaluators are the same
      team. The paper does not provide evidence of an external, independent
      evaluation organisation responsible for implementation and analysis.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is not met because the same team
      that designed and embedded the prompts also conducted the evaluation, with
      no documented independent evaluator.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: Outcomes were not tracked for a full academic year after the
      intervention began.
    quote: >-
      The study sample comprised all learners who enrolled in the course
      between autumn 2021 and spring 2022.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study sample comprised all learners who enrolled in the course
      between autumn 2021 and spring 2022." (p. 7)

      2) "First, the intervention was brief and limited to short text-based
      prompts within a short-duration course." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least one academic year after
      the intervention begins. The paper describes enrolment spanning autumn
      2021 to spring 2022, but it does not describe year-later outcome tracking
      for participants after their intervention exposure. Instead, it frames
      the course as “short-duration” and analyses outcomes tied to course
      engagement and course test performance. There is no evidence of
      measurement one academic year after intervention start for any cohort.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is not met because the paper does
      not report year-later tracking of outcomes after the intervention began.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: Any added time from writing responses is the treatment itself
      and is described as minimal.
    quote: >-
      Finally, even when participants formally completed the reflection task,
      the minimal input required (three characters) may not have elicited
      substantive cognitive engagement, limiting the actual impact of the
      intervention.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The Control Group (CG) did not receive any questions and studied the
      course without any additional reflection tasks..." (p. 6)

      2) "To answer each question, learners were offered a text field, the
      answer was counted if they used at least three characters." (p. 6)

      3) "Finally, even when participants formally completed the reflection
      task, the minimal input required (three characters) may not have elicited
      substantive cognitive engagement, limiting the actual impact of the
      intervention." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B requires comparable time/resources across groups unless the
      additional time/resource is the treatment variable or the difference is
      negligible. Here, the only added “resource” is requiring learners in the
      two prompt conditions to type short responses in a text field, while the
      control group receives no prompts. The study’s explicit treatment is the
      presence/type of reflection prompts (and the act of responding to them),
      so the time-on-task difference is integral to what is being tested.
      Additionally, the paper indicates the threshold for counting engagement is
      “at least three characters,” and later characterises this as “minimal
      input,” supporting that the added burden is small.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met because the added time for
      typing responses is the treatment being tested and is described as minimal.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: No independent replication of this specific RCT is identified.
    quote: >-
      As far as we know, this research is the first attempt to draw attention
      to the existence of different prompt types in SRL in MOOCs.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "As far as we know, this research is the first attempt to draw
      attention to the existence of different prompt types in SRL in MOOCs."
      (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication by other authors in a
      different context, published in a peer-reviewed outlet. The paper does
      not report any such replication, and it explicitly frames itself as a
      first attempt in this specific direction. A web search for replication
      studies of this exact RCT (by title, DOI, and authors) did not identify
      any published independent replication as of the ERCT check date.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is not met because no independent
      replication study of this specific trial could be found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: Because E is not met, A is automatically not met.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A final multiple-choice test, upon successful completion, granted
      learners a certificate of advanced training." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardised exam-based measurement across all core
      subjects, and it depends on Criterion E being met. The only achievement
      assessment here is a course-specific final test within a single MOOC, not
      standardised exams across subjects. Since Criterion E is not met, Criterion
      A is not met by definition.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because criterion E is
      not met and the study does not measure standardised outcomes across all
      core subjects.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: Because Y is not met, G is automatically not met; no evidence
      of graduation tracking was found.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "First, the intervention was brief and limited to short text-based
      prompts within a short-duration course." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation, and ERCT
      rules state that if Criterion Y is not met, Criterion G is not met. This
      study is a short MOOC intervention with outcomes tied to course activity
      and a final course test, and the paper provides no evidence of long-term
      follow-up to any graduation milestone. A web search for follow-up papers
      by the same authors reporting graduation tracking for this cohort did not
      identify any such publication as of the ERCT check date.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is not met because criterion Y is
      not met and no graduation tracking (in this paper or identifiable follow-
      up papers) is documented.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: The paper provides an OSF link for data and code, but it does
      not report a pre-registered protocol with a pre-data-collection date.
    quote: >-
      The data, R code for the analysis and tables with the results of
      regression models are available via the link:
      https://osf.io/49vpe/?view_only=594109bdac6544d29900cf4561f6be85

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The data, R code for the analysis and tables with the results of
      regression models are available via the link:
      https://osf.io/49vpe/?view_only=594109bdac6544d29900cf4561f6be85"
      (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires a pre-registered study protocol (hypotheses, methods,
      planned analyses) registered before data collection begins, with evidence
      of timing. The paper does not state that the study was pre-registered, does
      not provide a registry identifier (for example, OSF registration/registry
      entry, AEA RCT registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN), and provides no
      registration date relative to study start. The only transparency link is
      to “data” and “R code,” which is not sufficient evidence of pre-
      registration. Attempts to verify a corresponding pre-registration entry
      via web search did not yield a clearly identifiable pre-registered protocol
      for this study with a pre-study date.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is not met because there is no
      documented pre-registered protocol with verifiable registration timing
      before data collection.
