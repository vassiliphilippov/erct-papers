  Background: Collaborative learning is one of the important interactive
  teaching methods in teaching nursing practices. This study aimed to examine
  the impact of the collaborative learning approach on nursing students’
  knowledge levels and self-directed learning skills related to enteral
  nutrition.

  Method: This research employed an open-label, randomized controlled design
  with pre-test and post-test measurements. The study sample comprised 90
  first-year nursing students who were randomly assigned to the experimental
  (n = 45) and control (n = 45) groups. In the study, data were collected
  using the ‘Descriptive Characteristics Form for the Student Group,’
  ‘Knowledge Test on Enteral Nutrition,’ and ‘Self-Directed Learning Skills
  Scale.’ Students worked in five separate groups on topics related to enteral
  nutrition, and afterward, group representatives shared information with all
  groups. The study was registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov system on the
  date the students began the study and was assigned the registration number
  NCT06412835.

  Results: It was determined that the final test and follow-up test knowledge
  scores of the experimental group were statistically significantly higher
  than those of the control group (p = 0.007; p<0.001). Additionally, a
  statistically significant difference was found in all measurements of the
  final test scores of the experimental group's self-directed learning skills
  scale (p<0.001). When the subscales of the self-directed learning skills
  scale were analyzed, statistically significant differences and a strong
  effect were found between the pre-test and final test scores of the
  experimental group in self-monitoring (p<0.001; d=4.502), motivation
  (p<0.001; d=5.398), self-control (p<0.001; d=3.700), and confidence
  (p<0.001; d=6.034).

  Conclusion: The fact that the student’s self-directed learning skills scale
  sub-dimensions (self-monitoring, motivation, self-control and confidence)
  are significantly higher shows that instructors should integrate the
  collaborative learning method into the education system to learn the right
  knowledge and skills. The use of collaborative learning methods is
  recommended for all newly acquired skills in nursing education, as is the
  case with enteral nutrition.

    explanation: >-
      Randomization was at the individual student level rather than at the
      class (or school) level, and the intervention was not one-to-one
      tutoring.
    quote: >-
      "Participants were assigned to the experimental and control groups by
      the researcher using an online randomization software
      (https://www.randomizer.org/)." (PDF p. 7)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study population comprised 116 students enrolled in the
      Fundamentals of Nursing Course II during the spring term of the 2023–
      2024 academic year in the nursing department of a university’s Faculty
      of Health Sciences." (PDF p. 6)

      2) "A total of 90 students who agreed to participate in the study and
      completed the “Student Group Characteristics Form,” “Enteral Nutrition
      Knowledge Test,” and “Self-Directed Learning Skills Scale” were included
      in the research." (PDF p. 7)

      3) "Participants were assigned to the experimental and control groups by
      the researcher using an online randomization software
      (https://www.randomizer.org/)." (PDF p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion C requires randomization at the class level (or stronger,
      e.g., school/site level) to reduce contamination, unless the intervention
      is explicitly one-to-one tutoring/personal teaching.

      The paper describes a single university course cohort and states that
      participants (students) were assigned by the researcher using an online
      randomizer. There is no indication that intact classes/sections or
      schools/sites were randomized.

      The intervention (collaborative learning / Jigsaw technique) is a group-
      based classroom method rather than one-to-one tutoring, so the tutoring
      exception does not apply.

      Final: Criterion C is not met because the unit of randomization was
      individual students rather than classes (or schools), with no tutoring
      exception.

      The main learning outcome was measured using a researcher-prepared
      knowledge test rather than a widely recognized standardized exam.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Knowledge Test on Enteral Nutrition: The relevant test was prepared
      by the researchers by reviewing the literature [2,5,7]." (PDF p. 7)

      2) "In this study, the knowledge test and descriptive characteristics
      form belonging to the students were used only in this study. They were
      created by the researchers." (PDF p. 20)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion E requires exam-based assessment using standardized, widely
      recognized tests (e.g., national/state exams or established standardized
      achievement measures). The key question is whether the academic outcome
      measure is a standardized external exam versus a bespoke instrument.

      The paper explicitly states the enteral nutrition knowledge test was
      prepared/created by the researchers and used only in this study, which
      indicates a custom instrument rather than a standardized exam.

      Although the study also uses a published "Self-Directed Learning Skills
      Scale", that scale is not an external standardized exam of educational
      achievement in the sense required by ERCT criterion E.

      Final: Criterion E is not met because the primary knowledge outcome was
      measured with a researcher-created test, not a standardized exam.
  t:

      Outcomes were measured over roughly 6 weeks from the start of the study,
      which is shorter than one academic term.

      3) "To measure the retention of the knowledge level, the same test was
      applied again 4 weeks after the post-test (28 June 2024)." (PDF p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion T requires outcome measurement at least one full academic
      term (typically ~3–4 months) after the intervention begins.

      The paper gives explicit dates showing the study ran from 15 May 2024 to
      28 June 2024, with a post-test on 31 May 2024 and a follow-up test on
      28 June 2024. Even using the final follow-up test, the elapsed time from
      the study start is about 6 weeks, which is well below a term.

      Final: Criterion T is not met because the longest reported follow-up is
      only about 6 weeks after the start, not a full academic term.

      3) "Table 2 Pre-test, post-test and follow-up test knowledge scores of
      students in the control and experimental groups" (PDF p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion D requires a well-documented control group, including (a)
      what the control received and (b) baseline information enabling
      comparisons (e.g., demographics and baseline performance).

      The paper provides a concrete description of the control condition and
      time components (theory, skill demonstration, and hands-on lab training).
      It also reports baseline demographic comparability (Table 1 statement)
      and presents baseline (pre-test) and subsequent knowledge outcomes for
      both groups (Table 2).

      Final: Criterion D is met because the control condition and baseline
      characteristics/performance are described and reported in the paper.

      2) "Participants were assigned to the experimental and control groups by
      the researcher using an online randomization software
      (https://www.randomizer.org/)." (PDF p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion S requires school-level (site/institution-level)
      randomization, meaning multiple schools/sites are randomized to
      intervention vs control.

      The paper describes a single university course cohort and indicates
      allocation of participants (students) into two groups by the researcher.
      There is no description of multiple schools/sites or school-level
      assignment.

      Final: Criterion S is not met because assignment occurred at the student
      level within a single institution, not at the school/site level.

      3) "Aysun ACUN and Rahime AKSOY BULGURCU conducted the survey, data
      collection, and visualization." (PDF p. 20)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion I requires independent conduct, meaning the evaluation is
      performed by a third party independent of the intervention designers,
      reducing risks of implementation and measurement bias.

      The paper indicates the researcher performed allocation, and the author
      contribution statement indicates the authors conducted data collection
      and analysis. No external evaluation team, independent test
      administrators, or independent oversight is described.

      Final: Criterion I is not met because the study conduct and evaluation
      are attributed to the author team rather than an independent evaluator.

      applied again 4 weeks after the post-test (28 June 2024)." (PDF p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least 75% of one
      academic year after the intervention begins. Per the ERCT rules provided
      for this task, if criterion T is not met then criterion Y is not met.

      The dates show the entire study window runs from mid-May to late June
      2024 (about 6 weeks), with the longest stated follow-up being a 4-week
      retention test.

      Final: Criterion Y is not met because the study duration is only weeks
      (and criterion T is not met).

      2) "After the pre-test was administered, the theoretical lectures were
      given as three separate lectures within the scope of 45-minute lecture
      periods in the classroom environment (15 May 2024)." (PDF p. 9)

      3) "This session was conducted in laboratory conditions, lasting a total
      of 14 hours over four consecutive days (first, second, and third days: 4
      hours; fourth day: 2 hours), with each class lasting 45 minutes."
      (PDF p. 10)

      4) "With the control group of students, standard course procedures were
      followed. After the pre-test, students received 4 hours of theory, 2
      hours of skill demonstration, and 16 hours of hands-on laboratory
      training on nutritional needs related to enteral nutrition. The control
      group also spent 14 hours practicing skills in the laboratory." (PDF p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion B asks whether the intervention and control conditions are
      balanced in time and resources, unless additional resources are the
      explicit treatment variable.

      Here, the intervention is a different pedagogy (collaborative learning /
      Jigsaw technique) rather than an explicit "more time/more money" resource
      intervention. The paper describes substantial time commitments for both
      arms, including extensive lab practice for both groups (14 hours for the
      experimental lab session and 14 hours of lab practice for the control
      group), and additional structured teaching components in the control
      arm.

      The experimental arm includes additional elements (e.g., small-group
      preparation and between-group sharing) but the paper does not quantify
      these as extra instructional hours beyond the described sessions in a
      way that clearly indicates an unbalanced addition of time/budget.

      Final: Criterion B is met because the paper does not provide evidence
      that the intervention group received a clear, non-integral increase in
      time/budget/resources unmatched by the control condition.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) (No statement in the paper indicates this study has been independently
      replicated by another research team.)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion R requires an independent replication by a different
      research team in a different context, published in a peer-reviewed
      journal.

      The article presents a single RCT conducted in one university setting
      and does not describe any replication. An internet search (performed
      on 2026-02-14) for the DOI/title and for papers explicitly describing a
      replication did not identify a distinct peer-reviewed replication study
      by a different author team.

      Final: Criterion R is not met because no independent replication was
      identified or evidenced in the paper or in post-publication searches.

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all
      main subjects, and per the ERCT rules provided for this task, if
      criterion E is not met then criterion A is not met.

      This study uses a researcher-prepared enteral nutrition knowledge test
      rather than standardized exams, and it does not assess broad multi-
      subject academic outcomes.

      Final: Criterion A is not met because criterion E is not met and the
      study does not use standardized all-subject exams.

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion G requires follow-up tracking until participants’
      graduation from the relevant educational stage. Per the ERCT rules
      provided for this task, if criterion Y is not met then criterion G is
      not met.

      The paper describes a short-term follow-up only (a 4-week retention
      test) and provides no statement about longer-term tracking to end-of-
      program completion or graduation. An internet search (performed on
      2026-02-14) did not identify a follow-up publication by the same authors
      reporting graduation tracking for this cohort.

      Final: Criterion G is not met because follow-up ends within weeks and no
      graduation tracking evidence was found.

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion P requires that the study protocol be registered before
      the study begins (i.e., before data collection / first participant
      enrollment as defined by the registry and the paper’s timeline).

      The paper provides a ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT06412835). The
      registry record (as mirrored by ICHGCP) reports "First Submitted  May 3,
      2024" and "Study Start (Actual)  May 8, 2024", indicating registration
      submission occurred before the study start date. The paper’s own stated
      study window begins later (15 May 2024), which is also after the
      submission date.

      Final: Criterion P is met because registry dates indicate registration
      submission before the study start date.
