abstract: >-
  Active music and movement engagement has been widely integrated in
  human socialization across history and cultures, and is particularly
  prevalent in early childhood play and learning. For clinical
  populations, music therapy is known to support social skills and
  wellbeing for young children. However, there is less evidence for the
  value of active music engagement for non-clinical populations in terms
  of supporting social and behavioral wellbeing in the early years. This
  study reports results from the Rhythm and Movement for Self-Regulation
  (RAMSR) program delivered by generalist kindergarten teachers in low
  socioeconomic communities. This randomized control trial involved 213
  children across eight preschools in disadvantaged communities in
  Queensland, Australia. The intervention group received 16 to 20
  sessions of RAMSR over eight weeks, while the control group undertook
  usual preschool programs. Data was collected through teacher report at
  pre and post intervention, and again six months later once children
  had transitioned into their first year of school. Robust mixed models
  accounting for repeated measures and clustering of children within
  kindergartens (random effects), evidenced significant intervention
  effects across the three time points for improved prosocial skills
  (p = 0.04, np2 = 0.02), and reduced externalizing (p < 0.01,
  np2 = 0.03) and internalizing behavior problems (p = 0.04;
  np2 = 0.02), with small to moderate effect sizes. These findings
  highlight the valuable role that intentional active music engagement
  in universal settings such as preschool can play in terms of social
  and behavioral wellbeing.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Randomization occurred at the kindergarten-center (cluster) level,
      which meets or exceeds the class-level randomization requirement.
    quote: >-
      "This research employed a clustered randomized control trial..."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This research employed a clustered randomized control trial
      with approval from the Queensland University of Technology Human
      Research Ethics Committee (approval number 1900000566), and is
      registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials
      Registry, ACTRN12619001342101."

      2) "In brief, this study involved eight kindergarten centers in
      Queensland, Australia (the year before formal schooling in this
      jurisdiction). Eight centers were randomized to achieve adequate
      statistical power at the cluster level while preserving a
      balanced and feasible design."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires random assignment at the class level (or a
      stronger unit, such as school/center) to reduce contamination
      between treatment and control students sharing the same classroom
      context.

      The paper explicitly describes a "clustered randomized control
      trial" and states that "eight kindergarten centers were
      randomized," indicating the unit of randomization is the center
      (a level above individual classrooms and students).

      This meets (and exceeds) class-level randomization because entire
      centers were assigned to conditions rather than mixing treatment
      and control children within the same class.

      Final Summary: Criterion C is met because the study randomized at
      the kindergarten-center (cluster) level.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured via teacher-report questionnaires rather
      than standardized exam-based assessments.
    quote: >-
      "Data was collected through teacher report at pre and post
      intervention..."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Data was collected through teacher report at pre and post
      intervention, and again six months later once children had
      transitioned into their first year of school."

      2) "We used four subscales from the Child Self-Regulation and
      Behavior Questionnaire (CSBQ) (Howard & Melhuish, 2017) which is
      an educator report requiring the respondent to evaluate the
      general frequency of target behaviors on a scale of 1 (not true)
      to 5 (certainly true)."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized exam-based assessments (i.e.,
      widely recognized standardized academic tests) as the primary
      outcome measurement approach.

      The study reports that data were collected via teacher report,
      and the Measures section specifies educator-report questionnaire
      subscales (CSBQ). These are not standardized academic exams.

      Final Summary: Criterion E is not met because outcomes are based
      on teacher-report rating scales rather than standardized exams.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured at least six months after baseline, which
      exceeds one academic term from intervention commencement to the
      latest follow-up measurement.
    quote: >-
      "A further six-month follow-up (T3) occurred after children
      transitioned to their first year of school, known locally as
      Prep."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The intervention group received 16 to 20 sessions of RAMSR
      over eight weeks, while the control group undertook usual
      preschool programs."

      2) "Baseline assessments (T1) were conducted, followed by
      reassessment six months later, immediately after participation in
      the intervention (n = 4 centers) or the control condition
      (n = 4 centers). A further six-month follow-up (T3) occurred
      after children transitioned to their first year of school, known
      locally as Prep."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that outcomes are measured at least one full
      academic term (typically about 3 to 4 months) after the
      intervention begins, to avoid relying only on immediate
      post-intervention outcomes.

      The paper reports measurement at baseline (T1), then again six
      months later (T2), and then a further six-month follow-up (T3).
      Regardless of the intervention's eight-week delivery window, the
      existence of a follow-up timepoint six months after the prior
      assessment implies at least term-length tracking beyond the start
      of the intervention program and its initial delivery period.

      Final Summary: Criterion T is met because the study includes
      follow-up outcome measurement well beyond one academic term.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The paper documents the control condition and provides control
      group sample size and demographics.
    quote: >-
      "The intervention group received 16 to 20 sessions of RAMSR over
      eight weeks, while the control group undertook usual preschool

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The intervention group received 16 to 20 sessions of RAMSR
      over eight weeks, while the control group undertook usual
      preschool programs."

      2) "Table 1. Demographic data for intervention and control groups.
      Whole Sample N = 213 Intervention (n = 112, 53%) Control
      (n = 101, 47%)."

      3) "Teachers in the control condition were provided with a one-off
      webinar recording of professional learning related to children’s
      self-regulation development, and were provided with the full
      RAMSR training following completion of the study."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires a clearly described control group, including
      what the control group did (or did not) receive and enough
      information to understand comparability (e.g., sizes and
      characteristics).

      The paper states the control group undertook "usual preschool
      programs" and further specifies an active element for control
      teachers (a one-off webinar). It also provides group sizes and
      demographic data in Table 1.

      Final Summary: Criterion D is met because the control condition is
      clearly described and baseline group information is reported.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Entire kindergarten centers (sites) were randomized, satisfying
      the school-level RCT requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In brief, this study involved eight kindergarten centers in
      Queensland, Australia (the year before formal schooling in this
      jurisdiction). Eight centers were randomized to achieve adequate
      statistical power at the cluster level while preserving a
      balanced and feasible design."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the school/site/center
      level (the institutional unit implementing the intervention).

      The paper explicitly states that eight kindergarten centers were
      randomized, which is randomization at the site/center level.

      Final Summary: Criterion S is met because randomization occurred
      at the kindergarten-center level.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper does not clearly document that the evaluation was
      conducted independently from the intervention's designers.

      K.E.W.; formal analysis, L.B.; ..."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "RAMSR is a result of the collaboration between music
      therapists, music specialists and early childhood educators who
      aimed to draw together evidence and practice from music
      psychology, formal music education, and clinical music therapy to
      design an intervention that can be implemented by any adult
      working with children aged 3 to 8 years (Williams, 2018)."

      2) "Author Contributions: Conceptualization, K.E.W.; methodology,
      K.E.W.; formal analysis, L.B.; resources, K.E.W.; data curation,
      L.B.; writing—original draft preparation, K.E.W. and L.B.; writing—
      review and editing, K.E.W. and L.B.; supervision, K.E.W.; project
      administration, L.B.; funding acquisition, K.E.W."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires evidence that study conduct and evaluation
      are independent from the intervention designers/providers to
      reduce risk of bias.

      The paper describes RAMSR as a designed intervention and the
      author-contributions statement shows the authors led core study
      functions (conceptualization, methodology, resources, supervision,
      and analysis). The paper does not include a clear statement that
      an external/independent evaluation team led data collection or
      analysis independent of the intervention designers.

      Final Summary: Criterion I is not met because independent conduct
      of the evaluation is not clearly documented.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study includes measurements spanning baseline and two later
      timepoints totaling about 12 months, meeting the year-duration
      requirement.
    quote: >-
      "Baseline assessments (T1) were conducted, followed by
      reassessment six months later... A further six-month follow-up
      (T3) occurred..."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Baseline assessments (T1) were conducted, followed by
      reassessment six months later, immediately after participation in
      the intervention (n = 4 centers) or the control condition
      (n = 4 centers). A further six-month follow-up (T3) occurred
      after children transitioned to their first year of school, known
      locally as Prep."

      2) "Children typically begin their kindergarten year at
      approximately 3.5–4.5 attending for 12 months prior to formal
      schooling, with sessions scheduled for four to five days per
      fortnight."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement for at least 75% of an
      academic year after the intervention begins (commonly about 9 to
      10 months, depending on context).

      The paper describes baseline (T1), a six-month later assessment
      (T2), and a further six-month follow-up (T3), implying about 12
      months from baseline to the final follow-up. This exceeds 75% of
      a typical academic year and is consistent with tracking across
      the transition-to-school period.

      Final Summary: Criterion Y is met because the study reports
      approximately 12 months of tracking across T1 to T3.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Although the intervention required additional teacher training and
      materials, these appear integral to the intervention package and
      child sessions were embedded in the regular schedule.
    quote: >-
      "The intervention was integrated into the regular kindergarten
      schedule, typically during circle time at the start of the day."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Training consisted of a one-day workshop followed by
      fortnightly on-site coaching. Teachers were provided with all
      session plans, audio tracks, and instructional videos
      demonstrating the activities."

      2) "The intervention was integrated into the regular kindergarten
      schedule, typically during circle time at the start of the day."

      3) "Teachers in the control condition were provided with a one-off
      webinar recording of professional learning related to children’s
      self-regulation development, and were provided with the full
      RAMSR training following completion of the study."

      4) "The intervention group received 16 to 20 sessions of RAMSR
      over eight weeks, while the control group undertook usual
      preschool programs."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B compares the nature, quantity, and quality of
      resources (time, materials, adult support, training) provided to
      intervention and control groups, and asks whether any resource
      differences confound the treatment effect, unless the added
      resources are integral to what is being tested.

      Extra resources are clearly present for intervention teachers
      (workshop, ongoing coaching, and provision of materials). The
      control teachers received a smaller professional learning input
      (a one-off webinar) and were offered full training after study
      completion.

      Critically, the child-facing RAMSR sessions were "integrated into
      the regular kindergarten schedule," which indicates the program
      likely substituted for regular circle-time activities rather than
      adding additional instructional time beyond the normal day. The
      teacher training/materials appear to be integral components of
      the RAMSR delivery model, not an incidental add-on separable from
      the intervention definition.

      Final Summary: Criterion B is met because added supports are
      integral to the intervention package and the child-facing time is
      embedded within regular schedule time.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No peer-reviewed independent replication of this specific trial's
      findings was found or documented.
    quote: >-
      "Finally, the extent to which the findings presented here might
      be replicated outside of the local Australian context in which
      the program was developed and tested is yet to be determined."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Finally, the extent to which the findings presented here
      might be replicated outside of the local Australian context in
      which the program was developed and tested is yet to be
      determined."

      2) "A trial of an adapted version of the program has been
      completed in Hong Kong with results not yet published."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication by a different
      research team in a different context, published in a peer-
      reviewed outlet.

      The paper itself states replication outside the local context is
      "yet to be determined" and notes the Hong Kong trial results are
      "not yet published," which is consistent with the absence of an
      available peer-reviewed replication at the time of this paper.

      Additional internet searching for peer-reviewed RCT publications
      by independent teams reporting replication of these outcomes did
      not identify a published independent replication paper.

      Final Summary: Criterion R is not met because an independent,
      peer-reviewed replication of this study was not found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Because Criterion E is not met, the all-subject standardized exam
      requirement cannot be met.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Data was collected through teacher report at pre and post
      intervention, and again six months later once children had
      transitioned into their first year of school."

      2) "We used four subscales from the Child Self-Regulation and
      Behavior Questionnaire (CSBQ) (Howard & Melhuish, 2017) which is
      an educator report..."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all
      main subjects and depends on Criterion E being satisfied.

      This study uses teacher-report behavioral/social-emotional scales
      rather than standardized academic exams, so it cannot satisfy
      Criterion E and therefore cannot satisfy Criterion A.

      Final Summary: Criterion A is not met because standardized exams
      are not used (Criterion E is not met).
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study follows children only through the transition into the
      first year of school and does not track participants until
      graduation.

      2) "A further six-month follow-up (T3) occurred after children
      transitioned to their first year of school, known locally as
      Prep."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires that participants are followed until
      graduation (from the relevant educational stage) to assess
      long-term impacts.

      The paper reports follow-up into the first year of formal school
      ("Prep") with a six-month follow-up, which is meaningful but far
      short of tracking until graduation (e.g., end of primary school or
      later). Internet searching for later follow-up publications by
      the same authors tracking this cohort through graduation did not
      identify such a publication.

      Final Summary: Criterion G is not met because graduation outcomes
      are not tracked and no graduation follow-up paper was found.
  p:
    met: true

      From the paper:

      1) "This research employed a clustered randomized control trial
      with approval from the Queensland University of Technology Human
      Research Ethics Committee (approval number 1900000566), and is

      3) "Date registered 30/09/2019"

      4) "Type of registration Prospectively registered"

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the study protocol is pre-registered
      before data collection begins, with verifiable timing (registration
      date earlier than recruitment/data collection start).

      The paper provides the registry identifier (ACTRN12619001342101)
      and indicates child recruitment occurred "at the start of 2020."
      The ANZCTR record states the trial was "Prospectively registered"
      with "Date registered 30/09/2019," which is before the stated
      recruitment timing.

      Final Summary: Criterion P is met because the trial was
      prospectively registered on 30/09/2019 before recruitment began in
      early 2020.

## Change summary (what was updated)

1) Added missing metadata:
   - Set `paper_link` to the DOI landing page.
   - Set `pdf_link` to a direct, downloadable PDF link.
   - Set `date_erct_check` to **2026-02-21**.

2) Quote verification and formatting:
   - Removed incorrect line-break hyphenations (e.g., "coach- ing",
     "participa- tion") so quotes match the paper text.
   - Rewrote every criterion `analysis` field to the required structure:
     **Relevant Quotes → Detailed Analysis → Final Summary**.

3) Criteria re-checks requiring internet access:
   - **P (Pre-registered)** updated from **not met** to **met** based on
     the ANZCTR record showing **prospective registration on 30/09/2019**
     and recruitment starting at the beginning of 2020.
   - **R (Reproduced)** remained **not met** after searching for an
     independent peer-reviewed replication; none was found.
   - **G (Graduation tracking)** remained **not met** after searching for
     later follow-up papers tracking the cohort through graduation; none
     was found.

4) ERCT level:
   - Confirmed `erct_level` remains **0** because Criterion **E** is not
     met (teacher-report measures rather than standardized exams), so
     Level 1 requirements are not fully satisfied.
