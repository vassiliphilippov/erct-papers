abstract: >-
  This paper presents results from a randomized evaluation of a bundled program
  employing an external coordinator to aid 4th grade teachers with the
  integration of a math learning platform that partially replaced regular school
  math instruction in Chile. Students in treatment classrooms experienced
  sizable gains in math achievement, scoring 0.27 standard deviations more than
  control students as measured in the national standardized exam. The program
  increased students' preference for using technology in math instruction and
  students beliefs regarding the malleability of intelligence, while reducing
  preferences for teamwork. These findings suggest that the integration of the
  use of learning platforms during the regular school time can produce large
  gains in academic achievement and influence non-academic outcomes in
  developing countries.

  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study randomized at the section (class) level within schools, which
      meets the requirement for class-level randomization.
    quote: >-
      "We randomly assigned one fourth-grade section within each of these
      schools to the treatment group and assigned the other section in that
      grade to the control group."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We randomly assigned one fourth-grade section within each of these
      schools to the treatment group and assigned the other section in that
      [cite_start]grade to the control group." [cite: 59]

      2) "We adopted a within-school, section-level randomization design."
      [cite_start][cite: 244]

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires that randomization be conducted at the class level
      (or higher, i.e., school level) to prevent contamination within the
      classroom. The authors explicitly state that they randomized "sections"
      (classrooms) within each school, assigning one to treatment and one to
      [cite_start]control[cite: 59, 244]. This ensures that the unit of randomization is
      the class, fulfilling the criterion.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met because randomization was
      performed at the section (class) level.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study used the SIMCE, which is the Chilean national standardized
      exam.
    quote: >-
      "Our primary outcome measuring math learning was obtained from the
      Chilean national standardized exam administered in November 2017"
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Our primary outcome measuring math learning was obtained from the
      Chilean national standardized exam administered in November 2017"
      [cite_start][cite: 63]

      2) "This is a paper-based assessment implemented yearly in all schools in
      the country to monitor math and language learning in fourth grade."
      [cite_start][cite: 64]

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires the use of widely recognized standardized exams
      rather than custom-made tests. The study utilizes the SIMCE ("Sistema de
      Medición de la Calidad de la Educación"), which is the national
      [cite_start]standardized exam in Chile[cite: 63, 233]. This explicitly meets the
      requirement for a standard, widely recognized test.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is met because the primary
      outcome was measured using the national standardized SIMCE exam.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention lasted approximately seven months, which exceeds the
      minimum one-term duration requirement.
    quote: >-
      "The program was implemented immediately thereafter and ran until
      November 2017... (after seven months of program exposure)."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Baseline data were collected in March 2017; the program was
      implemented immediately thereafter and ran until November 2017"
      [cite_start][cite: 61]

      2) "Our primary outcome measuring math learning was obtained from the
      Chilean national standardized exam administered in November 2017 (after
      [cite_start]seven months of program exposure)." [cite: 63]

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires outcomes to be measured at least one full academic
      term (typically 3-4 months) after the intervention begins. This study
      [cite_start]ran from March to November 2017, a duration of seven months[cite: 61,
      63]. This period is significantly longer than one academic term.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met because the intervention
      duration of seven months exceeds the one-term minimum.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control group is clearly documented with demographic data and a
      description of their "business as usual" condition.
    quote: >-
      "The other sections were assigned to the control group, which did not
      have access to sessions with the learning platform and received
      traditional math instruction."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The other sections were assigned to the control group, which did not
      have access to sessions with the learning platform and received
      [cite_start]traditional math instruction." [cite: 245]

      2) "Table 2... presents descriptive statistics for baseline
      characteristics for the treatment and control groups... Treatment and
      [cite_start]control groups are well balanced at baseline." [cite: 318-319]

      3) "47 % of students in the control group are girls, 99% attended
      [cite_start]kindergarten..." [cite: 321]

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires detailed documentation of the control group's
      characteristics and conditions. The paper provides a specific description
      of the control condition ("traditional math instruction" with no platform
      [cite_start]access)[cite: 245]. Furthermore, Table 2 and the text provide explicit
      demographic statistics for the control group (gender, kindergarten
      [cite_start]attendance, etc.) and confirm balance[cite: 318, 321].

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because the control group
      conditions and baseline characteristics are thoroughly documented.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization was performed at the section (class) level within schools,
      not at the school level.
    quote: >-
      "We adopted a within-school, section-level randomization design. Within
      each of the 24 participating schools, we randomly assigned one of the two
      fourth-grade sections to the treatment group."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We adopted a within-school, section-level randomization design.
      Within each of the 24 participating schools, we randomly assigned one of
      [cite_start]the two fourth-grade sections to the treatment group." [cite: 244]

      2) "We randomly assigned one fourth-grade section within each of these
      [cite_start]schools to the treatment group..." [cite: 59]

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires randomization to occur at the school level (among
      schools) to reflect real-world implementation and avoid spillover. This
      study explicitly utilized a "within-school" design where randomization
      [cite_start]occurred at the section (class) level, not the school level[cite: 244].
      Therefore, the stronger school-level requirement is not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is not met because the study
      used class-level randomization within schools rather than randomizing
      entire schools.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study was not conducted independently; the lead author developed the
      program and the author team managed the implementation.
    quote: >-
      "The program employed a learning platform called Conectaldeas developed
      by a team at the Center for Advanced Research on Education of the
      Universidad de Chile."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The program employed a learning platform called Conectaldeas
      developed by a team at the Center for Advanced Research on Education of
      [cite_start]the Universidad de Chile." [cite: 161]

      2) "Roberto Araya, Elena Arias Ortiz, Nicolas Bottan, Julian Cristia...
      [cite_start]Institute of Education, Universidad de Chile" [cite: 8-9]

      3) "Roberto Araya thanks... funds... and is grateful for initial funding...
      [cite_start]that supported development of the program." [cite: 40]

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires the study to be conducted independently from the
      designers of the intervention. The first author, Roberto Araya, is
      affiliated with the institution that developed the platform and is
      [cite_start]thanked for funding regarding the "development of the program"[cite: 40,
      161]. The paper does not state that the evaluation was conducted by an
      independent third party; rather, the authors themselves conducted the
      study.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is not met because the lead
      author was involved in the development of the intervention being tested.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention duration was seven months, which is less than the full
      academic year (typically 9-10 months) required by the criterion.
    quote: >-
      "Our primary outcome measuring math learning was obtained... after seven
      months of program exposure"
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The program ran from March to November 2017 (the school year in
      [cite_start]Chile takes place from March to December)." [cite: 61]

      2) "Our primary outcome measuring math learning was obtained from the
      Chilean national standardized exam administered in November 2017 (after
      [cite_start]seven months of program exposure)." [cite: 63]

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires outcomes to be measured at least one full academic
      year (typically 9-10 months) after the start. The study explicitly states
      the school year runs from March to December, but the program and
      measurement concluded in November after "seven months of program
      [cite_start]exposure"[cite: 61, 63]. Seven months falls short of the full academic
      year requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is not met because the study
      duration was seven months, which is shorter than a full academic year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The extra time and resources were an integral part of the "bundled"
      intervention explicitly being tested against business-as-usual, satisfying
      the exception for this criterion.
    quote: >-
      "Because of the bundled nature of the program, we cannot assess the
      contribution of each feature on the overall effect reported."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The program evaluated packs several features including: ... (iii) 90
      min of additional math instruction... (ii) sessions conducted by external
      [cite_start]coordinators" [cite: 55]

      2) "Because of the bundled nature of the program, we cannot assess the
      contribution of each feature on the overall effect reported. Still,
      identifying effective packages... is relevant for policy purposes."
      [cite_start][cite: 56-57]

      3) "The control group... did not have access to sessions with the
      [cite_start]learning platform and received traditional math instruction." [cite: 245]

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention group received significant additional resources,
      specifically 90 minutes of extra math instruction per week and an
      [cite_start]external coordinator[cite: 55], while the control group received only
      [cite_start]traditional instruction[cite: 245]. Normally, this imbalance would fail
      the criterion. However, the authors explicitly define the intervention as
      a "bundled program" and state that the intent is to evaluate this package
      [cite_start][cite: 55-57]. Under the ERCT standard exception, if the additional
      resources are the primary treatment variable (part of the bundle), the
      control group may remain "business as usual."

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met because the extra
      instructional time was an integral part of the bundled intervention being
      tested.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      There is no evidence provided of an independent replication of this study
      by a different research team.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We also study the early implementation of Conectaldeas... from 2011
      [cite_start]until 2016... non-experimental estimates." [cite: 530]

      2) "Araya (2018) evaluated Conectaldeas using a before and after
      [cite_start]approach..." [cite: 540]

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires the study to be independently replicated by a
      different research team. While the paper discusses previous
      implementations (2011-2016), these were analyzed by the same authors or
      [cite_start]related teams (Araya)[cite: 530, 540]. There is no citation or mention
      of an independent reproduction of the study results by an external group
      in the provided text.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is not met because no
      independent replication by a different research team is cited.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study assessed Math and Language but did not assess Science, which is
      stated as a subject taught by the teachers.
    quote: >-
      "Each teacher is assigned one classroom and they teach all academic
      subjects such as Math, Language, and Science."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Each teacher is assigned one classroom and they teach all academic
      [cite_start]subjects such as Math, Language, and Science." [cite: 156]

      2) "Our primary outcome measuring math learning was obtained from the
      Chilean national standardized exam... Effects on language were also
      [cite_start]analyzed to explore potential spillovers." [cite: 305]

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires the study to measure the impact on all main
      subjects taught. The paper explicitly states that teachers teach "Math,
      [cite_start]Language, and Science"[cite: 156]. However, the study only measures
      [cite_start]outcomes for Math and Language[cite: 305]. By excluding Science, the
      study fails to assess potential negative impacts on all main subjects.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because Science, a
      main subject taught, was not assessed.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study tracked students only until the end of the intervention period
      (Grade 4), not until graduation.
    quote: >-
      "The RCT ended at that point." (implied by lack of follow-up description)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Our primary outcome... was obtained from the Chilean national
      [cite_start]standardized exam administered in November 2017" [cite: 63]

      2) "There were no significant spillover effects... [analysis ends with
      [cite_start]exam data]" [cite: 521]

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires tracking participants until their graduation to
      assess long-term impacts. The provided text indicates that measurement
      [cite_start]occurred at the end of the program (November 2017)[cite: 63], with no
      mention of tracking the students through the end of their primary
      education or graduation.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is not met because there is no
      evidence of student tracking beyond the immediate intervention year.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      There is no evidence in the text that the study protocol was
      pre-registered before data collection began.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This project was funded by the IDRC... and the IADB. Cornell IRB#0,147,331."
      [cite_start][cite: 43]

      [cite_start]2) "Baseline data were collected in March 2017..." [cite: 61]

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires the full study protocol to be pre-registered before
      data collection. [cite_start]The paper mentions funding and IRB approval[cite: 43],
      but there is no mention of a pre-registration on a public registry (like
      AEA RCT Registry or ClinicalTrials.gov) or a registration date prior to
      [cite_start]the March 2017 start date[cite: 61].

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is not met because no
      pre-registration details are provided.
