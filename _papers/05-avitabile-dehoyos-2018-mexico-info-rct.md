abstract: >-
  We use data from the randomized control trial of the
  Percepciones pilot to study whether providing 10th grade students
  with information about
  the average earnings associated with different
  educational attainments, life expectancy, and obtaining funding for
  higher education can contribute to improving student outcomes.
  We find that the intervention had no effects on a proxy for
  on-time high school completion, but a positive and significant
  impact on standardized test scores and self-reported measures of
  effort.
  The effects on standardized test scores are larger for girls
  and for students from households with relatively high incomes.
  We also find positive, but not statistically significant effects,
  on the probability of taking a university entry exam and of
  obtaining a high score in the exam.

      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "Following a two-step stratified sampling by regions (north,
      center, and south), the 54 schools were randomly divided into 26
      treatment schools and 28 control schools." (p. 4)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The study clearly states that entire schools were the unit of
      randomisation. School-level randomisation exceeds the requirement
      for class‑level RCT, satisfying the criterion by design.
      
      Final sentence: The study randomizes at the school level, meeting
      the Class‑level RCT criterion.

      1) "Using 2012 and 2013 administrative data from the 12th grade
      census-based nationally standardized ENLACE exam and the
      university entry exam EXANI‑II ..." (p. 2)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The authors employ ENLACE, a national standardized test, as the
      main outcome measure. This exam is widely recognised and
      comparable across contexts, satisfying the requirement for a
      standard exam‑based assessment.
      
      Final sentence: The use of the ENLACE standardized exam meets
      the Exam‑based Assessment criterion.

      The study uses the nationally standardized ENLACE exam for
      objective, comparable assessment.

      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "In November 2009, the baseline data was collected and the
      information treatment was delivered." (p. 2)
      
      2) "Our results show that, almost three years after the treatment
      was implemented, ... had a sizeable and statistically significant
      effect on the ENLACE test score—0.22 standard deviations (σ)."
      (p. 2)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The intervention began in late 2009 and primary outcomes were
      measured using data from 2012, nearly three academic years later.
      This far exceeds one full term between the start of the intervention
      and the outcome measurement.
      
      Final sentence: The follow-up spanned multiple terms after the
      intervention, so Term Duration is met.

      1) "Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics for the full sample
      as well as separately for boys and girls, distinguishing between
      students in the treatment and control groups." (p. 6)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The authors present detailed demographic and baseline test‑score
      data for both treatment and control groups in Table 1. This table
      clearly documents the control group’s composition and baseline
      metrics, fulfilling the documentation requirement.
      
      Final sentence: The control group’s baseline characteristics are
      clearly documented, so this criterion is met.

      treatment schools and 28 control schools." (p. 4)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The paper explicitly randomises entire schools rather than
      individual classes or students. This satisfies the stronger
      requirement for a school‑level RCT.
      
      Final sentence: School‑level randomisation meets the School‑level
      RCT criterion.

      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "In 2009 the Mexican Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) ...
      designed and piloted an intervention ... known as Percepciones,
      the pilot program included an evaluation strategy based on a
      stratified randomized control trial." (pp. 319–320)
      
      2) "We … are especially indebted to Martha Hernandez,
      Elizabeth Monroy, and Paula Villasenor, who were responsible
      for project and data management at SEP … The views expressed
      here are those of the authors alone." (Acknowledgments)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The Percepciones pilot was designed and implemented by SEP,
      while the data collection, analysis, and reporting were carried
      out by external researchers affiliated with the World Bank and
      University of Surrey. This clear separation of design and evaluation
      ensures an independent conduct of the trial.
      
      Final sentence: An external research team conducted the evaluation,
      fulfilling the Independent Conduct criterion.

      to May 2012." (p. 4)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The experimental period covers nearly three years, from mid-2009 to
      mid-2012, encompassing multiple academic years. The outcomes were
      evaluated well over a year after the intervention began, satisfying
      the Year Duration criterion.
      
      Final sentence: The study’s timeline extends past one full academic
      year, so Year Duration is met.

      1) "On average, students in the treatment group spent 12 min
      interacting with the interface." (p. 4)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      Although the treatment group received a brief 12‑minute information
      session, this additional time is minimal relative to total class
      time. The control group continued with business-as-usual schooling
      and was not deprived of any substantial instructional time or
      resources.
      
      Final sentence: The minimal extra time in the intervention is
      negligible, so Balanced Resources is met.

      "On average, students in the treatment group spent 12 min

      The difference in time or resources between groups is trivial and
      integral to the intervention, unlikely to bias the results.

      1) *No mention of any independent replication study is found in the

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The authors do not cite any separate research team that attempted
      to replicate this intervention and its findings. A search for
      external replication studies did not reveal any published
      independent replications of this RCT.
      
      Final sentence: No independent replication is reported, so
      Reproduced is not met.

      The paper does not reference any independent replication
      studies, and none were found in external literature.

      1) "... on standardized test scores in math and language (Spanish)
      at the end of high school, ..." (p. 2)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The study’s academic outcomes are limited to math and Spanish test
      scores. Other core subjects (e.g., science or social studies) were
      not assessed, failing to meet the All‑subject Exams requirement.
      
      Final sentence: Only two subjects are assessed without justification,
      so this criterion is not met.

      "... on standardized test scores in math and language (Spanish)

      on learning outcomes ..." (p. 9)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      Students were tracked through the end of high school to determine
      whether they graduated on time. The inclusion of on-time high school
      completion as an outcome indicates that the study followed participants
      to a key educational milestone.
      
      Final sentence: The study tracked students until high school
      graduation, so Graduation Tracking is met.

      of on-time high school graduation, but had a large positive effect

      The RCT measured on-time high school completion, meaning participants
      were followed through the completion of that educational level.

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The paper does not reference a pre-registered analysis plan or
      registration on a trial registry platform. The study appears to
      have been conducted without prior registration.
      
      Final sentence: Without evidence of pre-registration, this criterion
      is not met.
    quote: null
    explanation: >-
      No pre-registration statement or registry ID is provided in the
      paper or its references.
