abstract: >-
  Purposes Anatomy is fundamental in medical education, yet cadaveric dissection
  faces challenges including limited specimens, high costs, and chemical hazards.
  Interactive anatomy tables such as the Pirogov system offer innovative
  alternatives, but evidence from Southeast Asia is limited. Methods In a
  prospective cohort, 188 medical students (139 in Y1 and 49 in Y2) were randomly
  assigned to the Pirogov table group (Group A, n = 99) or the cadaveric
  dissection group (Group B, n = 89). Knowledge acquisition was measured using a
  validated 20-item multiple-choice test before and after the intervention.
  Student perceptions were evaluated with a 10-item Likert-scale questionnaire
  covering four domains: knowledge and understanding, spatial visualization and
  relationships, learning experience and engagement, and effectiveness and
  practical value. Data were analyzed using paired and independent t-tests and
  Welch’s t-test. Results Both groups showed significant knowledge gains (Group
  A: 4.3 ± 1.65 to 5.2 ± 1.75, p < 0.001; Group B: 4.2 ± 1.92 to 5.1 ± 1.64,
  p < 0.001), with no difference between them (p = 0.656). Likert ratings were
  consistently high across domains, with means from 4.43 to 4.48. Y1 students
  reported higher ratings than Y2 in learning experience (p = 0.023). Conclusion
  The Pirogov table and cadaveric dissection were associated with similar
  short-term improvements in anatomy knowledge. Students valued the Pirogov table
  for visualization and engagement. These findings support integrating digital
  tools with cadaveric dissection to enhance anatomy education, particularly in
  resource-limited contexts.

      In a prospective cohort, 188 medical students (139 in Y1 and 49 in Y2) were
      randomly assigned to the Pirogov table group (Group A, n = 99) or the
      cadaveric dissection group (Group B, n = 89).
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In a prospective cohort, 188 medical students (139 in Y1 and 49 in Y2)
      were randomly assigned to the Pirogov table group (Group A, n = 99) or the
      cadaveric dissection group (Group B, n = 89)." (p. 2/11)

      2) "Randomization generated in Microsoft Excel using a fixed random seed
      and permuted blocks of four." (p. 3/11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion C requires randomization at the class level (or a stronger
      unit, such as schools) to reduce contamination that can happen when
      individuals within the same classroom/setting receive different
      conditions. Here, the unit randomized is explicitly "medical students"
      (individual participants), not intact classes or schools.

      Although the paper includes contamination-reduction procedures (simultaneous
      sessions in separate rooms and instructions not to discuss content), those
      procedural controls do not change the unit of randomization itself. The
      intervention is also not described as a one-to-one tutoring/personal
      teaching exception.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is not met because randomization was at the
      individual student level rather than at the class (or school) level.

    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured using a faculty-designed 20-item MCQ rather than a
      widely recognized standardized exam.

      Eligible students were enrolled and completed a validated 20-item
      multiple-choice pre-test designed by the anatomy faculty (S1 File).

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Eligible students were enrolled and completed a validated 20-item
      multiple-choice pre-test designed by the anatomy faculty (S1 File)."
      (p. 4/11)

      2) "Knowledge acquisition: Assessed using a standardized multiple-choice
      questionnaire (20 items covering musculoskeletal anatomy)." (p. 5/11)

      3) "The questionnaire was designed and validated by anatomy faculty, with
      good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.82)." (p. 5/11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion E requires a standardized, widely recognized exam (for
      example, a national/state standardized test or a broadly established
      external exam). While the paper describes the MCQ as "validated" and
      reports psychometrics (Cronbach’s alpha, difficulty and discrimination
      indices), it is still an internally created instrument: it was "designed
      by the anatomy faculty" for this study/context.

      The word "standardized" here refers to consistent administration and
      format, not an external standardized exam with broad adoption and
      comparability across institutions.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because the assessment was created
      by the local anatomy faculty rather than being a widely recognized
      standardized exam.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The post-test was administered immediately after the sessions, which is far
      less than one academic term after intervention start.
    quote: >-
      The post-test was administered immediately after the session and before the
      cross-exposure phase, ensuring no contamination of primary outcome
      measures.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Both groups attended two teaching sessions on the musculoskeletal
      system (1.5 h each)." (p. 4/11)

      2) "Students then completed a post-test of identical format." (p. 4/11)

      3) "The post-test was administered immediately after the session and before
      the cross-exposure phase, ensuring no contamination of primary outcome
      measures." (p. 4/11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion T requires that outcomes be measured at least one full
      academic term (typically ~3-4 months) after the intervention begins,
      allowing time for effects to stabilize and persist beyond very short-term
      gains.

      The quoted procedure shows two short sessions (total 3 hours) and a
      post-test administered "immediately after the session." This is an
      immediate post-intervention measurement with no term-length delay from
      intervention start to outcome measurement.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is not met because outcomes were measured
      immediately after instruction rather than at least one academic term later.
  d:

    explanation: >-
      The comparison (cadaveric dissection) group and baseline characteristics
      are described with group sizes and baseline balance checks, meeting the
      control documentation requirement.
    quote: >-

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In total, 188 students were enrolled and assigned into two groups:
      • Group A (n = 99): Pirogov table • Group B (n = 89): Cadaveric dissection"
      (p. 3/11)

      2) "Baseline comparability between randomized groups was assessed through
      independent t-tests (continuous variables) and chi-square tests
      (categorical variables)." (p. 6/11)

      3) "No statistically significant differences were observed in age, gender
      distribution, or pre-test scores, suggesting acceptable balance at the
      start of the study." (p. 6/11)

      4) "The demographic characteristics of the two study groups were
      comparable." (p. 6/11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion D requires that the control group be clearly documented,
      including who they are, what they received, and baseline/demographic
      information enabling comparison.

      The paper clearly specifies the two conditions, including the "Cadaveric
      dissection" comparison group (Group B) and the "Pirogov table" group
      (Group A), with exact sample sizes. It also reports baseline balance checks
      and explicitly states that age, gender, and pre-test scores were not
      significantly different across groups. This provides meaningful
      documentation that the control/comparison group existed and was comparable
      at baseline.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the control/comparison group is
      clearly defined with group sizes and baseline demographic and performance
      comparability information.
  s:

      Randomization occurred among individual students, not among schools (or
      equivalent institutions/sites).

      2) "This was a prospective study, conducted at the Faculty of Medicine,
      Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (April 2024–April 2025)."
      (p. 3/11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion S requires school-level (or equivalent institution/site-
      level) randomization, meaning whole schools (or analogous sites) are
      assigned to conditions.

      The study took place at a single faculty and describes random assignment of
      "medical students" to conditions. There is no indication that multiple
      schools (or multiple independent sites) were randomized. Therefore, the
      design does not meet the school-level randomization requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met because the unit of randomization
      was students within one institution, not schools or sites.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper describes blinding and an independent administrator for
      allocation, but it does not provide evidence of a truly independent
      external evaluation team separate from those designing/teaching and
      building the study instruments.
    quote: >-
      Allocation was concealed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes
      by an independent administrator.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Allocation was concealed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed
      envelopes by an independent administrator." (p. 3/11)

      2) "Test scoring and data analysis were performed by assessors blinded to
      group assignment." (p. 3/11)

      3) "Eligible students were enrolled and completed a validated 20-item
      multiple-choice pre-test designed by the anatomy faculty (S1 File)."
      (p. 4/11)

      4) "Specifically, both groups were taught by the same pair of anatomy
      instructors..." (p. 4/11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion I expects the study to be conducted independently from the
      group that designed the intervention, to reduce risks of bias in
      implementation and analysis. This paper includes some bias-reducing
      features (allocation concealment, and assessors blinded to group
      assignment).

      However, the paper also states the assessment instrument was "designed by
      the anatomy faculty" and that instruction was delivered by an instructor
      team within the same program. The paper does not clearly state that an
      external third-party evaluation organization (separate from the teaching
      faculty and study authors) designed the evaluation, managed data
      collection, and controlled analysis end-to-end.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because, despite blinding and
      allocation concealment, the study does not demonstrate third-party
      independent conduct separate from those creating the study instruments and
      delivering instruction.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured immediately after teaching sessions, far short of
      75% of an academic year after intervention start.
    quote: >-
      The post-test was administered immediately after the session and before the
      cross-exposure phase, ensuring no contamination of primary outcome
      measures.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Both groups attended two teaching sessions on the musculoskeletal
      system (1.5 h each)." (p. 4/11)

      2) "The post-test was administered immediately after the session and before
      the cross-exposure phase, ensuring no contamination of primary outcome
      measures." (p. 4/11)

      3) "This was a prospective study, conducted at the Faculty of Medicine,
      Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (April 2024–April 2025)."
      (p. 3/11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least 75% of an academic
      year after the intervention begins. The timing relevant for Y is the
      interval from intervention start (for a participant) to outcome measurement
      (for that participant), not simply the overall calendar window during
      which the study ran.

      The study’s primary knowledge outcome is measured via a post-test given
      "immediately after the session." Even though the project ran during
      April 2024–April 2025, each participant’s treatment-to-measurement interval
      is essentially same-day, not year-long.

      Also, per ERCT instructions, if criterion T is not met then Y is not met;
      this study clearly fails T due to immediate post-testing.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because outcome measurement occurred
      immediately after instruction rather than after most of an academic year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Instructional time and core teaching inputs were standardized across
      groups, and the control group received a comparable active alternative
      (cadaveric dissection) rather than a lower-resource condition.
    quote: >-
      Teaching duration, content, and instructors were standardized across groups
      to ensure comparability.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Both groups attended two teaching sessions on the musculoskeletal
      system (1.5 h each)." (p. 4/11)

      2) "Regarding practice sessions, Group A received instruction using the
      Pirogov interactive anatomy table (Figs 1 and 2), whereas Group B
      participated in cadaveric dissection." (p. 4/11)

      3) "Teaching duration, content, and instructors were standardized across
      groups to ensure comparability." (p. 4/11)

      4) "Specifically, both groups were taught by the same pair of anatomy
      instructors..." (p. 4/11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion B asks whether time and resources are balanced between
      intervention and control, unless extra resources are explicitly the
      treatment variable being tested.

      Here, instructional time is the same in both arms (two sessions of equal
      duration), and the paper states that content, instructors, and lesson plan
      were standardized across groups. The control condition is not "no
      treatment"; it is an active, resource-intensive alternative modality
      (cadaveric dissection). The primary comparison is therefore between two
      teaching modalities delivered under the same schedule and instructional
      structure, rather than between unequal exposure/time/budget conditions.

      The paper does not indicate that one group received additional optional
      instructional time, extra tutoring, or extra materials beyond the modality
      itself during the primary pre-test to immediate post-test comparison.
      Therefore, under the ERCT decision logic, extra time/budget is not the
      driver of differences, and the groups appear balanced.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is met because both groups received comparable
      instructional time and standardized teaching inputs, with an active control
      rather than a lower-resource condition.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication of this specific study was identified in the
      paper, and a web search did not locate an external replication as of the
      ERCT check date.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To our knowledge, no controlled study has compared the Pirogov
      interactive table with cadaveric dissection in this region." (p. 3/11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion R requires evidence that the study has been independently
      replicated by a different team in a different context and published in a
      peer-reviewed journal.

      In the paper itself, the authors position the work as filling a gap ("no
      controlled study") rather than stating that this specific trial has been
      replicated. In addition, a web search performed on 2026-02-15 using the
      DOI, article title, and key author names did not identify any peer-reviewed
      independent replication of this exact study.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because no independent replication
      of this specific study could be identified as of 2026-02-15.
  a:

      2) "Knowledge acquisition: Assessed using a standardized multiple-choice
      questionnaire (20 items covering musculoskeletal anatomy)." (p. 5/11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessments across all
      main subjects, and ERCT instructions state that if criterion E is not met
      then criterion A is not met.

      This study uses a faculty-designed MCQ focused on musculoskeletal anatomy,
      not a widely recognized standardized exam, and it does not assess all core
      subjects. Therefore A fails both because E fails and because the outcome is
      not an all-subject standardized assessment.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because standardized exam-based
      assessment (E) is not satisfied and the study does not assess all main
      subjects using standardized exams.

      (p. 9/11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation, and ERCT
      instructions state that if criterion Y is not met then G is not met.

      The authors explicitly acknowledge there was no delayed follow-up beyond
      the immediate post-test. There is no description of tracking students
      through the end of medical school (or any graduation milestone). In
      addition, a web search performed on 2026-02-15 for follow-up publications
      by the same author team and for the same cohort did not identify any
      published graduation-tracking follow-up for this study.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because the study includes only
      immediate post-testing with no graduation tracking (and Y is not met).

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion P requires a publicly accessible pre-registered protocol

      evidence that registration occurred before data collection began.

      The paper provides ethics/IRB approval and dates, but it does not provide a

## Change Summary

- Added missing metadata:
  - `paper_link` set to the official DOI landing page.
  - `pdf_link` set to the PLOS direct PDF endpoint (printable PDF).
  - `date_erct_check` set to **2026-02-15**.
- Checked and normalized quotes to match the paper text (removed report-only
  line breaks while keeping wording verbatim).
- Updated criteria **R**, **G**, and **P** to reflect an internet check:
  - No independent replication found for **R** as of 2026-02-15.
  - No graduation-tracking follow-up publication found for **G** as of
    2026-02-15 (and **Y** is not met, so **G** cannot be met).
  - No public pre-registration record found for **P** as of 2026-02-15.
- Recomputed ERCT level under the current criterion order; it remains
  `erct_level: 0` because Level 1 criteria are not all met.
