abstract: >-
  A typical mathematics assignment consists primarily of practice problems requiring
  the strategy introduced in the immediately preceding lesson (e.g., a dozen problems
  that are solved by using the Pythagorean theorem). This means that students know
  which strategy is needed to solve each problem before they read the problem. In an
  alternative approach known as interleaved practice, problems from the course are
  rearranged so that a portion of each assignment includes different kinds of problems
  in an interleaved order. Interleaved practice requires students to choose a strategy
  on the basis of the problem itself, as they must do when they encounter a problem
  during a comprehensive examination or subsequent course. In the experiment reported
  here, 126 seventh-grade students received the same practice problems over a 3-month
  period, but the problems were arranged so that skills were learned by interleaved
  practice or by the usual blocked approach. The practice phase concluded with a
  review session, followed 1 or 30 days later by an unannounced test. Compared with
  blocked practice, interleaved practice produced higher scores on both the immediate
  and delayed tests (Cohen’s ds = 0.42 and 0.79, respectively).

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Practice schedule was a counterbalanced within-subject variable. Students in
      Group 1 received interleaved practice of graph problems and blocked practice of
      slope problems, and Group 2 received the reverse. Group 1 (n = 59) included four
      classes (two taught by Teacher A, and two taught by Teacher B). Group 2 (n = 67)
      included five classes (two by A, two by B, and one by C)." (p. 4)

      2) "Classes were assigned to groups as follows. Two of the classes were designated
      as “honors/gifted” by the school, and these two classes were randomly assigned to
      different groups. The remaining seven classes were deemed by the school as being
      at the same level, and each of these classes was randomly assigned to one of the
      two groups with the constraint that teachers with more than one participating class
      had an equal number of classes in each group." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper specifies that entire classes were assigned to different practice
      schedules, with Group 1 and Group 2 receiving distinct combinations of interleaved
      and blocked practice for graph and slope problems. The randomization occurred at
      the class level, as evidenced by the assignment process described, ensuring that
      each class received a consistent intervention type. This aligns with the ERCT
      requirement for a class-level RCT to prevent cross-group contamination within
      classes, as the intervention was uniformly applied across all students in each
      class.

      Final sentence: The criterion is met because the study randomized entire classes
      to different practice conditions.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students were tested 1 or 30 days after the review. ... The test booklet
      included a cover sheet, a sheet of paper with three graph problems, and a sheet of
      paper with three slope problems. ... None of the problems had appeared in either a
      practice assignment or the review." (p. 5)

      2) "We created six versions of the test by reordering the problems within each
      page, and the page with the slope problems preceded the page with the graph
      problems in three of the six versions." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study utilized a test designed specifically by the researchers, consisting of
      graph and slope problems tailored to the intervention, with six versions created
      by reordering the problems. There is no indication that this test is a standardized,
      widely recognized exam, such as a state or national assessment. The ERCT criterion
      requires the use of standardized exams to ensure objectivity and comparability,
      and the custom nature of this test does not meet that standard.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met because the study used a custom-made test
      rather than a standardized exam.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study consisted of 10 practice assignments, a review session, and a test.
      ... Students received the 10 assignments on Days 1, 6, 14, 32–33, 33 or 35, 35 or
      38, 45–46, 72–75, 81–82, and 86–88." (p. 5)

      2) "The final practice assignment was collected by teachers on Days 87–89." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention spanned from Day 1 to Day 88, approximately three months, which
      aligns with the typical duration of an academic term (3-4 months). Although the
      exact alignment with the academic calendar is not specified, the duration is
      substantial enough to meet the ERCT requirement for at least one academic term,
      allowing for a meaningful assessment of the intervention’s impact over time.

      Final sentence: The criterion is met because the intervention lasted approximately
      three months, which can be considered a full academic term.

      1) "Participation in the study required documentation of parent permission and
      student assent, which we received from 150 of the 164 students in the participating
      classes. ... The final sample included 126 students. ... By these data, 38% of the
      students received free or reduced-price lunch, and the sample was ethnically
      diverse (10% Asian, 14% Black, 22% Hispanic, 6% multiracial, and 47% White)."
      (p. 3)

      2) "The two groups scored similarly well on a test consisting of six multiple-choice
      problems from the Grade-8 mathematics portion of the National Assessment of
      Educational Progress, or NAEP (National Center for Education Statistics, 2013),
      76% (SD = 22%) vs. 79% (SD = 22%), t(108) = 0.62, p = .54, Cohen’s d = 0.12."
      (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study employs a within-subject design where each student experienced both
      interleaved and blocked practice, but it provides detailed documentation of the
      participants’ characteristics, including demographics and baseline performance on
      the NAEP test. This documentation enables a robust comparison between conditions,
      satisfying the ERCT requirement for a well-documented control group, even though
      the control is integrated within the subjects rather than a separate group.

      Final sentence: The criterion is met because the study provides detailed
      documentation of the participants’ characteristics and baseline performance.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study took place at a large public middle school in Tampa, Florida, during
      the 2013–2014 school year. Three mathematics teachers and nine of their
      seventh-grade classes participated." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study was conducted within a single middle school, with randomization occurring
      at the class level across nine classes, not across multiple schools. The ERCT
      criterion for a school-level RCT requires randomization among schools to capture
      broader institutional effects, which this study does not fulfill.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met because the study was conducted within a
      single school, not across multiple schools.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students received graph problems and slope problems, and no student saw the
      same problem more than once during the experiment." (p. 3)

      2) "The test booklet included a cover sheet, a sheet of paper with three graph
      problems, and a sheet of paper with three slope problems." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study assessed only mathematics outcomes, specifically graph and slope
      problems, without evaluating other core subjects like language arts or science.
      The ERCT criterion requires assessment across all core subjects to ensure a
      comprehensive impact evaluation. Additionally, since criterion E (standardized
      exam) is not met, criterion A cannot be satisfied regardless.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met because the study only assessed
      mathematics, not all core subjects, and did not use a standardized exam.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention lasted approximately three months (Day 1 to Day 88), which is
      less than a full academic year (typically 9-10 months). The ERCT criterion requires
      a year-long duration to assess sustained impact, which this study does not meet.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met because the intervention lasted only three
      months, not a full academic year.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Every student received the same practice problems over a 3-month period, but
      the problems were arranged so that skills were learned by interleaved practice or
      by the usual blocked approach." (p. 1)

      2) "The 10 assignments included 12 graph problems and 12 slope problems, and the
      remaining problems were drawn from unrelated topics (fractions, proportions,
      percentages, statistics, and probability)." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The within-subject design ensured that each student received both interleaved and
      blocked practice, with identical problems and time allocation (10 assignments over
      3 months). The ERCT criterion requires balanced resources, and since the
      intervention involved rearranging existing problems without additional time or
      materials, resources were inherently equal across conditions.

      Final sentence: The criterion is met because the study design ensured that all
      students received the same problems and resources, just arranged differently.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study’s follow-up was limited to tests administered 1 or 30 days post-review,
      with no tracking until graduation. The ERCT criterion requires long-term tracking
      to assess effects through to graduation, which this short-term follow-up does not
      satisfy.

      The paper does not reference any independent replication by a different research
      team. The ERCT criterion requires such replication to ensure result generalizability,
