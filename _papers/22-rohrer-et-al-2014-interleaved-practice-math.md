  A typical mathematics assignment consists primarily of practice problems
  requiring the strategy introduced in the immediately preceding lesson
  (e.g., a dozen problems that are solved by using the Pythagorean theorem).
  This means that students know which strategy is needed to solve each
  problem before they read the problem. In an alternative approach known
  as interleaved practice, problems from the course are rearranged so that a
  portion of each assignment includes different kinds of problems in an
  interleaved order. Interleaved practice requires students to choose a
  strategy on the basis of the problem itself, as they must do when they
  encounter a problem during a comprehensive examination or subsequent
  course. In the experiment reported here, 126 seventh-grade students
  received the same practice problems over a 3‑month period, but the
  problems were arranged so that skills were learned by interleaved
  practice or by the usual blocked approach. The practice phase concluded
  with a review session, followed 1 or 30 days later by an unannounced
  test. Compared with blocked practice, interleaved practice produced
  higher scores on both the immediate and delayed tests (Cohen’s ds = 0.42
  and 0.79, respectively).

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Two of the classes were designated as ‘honors/gifted’ by the school,
      and these two classes were randomly assigned to different groups. The
      remaining seven classes were deemed by the school as being at the same
      level, and each of these classes was randomly assigned to one of the two
      groups.” (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomization occurred at the class level, with intact classes assigned to
      either interleaved or blocked practice. Under the ERCT standard, class-
      level randomization prevents contamination and thus satisfies criterion C.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is met because the study randomized intact
      classes to treatment and control groups.
    explanation: >
      Randomization was conducted at the class level with intact classes
      assigned to each condition.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The test booklet included a cover sheet, a sheet of paper with three
      graph problems, and a sheet of paper with three slope problems. We
      created six versions of the test by reordering the problems within each
      page ... None of the problems had appeared in either a practice
      assignment or the review.” (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Outcomes were measured using tests created by the authors for this
      study, not via any widely recognized standardized exam. There is no
      indication of use of a state or national test instrument. Thus, criterion E
      is not satisfied.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because the study used custom
      tests rather than standardized examinations.
    explanation: >
      The study employed custom-designed tests of graphing and slope
      problems rather than a recognized standardized exam.

      1) “Students received the 10 assignments on Days 1, 6, 14, 32–33,
      33 or 35, 35 or 38, 45–46, 72–75, 81–82, and 86–88. Every student
      received the same review on Day 93, about 5 days after the last
      assignment. Students were tested 1 or 30 days after the review.” (pp. 5–6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention and outcome measurements spanned approximately
      93 days—about a full academic term (3 months). Final assessments
      were conducted after this term-long interval, satisfying criterion T.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is met because outcomes were measured at
      least one full academic term after the intervention began.
    explanation: >
      The study measured outcomes after approximately three months,
      satisfying the term-duration requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Practice schedule was a counterbalanced within-subject variable.
      Students in Group 1 received interleaved practice … and Group 2
      received the reverse. Group 1 (n = 59) … Group 2 (n = 67) …” (p. 5)

      2) “The two groups scored similarly well on a test consisting of six
      multiple-choice problems from the Grade‑8 NAEP … 76% (SD 22%) vs. 79%
      (SD 22%), t(108) = 0.62, p = .54, Cohen’s d = 0.12.” (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The control (blocked) group’s size and baseline comparability via NAEP
      scores are documented, and both groups received identical instructional
      materials and review. This satisfies criterion D.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the control group’s makeup,
      size, and baseline performance are clearly documented.
    explanation: >
      The control group’s size and baseline comparability (NAEP scores) are
      documented in detail.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomization was at the class level within a single school. There is
      no evidence that entire schools were randomized. Thus, criterion S is
      not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met because randomization did not
      occur at the school level.
    explanation: >
      Randomization was at the class level within one school, not across
      multiple schools.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The authors designed, delivered, and scored the intervention and
      assessments themselves. No independent third-party evaluation is
      reported. Thus, criterion I is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because the same research team
      conducted and assessed the intervention without external oversight.
    explanation: >
      The study was conducted and scored by the authors, with no
      independent external evaluation.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study lasted roughly 3 months, far shorter than a full academic
      year, and there was no year‑long tracking. Thus, criterion Y is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because the study did not track
      outcomes for a full academic year.

      Outcomes were measured within three months, not tracked over an
      academic year.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Both groups had identical assignments and review sessions; they differed
      only in how problems were ordered (interleaved vs. blocked). Neither group
      received any additional resources or instructional time. Therefore, criterion B is met.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is met because both groups had equal
      instructional time and materials.
    explanation: >-
      Both groups received the same number of assignments, problems, and
      review sessions, ensuring balanced time and resources.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Although test scores showed positive effects for those who received the interleaved practice style over those who received blocked practice, this was not statistically significant.” (Ostrow et al., 2015)

      Detailed Analysis:

      An independent classroom study of interleaved practice (Ostrow et al., 2015) found only a non-significant trend favoring interleaving. No other external team has fully replicated this study’s findings. Thus, criterion R is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because no independent replication has confirmed the results.
    explanation: >-
      There is no evidence of an independent replication study by a different
      research team that confirms these findings.

      (pp. 1, 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The outcomes focused exclusively on graphing and slope in
      mathematics. No other subjects were assessed. Thus, criterion A is
      not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because only graphing and slope
      problems were assessed.
    explanation: >-
      The study only assessed mathematics graphing and slope problems,
      not a full range of subjects.

      criterion G is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because no long-term tracking
      through graduation was conducted.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper does not reference any pre-registration or registry before
      data collection, and no pre-study registration was found elsewhere. Thus, criterion P is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met because the study lacks any
      evidence of pre-registration.
    explanation: >-
      The paper does not report a pre-registration or registry before the
      intervention began.
