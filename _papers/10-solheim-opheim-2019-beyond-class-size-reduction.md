abstract: >-
  The effect of a reduced pupil–teacher ratio has mainly been investigated as
  that of reduced class size. Hence we know little about alternative methods
  of reducing the pupil–teacher ratio. Deploying additional teachers in
  selected subjects may be a more flexible way, both pedagogically and
  financially, to exploit the opportunities for adapting instruction inherent
  in reducing the number of students under a teacher’s responsibility. In
  this paper, we discuss limitations to previous class-size research and
  suggest more flexible ways to implement a reduced pupil–teacher ratio. One
  alternative approach is illustrated with a change in national policy in
  Norway to increase teacher density as well as research following this
  initiative.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To illustrate how an alternative approach to a reduced PTR
         might be implemented, the last part of this paper will be devoted to
         describing a change in Norwegian educational policy..."

      Detailed Analysis:

      The authors explicitly state that the paper’s final section is devoted to
      describing a policy change and a research initiative, rather than
      reporting an original class-level experimental study. There is no
      description of any random assignment of classes to different
      conditions in this paper.

      Final sentence: The Class-level RCT criterion is not met because this
      paper does not report an actual class-level randomized trial.
    quote: null
    explanation: The paper does not describe any randomization at the class level.
    met: false
  e:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students’ skills in mathematics are measured through short tests
         before and during the intervention (pre-test, intermediary tests),
         and the Norwegian national test in numeracy for fifth-grade students
         will serve as a post-test for all four cohorts of students."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Although the paper describes plans to use a standardized national exam
      in the 1+1 project, it does not itself administer or report any such
      exam-based outcomes. It remains a conceptual design.

      Final sentence: The Exam-based Assessment criterion is not met because
      the paper does not implement any standardized exam-based outcome
      assessment.
    quote: null
    explanation: No standardized exam-based assessment is implemented in the paper.
    met: false
  t:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The treatment classes received an additional teacher in Norwegian
         lessons, 8 × 45 min a week, for 38 weeks, in grades 1 and 2."

      2) "The treatment effects on the students’ motivation and literacy skills
         will be evaluated immediately after the intervention and at a two-
         year follow-up."

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper outlines a multi-year intervention timeline but does not
      report measured outcomes at least one term after the start. It only
      describes when outcomes will be collected in theory.

      Final sentence: The Term Duration criterion is not met because no
      term-long outcomes are actually reported.
    quote: null
    explanation: No term-long outcome measurement is reported in the paper.
    met: false
  d:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "At each school there was one treatment class and one control class.
         ... The control classes received no additional teaching resources."

      Detailed Analysis:

      While the design includes control classes with business-as-usual
      instruction, the paper provides no demographic or baseline data for
      those controls, preventing a proper comparison.

      Final sentence: The Documented Control Group criterion is not met
      because the control group’s characteristics are not detailed.
    quote: null
    explanation: Control group demographics and baseline data are not provided.
    met: false
  s:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "An RCT is being carried out during four academic years (2016–2020).
         The schools are divided into two groups of equal size – a treatment
         group (80 schools) and a comparison group (82 schools)."

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper describes a school-level randomization design but does not
      itself execute it within its own study—this discussion remains
      descriptive, not demonstrative.

      Final sentence: The School-level RCT criterion is not met because no
      actual school-level randomization is reported here.
    quote: null
    explanation: No school-level random assignment is executed as part of this paper.
    met: false

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Both projects involve a frequent dialogue and regular feedback
         meetings with the participating schools and municipalities..."

      Detailed Analysis:

      The authors describe close involvement in implementation and
      evaluation, implying that the same team designed and conducted the
      trials without third-party oversight.

      Final sentence: The Independent Conduct criterion is not met because
      there is no indication of an external evaluation team.
    quote: null
    explanation: The study was conducted by the intervention's own authors.
    met: false

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "An RCT is being carried out during four academic years (2016–2020)."

      2) "…the duration of intervention was reduced from 4 to 2 years;
         interventions were terminated after the 2017/2018 academic year."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Both described projects span more than one academic year, but the
      paper itself does not report outcomes over a full year; it only outlines
      the planned duration.

      Final sentence: The Year Duration criterion is not met because no
      year-long follow-up results are reported.
    quote: null
    explanation: No outcomes tracked over a full academic year are provided.
    met: false
  b:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The control classes received no additional teaching resources."

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention added teaching resources to treatment classes, while
      control classes did not receive equivalent resources. Because extra
      teacher time is the treatment variable, no balancing was needed for
      controls—but this leads to an imbalance per ERCT rules.

      Final sentence: The Balanced Resources criterion is not met due to an
      inherent resource imbalance by design.
    quote: null
    explanation: Treatment classes had extra teacher time; controls did not.
    met: false

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Bonesrønning et al. (2022) investigate small-group instruction in
         mathematics and find similar effects..."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Although an independent team studied small-group math instruction,
      there is no documented replication of the Two Teachers literacy
      intervention by another research group. No true independent
      reproduction of the paper’s specific trials is cited.

      Final sentence: The Reproduced criterion is not met because no
      independent replication of these exact interventions is found.
    quote: null
    explanation: No independent replication of the interventions is reported.
    met: false

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The treatment effects on the students’ motivation and literacy
         skills will be evaluated immediately after the intervention and at a
         two-year follow-up."

      2) "the Norwegian national test in numeracy for fifth-grade students
         will serve as a post-test for all four cohorts of students."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Each project is confined to one subject area (literacy or math). The
      paper does not assess impacts across all core subjects, so potential
      trade-offs are not examined.

      Final sentence: The All-subject Exams criterion is not met because
      assessments are limited to the targeted subjects.
    quote: null
    explanation: Outcomes measured only in targeted subjects, not across all.
    met: false
  g:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The treatment effects... will be evaluated immediately after the
         intervention and at a two-year follow-up."

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper describes follow-up to two years post-intervention, not
      through any graduation milestone. No tracking until graduation is
      reported here.

      Final sentence: The Graduation Tracking criterion is not met because
      participants were not followed through to graduation.
    quote: null
    explanation: No long-term tracking through graduation is provided.
    met: false

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "...the design had to be changed compared with the original plan as
         reported in the study protocol." (page 150)

      2) "OSF pre-registration. doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/YWQVC."

      Detailed Analysis:

      The mention of modifying a predefined study protocol shows the
      existence of a prespecified plan. Furthermore, an external follow-up
      paper explicitly cites OSF preregistration before data collection,
      confirming a formal preregistration.

      Final sentence: The Pre-registered Protocol criterion is met because
      the interventions were formally preregistered before data collection.
    quote: "OSF pre-registration. doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/YWQVC."
    explanation: The RCT was preregistered on OSF prior to data collection.
