  Although Asian economies have increased access to education, students'
  learning often trails grade level expectations. In the Philippines,
  learning worsened through prolonged classroom closure during the
  coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Together with the Department
  of Education, we conducted a 42-school randomized controlled trial of
  computer-assisted instruction in remote areas of the country. The
  tested intervention consisted of digitized learning modules deployed
  on tablets that connected to school local Wi-Fi networks for junior
  high school students. The tablets were the main source of instruction
  for 2.5 months before schools reopened, after which they served as a
  supplement to, rather than a replacement for, in-person instruction.
  We find that the intervention increased student learning in
  mathematics, but not in English. For mathematics, we estimate
  intent-to-treat effects of 0.34 standard deviations of the
  distribution of test scores and average treatment-on-the-treated
  effects of 0.46 standard deviations for schools that ever used the
  digitized materials. Students with higher levels of "grit" at
  baseline benefit more from the intervention, as do those who have
  higher baseline test scores. The mathematics treatment-on-the-treated
  effect for schools that continued usage for a second year is 1.6
  standard deviations, suggesting that those schools drove the observed
  impacts.

# Criteria substructure
criteria:

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We identified 42 eligible schools for the tablet intervention
      pilot using a list of 'last mile schools'..." (p. 10)

      2) "At the baseline, schools were paired within divisions based
      on similar sizes. Within each pair, one school was randomly
      assigned to participate in the program ('treatment' schools)
      while the other was assigned to the 'control' school group, so
      that there were 21 treatment and 21 control schools." (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study explicitly describes randomizing at the school level
      ("one school was randomly assigned..."). According to the ERCT
      standard, a school-level RCT is stronger than a class-level RCT
      and automatically satisfies the class-level criterion. The
      randomization was not done at the individual student level within
      classes, thus avoiding within-class contamination.

      Criterion C is met because the study randomized entire schools
      to treatment and control conditions.
    quote: >-
      Within each pair, one school was randomly assigned to participate
      in the program ('treatment' schools) while the other was assigned
      to the 'control' school group
    explanation: >-
      The study randomized assignment at the school level, which
      satisfies and exceeds the class-level requirement.
    met: true
  e:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Baseline and endline proficiency in math and English were
      measured using short assessments administered in person at the
      participating schools... The 21-item, 30-minute tests were
      aligned with DepEd's MELCs and included concepts and contents
      from up to three lower grade levels." (p. 11)

      2) "The assessments were validated by a panel of educators and
      DepEd officials to ensure alignment with target competencies and
      clarity. A pilot study of 60 students from Metro Manila further
      refined the tests..." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires the use of widely recognized
      standardized exams (like national exams or established
      international assessments). While the tests used here were
      "aligned with DepEd's MELCs" (Minimum Expected Learning
      Competencies) and validated by a panel, they were specifically
      developed and refined ("refined the tests", "final design") for
      this study rather than being an off-the-shelf standardized
      instrument. They are described as "short assessments"
      administered specifically for the data collection. This falls
      under the category of custom-made assessments.

      Criterion E is not met because the study used custom-designed
      assessments validated for the project rather than widely
      recognized standardized exams.
    quote: >-
      The assessments were validated by a panel of educators and DepEd
      officials to ensure alignment with target competencies and
      clarity. A pilot study of 60 students from Metro Manila further
      refined the tests
    explanation: >-
      The study employed custom-developed 21-item assessments aligned
      with the curriculum rather than widely recognized standardized
      exams.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In August 2022, all students in the treatment schools
      received a tablet..." (p. 10)

      2) "The endline survey was administered in May 2024, marking the
      completion of the second academic year during which students had
      access to the tablets." (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention began with tablet distribution in August 2022.
      Outcome measurements (endline survey) were collected in May
      2024. This duration spans approximately 21 months (almost two
      full academic years). The criterion requires a minimum duration
      of one full academic term (~3-4 months). Since the interval is
      nearly two years, it far exceeds the minimum requirement.

      Criterion T is met because the intervention and tracking period
      lasted significantly longer than one academic term.
    quote: >-
      The endline survey was administered in May 2024, marking the
      completion of the second academic year during which students had
      access to the tablets.
    explanation: >-
      The study tracked outcomes from August 2022 to May 2024, covering
      almost two full academic years.
    met: true

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Within each pair, one school was randomly assigned to
      participate in the program ('treatment' schools) while the other
      was assigned to the 'control' school group..." (p. 10)

      2) "Table 1 also checks for baseline balance across 11 parental,
      household, and student characteristics. All of these parental,
      household and student characteristics are balanced at baseline..."
      (p. 11)

      3) "Control" column in Table 1 lists specific demographics
      (Mother's education, devices, electricity, etc.) and baseline
      test scores. (p. 16)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper provides a clear documentation of the control group.
      Table 1 explicitly lists the characteristics of the control group
      ("Control" column) including sample size (N=264 at baseline),
      mother's education, asset ownership, and baseline test scores.
      The text confirms that control schools were paired based on size
      and that baseline characteristics were balanced. The control
      condition is described as the prevailing context (paper-based
      modules/limited face-to-face) without the tablet intervention.

      Criterion D is met because the characteristics and conditions of
      the control group are well-documented and presented in comparison
      tables.
    quote: >-
      Table 1 also checks for baseline balance across 11 parental,
      household, and student characteristics. All of these parental,
      household and student characteristics are balanced at baseline
    explanation: >-
      The control group's baseline characteristics, including
      demographics and test scores, are fully documented and compared
      in Table 1.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "At the baseline, schools were paired within divisions based
      on similar sizes. Within each pair, one school was randomly
      assigned to participate in the program ('treatment' schools)
      while the other was assigned to the 'control' school group..."
      (p. 10)

      2) "Because the treatment was assigned at the school level... we
      carry out regression analyses accounting for group-level
      dependencies by clustering standard errors at the school level..."
      (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study randomly assigned the intervention at the school level
      (21 treatment vs 21 control schools). This meets the requirement
      for a School-level RCT, which is designed to prevent contamination
      and reflect real-world implementation units. The analysis also
      accounts for this clustering.

      Criterion S is met because the unit of randomization was
      explicitly the school.
    quote: >-
      Within each pair, one school was randomly assigned to participate
      in the program ('treatment' schools) while the other was assigned
      to the 'control' school group
    explanation: >-
      The study randomized 42 schools into treatment and control
      groups, satisfying the school-level randomization criterion.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Together with the Department of Education, we conducted a
      42-school randomized controlled trial..." (p. 4)

      2) "David A. Raitzer (draitzer@adb.org) is a senior economist...
      and Milan Thomas (mthomas@adb.org) is a country economist...
      Asian Development Bank." (p. 2)

      3) "The study also would not have been possible without the
      implementation efforts of ADB colleagues... The pilot activities
      were supported... financed... through the Asian Development Bank"
      (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires the study to be conducted independently
      from the intervention designers/implementers. Here, the authors
      include staff from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which
      funded, supported ("implementation efforts of ADB colleagues"),
      and helped conduct the trial ("Together with DepEd, we
      conducted..."). The authors are evaluating a project implemented
      by their own organization. There is no statement of an independent
      external evaluation team conducting the analysis.

      Criterion I is not met because the authors are affiliated with
      the organization that designed and implemented the intervention.
    quote: >-
      The study also would not have been possible without the
      implementation efforts of ADB colleagues...
    explanation: >-
      The study was conducted by authors affiliated with the Asian
      Development Bank, which also funded and supported the
      implementation of the intervention.

      2) "The endline survey was administered in May 2024, marking the
      completion of the second academic year during which students had
      access to the tablets." (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study tracks the intervention and outcomes over a period
      spanning two academic years (2022-2023 and 2023-2024). This
      satisfies the requirement for the study to last at least one full
      academic year.

      Criterion Y is met because the tracking period covered two full
      academic years.
    quote: >-
      The endline survey was administered in May 2024, marking the
      completion of the second academic year during which students had
      access to the tablets.
    explanation: >-
      The intervention and data collection spanned two full academic
      years, exceeding the one-year requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The intervention provided selected junior high school
      students with low-cost tablets, complemented by installing
      antennae to establish local area networks..." (p. 8)

      2) "Hypothesis 1) Provision of tablets and digitized learning
      modules... will increase student performance... relative to a
      baseline context of instruction via paper-based modules." (p. 9)

      3) "To supplement the prevailing remote learning environment,
      students in treated schools were provided tablets..." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention group received additional resources (tablets,
      LAN, solar panels) compared to the control group which relied on
      paper-based modules. Usually, this would be a failure of the
      Balanced Resources criterion. However, the standard allows for an
      exception if the intervention "explicitly tests the impact of
      additional resources... as the primary treatment variable." Here,
      the explicit hypothesis is testing the "Provision of tablets and
      digitized learning modules" against the baseline instruction. The
      provision of the hardware/technology *is* the treatment being
      evaluated. Therefore, the control group receiving the standard
      "business as usual" without these extra resources is consistent
      with the study's design intent.

      Criterion B is met because the study explicitly tests the
      provision of additional technological resources as the primary
      treatment variable.
    quote: >-
      Provision of tablets and digitized learning modules (DLMs)...
      will increase student performance... relative to a baseline
      context of instruction via paper-based modules.
    explanation: >-
      The study explicitly tests the provision of hardware and software
      resources (tablets and modules) as the primary treatment,
      justifying the resource difference with the control group.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study presented in this paper tests whether educational
      technology in the form of computer-assisted instruction (CAI)
      could help..." (p. 6)

      2) "This study illustrates both the promise and perils of using
      CAI..." (p. 25)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The "Learning at the Last Mile" study evaluates a specific pilot
      project in the Philippines. A search for independent replications
      of this specific tablet intervention in Philippine "Last Mile
      Schools" by other research teams yielded no results in
      peer-reviewed journals. The references cited within the paper are
      related studies, but not replications of this specific protocol.

      Criterion R is not met because no independent replication of this
      specific trial is reported.
    quote: null
    explanation: >-
      This is an original study and no independent replication of this
      specific intervention is reported.

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The evaluation focuses on monitoring student outcomes in math
      and English assessments..." (p. 8)

      2) "A total of 249 DLMs were developed... across English, math
      and science..." (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard for 'All-subject Exams' requires measuring
      impact on all main subjects. While the intervention materials
      (DLMs) included Science ("English, math and science"), the study
      only assessed outcomes in Math and English. Science was not
      measured. Furthermore, this criterion requires that the
      assessments be standardized (Criterion E met). Since Criterion E
      was not met (custom tests), Criterion A is automatically not met.

      Criterion A is not met because only two subjects were tested
      despite materials covering three, and standard exams were not
      used.
    quote: >-
      The evaluation focuses on monitoring student outcomes in math and
      English assessments
    explanation: >-
      The study measured only Math and English outcomes, excluding
      Science which was part of the intervention content, and failed
      the standardized exam prerequisite.
    met: false

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "By 2024, students who were in Grades 9 and 10 at baseline had
      graduated from junior high school, and thus, endline data
      collection by DepEd was restricted to students who were in Grades
      7 and 8 at baseline..." (p. 8)

      2) "This report focuses on that subset of students and learning
      progression between early 2022 and mid-2024." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires tracking participants until their
      graduation. The study explicitly excluded the older cohorts
      (Grade 9 and 10 at baseline) from the endline specifically
      *because* they had graduated. For the younger cohorts (Grade 7
      and 8 at baseline), the study tracked them until Grades 9 and 10.
      A search for follow-up papers tracking the younger cohort to
      graduation yielded no results, which is expected given the recent
      publication date (Dec 2025).

      Criterion G is not met because the study ceased data collection
      for students who graduated and did not report graduation outcomes.
    quote: >-
      endline data collection by DepEd was restricted to students who
      were in Grades 7 and 8 at baseline... [students] in Grades 9 and
      10 at baseline had graduated
    explanation: >-
      The study stopped tracking students once they graduated and did
      not collect or report graduation data.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We identified 42 eligible schools for the tablet intervention
      pilot using a list..." (p. 10)

      2) "Together with the Department of Education, we conducted a
      42-school randomized controlled trial..." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      A search of the AEA RCT Registry and other standard databases for
      pre-registration of the "Learning at the Last Mile" Philippines
      study by Glewwe et al. or ADB did not yield a specific registry
      entry or protocol published prior to the intervention start
      (2022). The paper itself does not cite a pre-registration number
      (e.g., AEARCTR-XXXX).

      Criterion P is not met because there is no evidence or citation
      of a pre-registered study protocol.
    quote: null
    explanation: >-
      The paper does not provide any reference to a pre-registered
      study protocol or registry ID.
