abstract: >-
  This mixed methods experimental study examined the impacts of the Early
  College High School model on students' college readiness in mathematics
  measured by their success in college preparatory mathematics courses in the
  9th through 11th grades, and disaggregated for academically prepared and
  underprepared students. This study looked at the longitudinal sample of
  students who moved from the 9th through 11th grade both in the treatment and
  control groups. The results show that the reform is having statistically
  significant and substantively important impacts on students' course-taking and
  success for both prepared and underprepared students. The impacts of this
  whole school reform are larger for underprepared students. The results
  demonstrate that the ECHS reform model is being successful in implementing a
  universal algebra policy and rigorous college preparation curriculum with
  students of diverse backgrounds: 38% underrepresented in college minority, 46%
  low income, and 38% first generation college-goers, and despite of their
  academic preparedness levels. The analyses of classroom observations and
  interviews with mathematics teachers reveal that instruction in the ECHS
  displays a mix of traditional approaches and rigorous student-centered
  instructional practices. These results are discussed in the context of debates
  on benefits and disadvantages of universal algebra policies and
  student-centered instruction for academically underprepared students.

      The study randomized individual students via admissions lotteries, not
      classes or schools.
    quote: >-
      "Participating schools agreed to use a lottery to select students, and the
      study is tracking outcomes for students randomly accepted into the
      program (treatment) and those not accepted who enrolled in some other
      school in the state, typically in the same district (control)." (p. 18)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Participating schools agreed to use a lottery to select students, and
      the study is tracking outcomes for students randomly accepted into the
      program (treatment) and those not accepted who enrolled in some other
      school in the state, typically in the same district (control)." (p. 18)

      2) "In this paper, we include results from analyses completed on a
      longitudinal sample of 1,434 treatment and 995 control students who
      applied to 19 early colleges for the fall of 2005 through 2009." (p. 19)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires class-level (or stronger school-level) randomization,
      unless the intervention is personal tutoring. Here, students apply to
      Early College High Schools and are assigned by lottery at the individual
      student level (treatment = accepted; control = not accepted). The paper
      does not describe random assignment of whole classes or whole schools.

      Even though assignment to different schools can reduce within-classroom
      contamination, the ERCT criterion is about the unit of randomization, and
      the paper explicitly states student-level lottery assignment.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is not met because randomization
      occurred at the student level, not at the class or school level.

      Outcomes are measured via course take-up and course passing, not via a
      standardized exam score.
    quote: >-
      "For each course, we report two outcomes: the percentage of all students
      in the grade in our sample who have taken the course (take-up) and the
      percentage of all students in the grade (not only those who have taken
      the course) who have passed the course (progress)." (p. 25)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "For each course, we report two outcomes: the percentage of all students
      in the grade in our sample who have taken the course (take-up) and the
      percentage of all students in the grade (not only those who have taken
      the course) who have passed the course (progress)." (p. 25)

      2) "Students’ academic performance in mathematics was tracked through
      student-level data collected by the North Carolina Department of Public
      Instruction and housed at the North Carolina Education Research Data
      Center." (p. 20)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized exam-based assessments that are widely
      recognized (not course grades or other non-standardized measures). The
      paper’s primary reported outcomes are course take-up and course progress
      (passing), which are not presented as standardized exam scores.

      While the paper uses state administrative data, it does not report a
      standardized test instrument as the primary outcome for the intervention
      impacts in grades 9-11, and it operationalizes success as passing courses.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is not met because the main
      outcomes are course-taking and course passing rather than standardized
      exam scores.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes are measured across multiple grade levels (9th-11th), exceeding
      the one-term follow-up requirement.

      "This mixed methods experimental study examined the impacts of the Early
      College High School model on students’ college readiness in mathematics as

      2) "Table 3 shows the results for 9th grade, 10th grade, and 11th grade
      mathematics outcomes for the longitudinal sample of students." (p. 25)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that outcomes be measured at least one academic term
      after the intervention begins. The paper reports outcomes for grades 9, 10,
      and 11 (a multi-year window), which necessarily includes at least one term
      of follow-up after program start.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met because outcomes are
      measured over grades 9-11, far exceeding one term.

      The paper documents the control group’s composition and baseline
      characteristics using a detailed characteristics table and narrative.
    quote: >-

      3) "Table 1. Longitudinal Sample Characteristics, by Treatment Status"
      (pp. 19-20)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control group be well-documented, including
      size and baseline characteristics. The paper specifies the control group
      size (995) and presents a dedicated table of characteristics by treatment
      status (Table 1), alongside narrative discussion of baseline differences.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because the paper provides
      both narrative and tabular documentation of the control group and baseline
      characteristics.

      Randomization is done via student admission lotteries, not by randomizing

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level randomization (schools assigned to
      treatment vs control). The paper describes lotteries used to select
      students into Early College schools, which is student-level randomization.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is not met because the unit of
      randomization is students rather than schools.

      The intervention model is supported by a separate organization, while the
      study is conducted by researchers affiliated with research institutions.
    quote: >-
      "As implemented in North Carolina, U.S. (where this study was conducted),
      ECHS were guided by the six Design Principles developed by North Carolina
      New Schools, the non-profit organization supporting the implementation of

      Relevant Quotes:

      ECHS were guided by the six Design Principles developed by North Carolina
      New Schools, the non-profit organization supporting the implementation of

      2) "This material is based upon work supported by the Institute of Education
      Sciences under grant number #R305R060022." (p. 42)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the evaluation be conducted independently from
      the intervention designers. The paper identifies North Carolina New Schools
      as the non-profit supporting the model’s implementation, and the study is
      presented as an IES-funded research effort rather than an internal program
      self-evaluation by North Carolina New Schools.

      The paper does not explicitly state an arms-length governance structure,
      but the described roles separate the implementation-support organization
      (North Carolina New Schools) from the research study reporting results.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is met because the model’s
      implementation-support organization is distinct from the IES-funded study
      team reporting the evaluation.

      The paper reports outcomes spanning grades 9-11, satisfying a one-year
      duration requirement.
    quote: >-
      "Table 3 shows the results for 9th grade, 10th grade, and 11th grade
      mathematics outcomes for the longitudinal sample of students." (p. 25)

      2) "Table 3 shows the results for 9th grade, 10th grade, and 11th grade
      mathematics outcomes for the longitudinal sample of students." (p. 25)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcomes to be measured at least one academic year
      after intervention start. Reporting outcomes across grades 9-11 implies
      multi-year measurement well beyond one year.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is met because outcomes are
      measured across multiple academic years (grades 9-11).

    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention is explicitly described as a comprehensive reform model
      whose supports and resource-intensive elements are integral to what is
      being tested.
    quote: >-
      "ECHS is a comprehensive reform model. It is purposefully designed to
      include multiple elements that are believed to work best together to
      ensure students’ success in college preparatory and college level courses."
      (p. 39)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In addition to extensive tutoring, often provided by ECHS teachers to
      struggling students, academic supports in ECHS were integrated into the
      school day, both during and outside of regular instructional time..."
      (p. 10)

      2) "These Design Principles include: (1) a focus on college readiness...
      (3) a personalized learning environment with strong staff-student
      relationships and academic and social supports for students; ... and (6)
      use of time, resources and structures to support the other principles,
      including a small school size of less than 400 students and flexible
      scheduling." (p. 7)

      3) "ECHS is a comprehensive reform model. It is purposefully designed to
      include multiple elements that are believed to work best together to
      ensure students’ success in college preparatory and college level courses."
      (p. 39)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B asks whether the intervention provides additional time/budget/
      resources to treatment students without a comparable substitute in the
      control condition, unless the additional resources are integral to the
      treatment being tested.

      The paper describes resource-intensive elements (tutoring integrated into
      the school day, small school size, and broad supports) as part of the
      ECHS design principles and explicitly frames ECHS as a comprehensive model
      intended to work "together" as the tested package. In this framing, the
      additional resources are not incidental add-ons; they are core components
      of the intervention definition.

      Under the ERCT decision rule for criterion B, when additional resources
      are integral to the intervention being tested (a comprehensive school
      model), the control group can remain business-as-usual by design, and B
      can be marked met, provided the resource intensity is explicitly surfaced
      in the analysis (as done here).

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met because the paper defines
      the intervention as a comprehensive model whose additional supports and
      resource structures are integral to what is being tested.

      Independent researchers (AIR) report a follow-up study of Early Colleges
      based on admission lotteries, providing replication evidence for the model.
    quote: >-
      "Following up on a previous impact study of Early Colleges (EC) based
      on retrospective admission lotteries, this study assessed longer-term
      impacts on students’ postsecondary outcomes with 4 more years of
      data." (Song et al., 2021, p. 1)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Following up on a previous impact study of Early Colleges (EC) based
      on retrospective admission lotteries, this study assessed longer-term
      impacts on students’ postsecondary outcomes with 4 more years of
      data." (Song et al., 2021, p. 1)

      2) "The study found that students who won EC admission lotteries were
      significantly more likely to enroll in college, enroll in 2-year colleges,
      complete a college degree, complete associate’s degrees or certificates,
      and complete bachelor’s degrees within 6 years after expected high school
      graduation than control students." (Song et al., 2021, p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent reproduction by a different research
      team. This working paper’s authors are not part of AIR, while the cited
      follow-up study is authored by researchers at the American Institutes for
      Research (AIR) and reports lottery-based impact findings for Early
      Colleges.

      The AIR study uses admission lotteries and reports longer-term impacts,
      providing replication evidence (in a different sample and research team)
      that the Early College model yields positive impacts on key educational
      outcomes.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is met because an independent
      research team (AIR) reports lottery-based impact evidence consistent with
      the Early College model’s effects.

    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study reports mathematics course outcomes only and does not use
      standardized exam outcomes across all core subjects.
    quote: >-
      "This mixed methods experimental study examined the impacts of the study
      examined the impacts of the Early College High School model on students’

      2) "Table 3 shows the results for 9th grade, 10th grade, and 11th grade
      mathematics outcomes for the longitudinal sample of students." (p. 25)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires exam-based assessment across all main subjects and
      depends on criterion E being met. Criterion E is not met because the main
      outcomes are course take-up and passing rather than standardized exam
      scores. Independently, the outcomes reported here are limited to
      mathematics course outcomes and do not cover all main subjects.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because the study does
      not satisfy exam-based assessment and does not measure outcomes across all
      core subjects.

    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Follow-up publications by the same research program report high school
      graduation outcomes and longer-term outcomes after high school.
    quote: >-
      "The early college model in North Carolina (one of the states to most
      fully embrace the model) has been the subject of a 14-year longitudinal

      the high school and postsecondary levels." (Edmunds et al., 2020, p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      (p. 9)

      2) "The early college model in North Carolina (one of the states to most
      fully embrace the model) has been the subject of a 14-year longitudinal

      3) "They also had higher attendance, fewer suspensions, and were more
      likely to graduate from high school than students in the control group..."
      (Edmunds et al., 2020, p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants through graduation, and it can
      be satisfied via subsequent publications by the same authors. The working
      paper itself points to an "18-year longitudinal experimental study" and
      explicitly references outcomes "six years after graduating from high
      school," indicating graduation-tracking exists in the broader study
      program.

      In Edmunds et al. (2020), which includes Arshavsky as a co-author, the
      authors describe a multi-year longitudinal experimental study and report
      that early college students were "more likely to graduate from high
      school" than control students. This directly supports that the research
      program tracked students to (and through) the graduation milestone.

      Because criterion Y is met in this paper and the broader study program
      includes graduation tracking evidence, criterion G is met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is met because follow-up work by
      the same research program reports high school graduation outcomes and
      post-high-school follow-up.

      No public pre-registration record (with a registration date prior to study
      start) is identified in the paper or via registry searches.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This material is based upon work supported by the Institute of
      Education Sciences under grant number #R305R060022." (p. 42)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires a publicly accessible pre-registered protocol with a
      registration date before data collection starts. The paper provides an
      IES grant number but does not provide any registry link or registration
      identifier (for example, OSF, AEA RCT Registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, or an
      equivalent).

      After searching for registrations linked to the study and grant number,
      no public pre-registration record that clearly matches this specific
      lottery-based study and predates study start was found.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is not met because no evidence of
      a pre-registered protocol is provided or discoverable in public registries.
