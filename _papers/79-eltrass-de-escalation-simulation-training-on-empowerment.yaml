  Background Patient aggression is a persistent challenge in
  mental health settings, and undergraduate preparation in
  de-escalation remains variable. This study evaluated whether a
  standardized-patient (SP) de-escalation simulation improves
  psychological empowerment and confidence in coping with
  aggression among psychiatric nursing students.

  Methods We conducted a parallel-group randomized controlled
  trial (pretest–posttest) with undergraduate psychiatric nursing
  students randomly assigned to either an SP-based de-escalation
  simulation program or routine curriculum control. The
  intervention comprised 12 sessions over 8 weeks (4 theory + 8
  SP practical scenarios with structured debriefs aligned to
  INACSL standards). Primary outcomes were psychological
  empowerment and confidence in coping with patient aggression,
  assessed at baseline and immediately post-intervention using
  validated scales. Fidelity was supported through scripted
  scenarios, SP calibration, and facilitator adherence/debrief
  quality checks. Between-group differences in change scores were
  examined.

  Results Compared with the control group, students in the
  simulation arm demonstrated significantly greater gains in both
  psychological empowerment and confidence in coping with
  aggression from pretest to posttest. Fidelity indices indicated
  consistent SP portrayal and facilitator adherence across
  sessions, and attendance was high. No adverse events were
  reported.

  Conclusions A structured de-escalation simulation using trained
  standardized patients significantly improves empowerment and
  confidence among psychiatric nursing students. The scenario
  maps, learning outcomes, and debriefing approach described
  support replication and curriculum integration in undergraduate
  mental health nursing. Future work should examine longer-term
  retention, transfer to clinical practice, and curriculum-level
  outcomes.

      Randomization was at the individual student level rather
      than assigning whole classes (and this was not a one-to-one
      tutoring intervention).

      University, located in Giza Governorate, Egypt." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT C criterion requires random assignment at the class
      level (or stronger), unless the intervention is explicitly
      one-to-one tutoring/personal teaching. The paper describes
      a "parallel-group randomized controlled trial" where
      "Participants were allocated 1:1" to conditions, which
      indicates individual-level randomization of students rather
      than random assignment of intact classes.

      The intervention is a group-based course component (SP
      simulations delivered as sessions), not a one-to-one
      tutoring exception.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion C is not met because the
      study randomized individual students rather than whole
      classes (and no tutoring exception applies).

      4) "Clinical confidence in coping with patient aggression
      questionnaire (CCWPA)..." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT E criterion requires standardized exam-based
      assessments (e.g., state/national standardized tests or
      widely recognized standardized achievement exams). This
      study assesses outcomes using two questionnaire instruments
      (PES and CCWPA) administered as self-report measures.

      While these instruments may be "validated scales," they are
      not standardized exam-based academic assessments of
      educational achievement (and the paper does not describe
      use of national/state exams or other standardized testing
      programs).

      Final summary sentence: Criterion E is not met because the
      study uses self-report validated scales (PES and CCWPA),
      not standardized exam-based assessments.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention lasted 8 weeks and outcomes were measured
      immediately after training, which is shorter than a full
      academic term (about 3–4 months) from start to measurement.
    quote: >-
      "Immediately after the training, post-intervention data
      were collected from both groups..." (p. 5)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The intervention comprised 12 sessions over 8 weeks..."
      (p. 1)

      2) "Immediately after the training, post-intervention data
      were collected from both groups using the same tools."
      (p. 5)

      3) "Data collection was carried out... during the Fall
      semester of the academic year 2023–2024..." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT T criterion requires that outcomes be measured at
      least one full academic term after the intervention begins.
      The paper explicitly states the intervention lasted "8
      weeks" and that evaluation occurred "Immediately after the
      training."

      Eight weeks is substantially shorter than a typical academic
      term (~12–16 weeks). The paper does not describe an
      additional later follow-up measurement at or beyond a term
      after the start date.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion T is not met because the
      study measured outcomes immediately after an 8-week program,
      which is shorter than one academic term from start to
      measurement.
  d:

      The control condition is clearly described (routine
      curriculum without simulation) and baseline characteristics
      and group sizes are documented.

      psychiatric nursing students, distributed equally into
      experimental (n = 40) and control (n = 40) groups." (p. 6)

      6) "Table 1 presents the socio-demographic characteristics
      of the nursing students in both the experimental and
      control groups." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT D requires a well-documented control group including
      what they received and baseline/demographic information.
      This paper provides a detailed narrative description of the
      control curriculum (topics, contact hours, teaching methods,
      and the explicit absence of simulation/role-play) and also
      documents sample size by arm and baseline characteristics
      via Table 1.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion D is met because the
      control condition and its instruction are described in
      detail and baseline group characteristics and sizes are
      reported.
  s:

    explanation: >-
      The paper randomizes students within a single university
      department rather than randomizing at the school/site level.

      2) "Participants were allocated 1:1 to the experimental...
      or control... arm using a computer-generated random
      sequence..." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT S requires school-level randomization among schools or
      equivalent institutions/sites. The paper describes one
      institutional setting (October 6 University) and describes
      allocation of participants 1:1, which indicates student-level
      allocation rather than school/site-level randomization.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion S is not met because the
      study does not randomize schools/sites, only individual
      students in one institution.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Although randomization and assessment roles include
      "independent" personnel, the intervention was developed and
      data collection led by study authors, so the trial is not
      fully independent of the intervention designers.
    quote: >-
      "GAE conceived the study, developed the simulation training,
      and led data collection." (p. 10)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A computer-generated random sequence was prepared by an
      independent faculty member..." (p. 3)

      2) "Outcome assessors and data analysts were independent of
      the teaching team..." (p. 3)

      3) "GAE conceived the study, developed the simulation
      training, and led data collection." (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT I requires that the study be conducted independently
      from the authors who designed the intervention (to reduce
      bias in implementation and analysis).

      The paper includes partial independence safeguards: an
      "independent faculty member" prepared the random sequence,
      and "Outcome assessors and data analysts" were independent
      of the teaching team. However, the author contributions
      state that an author (GAE) "developed the simulation
      training" and "led data collection," which indicates that
      key conduct of the study was not fully separated from the
      intervention designer(s).

      Final summary sentence: Criterion I is not met because the
      intervention designer (an author) led data collection even
      though some roles (random sequence, assessors/analysts) were
      described as independent.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Year-duration tracking is not present because outcomes were
      measured immediately after an 8-week intervention (and ERCT
      Y also cannot be met when ERCT T is not met).
    quote: >-
      "Immediately after the training, post-intervention data
      were collected from both groups..." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The intervention comprised 12 sessions over 8 weeks..."
      (p. 1)

      2) "Immediately after the training, post-intervention data
      were collected from both groups using the same tools."
      (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Y requires outcomes measured at least 75% of an
      academic year after the intervention begins. The study
      describes an 8-week intervention with immediate post-test
      measurement, which is far shorter than an academic year.

      Additionally, per the ERCT instructions provided, if
      criterion T is not met then criterion Y is not met; here T
      is not met because the start-to-measurement interval is
      shorter than a term.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion Y is not met because the
      study’s start-to-measurement period is only 8 weeks with an
      immediate post-test, far short of year-long tracking.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention’s added materials and personnel (trained
      standardized patients, scripted scenarios, debriefing and
      fidelity procedures) are integral to the treatment being
      tested, and the paper documents a structured routine
      curriculum control rather than leaving control students
      without educational engagement.
    quote: >-
      "The control arm received the routine curriculum without
      simulation... The intervention comprised 12 sessions over 8
      weeks (4 theory + 8 SP practical scenarios...)." (p. 1)

      Relevant Quotes:

      2) "The intervention comprised 12 sessions over 8 weeks (4
      theory + 8 SP practical scenarios with structured debriefs
      aligned to INACSL standards)." (p. 1)

      3) "Students in the control arm completed the standard
      psychiatric nursing course content without simulation or
      role-play. The curriculum comprised 12 contact hours..."
      (p. 3)

      4) "Fidelity measures included use of scripted cue cards,
      props, timing windows, and SP calibration workshops."
      (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B focuses on whether time/budget/resources are
      balanced across conditions unless the extra resources are
      explicitly integral to (and intended as) the treatment
      variable.

      Here, the experimental condition is explicitly defined as an
      SP-based simulation program, which inherently requires
      additional resources (standardized patients, simulation
      setup, scripted scenarios, structured debriefing, and
      fidelity monitoring). These resources are not optional add-
      ons; they constitute the intervention being tested.

      The control condition is not a "no-education" group; it is a
      structured routine curriculum with defined content and "12
      contact hours," indicating comparable ongoing educational
      engagement rather than an empty baseline.

      While the paper does not provide a direct minute-by-minute
      equivalence comparison of total contact time across arms,
      the key resource differences (SP simulation infrastructure)
      are integral to the treatment definition, not an unintended
      imbalance.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion B is met because the
      resource-intensive elements are integral to the simulation
      intervention being tested and the control group is given a
      clearly specified routine curriculum rather than lacking
      educational inputs.
  r:

      The paper does not report an independent replication and no
      independent replication evidence is provided within the
      paper text.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Future research should address these limitations by
      employing multi-site designs... and long-term evaluations..."
      (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT R requires that the study be independently replicated
      by a different research team in a different context and
      published in a peer-reviewed journal.

      The paper does not present itself as a replication of a
      prior trial, does not cite an independent team reproducing
      this exact intervention and design, and only suggests that
      future work should include multi-site designs. No external
      replication studies are identified or quoted within the
      provided paper content.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion R is not met because there
      is no quoted evidence of an independent peer-reviewed
      replication of this specific trial.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      All-subject standardized exams were not used, and because
      ERCT E is not met, ERCT A is automatically not met.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Primary outcomes were psychological empowerment and
      confidence in coping with patient aggression..." (p. 1)

      2) "Three data collection instruments were utilized..."
      (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT A requires standardized exam-based assessment across
      all main subjects, and the provided ERCT instructions state
      that if criterion E is not met then A is not met.

      This paper does not use standardized academic exams at all;
      outcomes are psychological empowerment and confidence
      measured via questionnaires, so E is not met and therefore
      A cannot be met.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion A is not met because the
      study does not use standardized exams (and E is not met,
      which makes A automatically not met).
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study did not track participants to graduation, and
      because ERCT Y is not met, ERCT G is automatically not met.
    quote: >-
      "Second, the study only measured immediate post-intervention
      outcomes and did not include a longitudinal follow-up."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Second, the study only measured immediate
      post-intervention outcomes and did not include a longitudinal
      follow-up." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT G requires follow-up tracking until graduation from the
      relevant educational stage, and the provided ERCT
      instructions state that if criterion Y is not met then G is
      not met.

      The paper explicitly acknowledges it only measured immediate
      post-intervention outcomes and did not include longitudinal
      follow-up, which is incompatible with graduation tracking.
      Also, Y is not met (the study is 8 weeks with immediate
      post-test), so G cannot be met.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion G is not met because there
      is no longitudinal follow-up to graduation and Y is not met.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No pre-registration is provided; the paper explicitly states
      "Clinical trial number Not applicable."
    quote: >-
      "Clinical trial number Not applicable." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Clinical trial number Not applicable." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT P requires a pre-registered protocol with a registry
      reference and timing before data collection begins. The
      paper explicitly indicates there is no trial registration
      number, and no registry link/ID or registration date is
      provided in the text.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion P is not met because the
      study provides no pre-registration ID/date and states the
      clinical trial number is not applicable.
