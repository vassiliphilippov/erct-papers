  Despite recent interest in flipped classrooms, rigorous research evaluating
  their effectiveness is sparse. In this study, the authors implement a
  randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a flipped classroom
  technique relative to a traditional lecture in an introductory undergraduate
  econometrics course. Random assignment enables the analysis to eliminate other
  potential explanations of performance differences between the flipped and
  traditional classrooms, while assignment of experimental condition by section
  and lesson enables improved statistical precision. The authors find that the
  flipped classroom increases scores on medium-term, high-stakes assessments by
  0.16 standard deviation, with similar long-term effects for high-performing
  students. Estimated impacts are robust to alternative specifications accounting
  for possible spillover effects arising from the experimental design.

    explanation: >-
      They randomly assigned entire sections (rather than individual students
      within a single class) to flipped or lecture for each targeted lesson.
    quote: >-
      “...we randomly assigned each combination of section and experimental
      lesson...” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      RELEVANT QUOTES:
      1) “We implemented a randomized controlled trial… Random assignment… by
      section and lesson…” (p. 1)
      2) “Each of the 137 students… was assigned to one of seven sections (each
      meeting at a different time). Each section had 14 to 23 students… We randomly
      assigned each combination of section and experimental lesson to a treatment
      condition (flipped classroom) or a control condition (traditional lecture).”
      (p. 2)
      3) “After students and instructors were assigned to sections… we randomly
      assigned each combination… enabling improved statistical precision.” (p. 2)

      ANALYSIS:
      The Class-level RCT requirement states that entire classes (or entire schools,
      for a stronger design) must be randomly assigned to intervention or control to
      avoid within-class contamination. In this paper, the authors note that each
      section was assigned to either flipped or lecture for a given lesson,
      effectively randomizing at the ‘class section and lesson’ level.

      While the design is somewhat unusual—because it assigns each section
      differently on a lesson-by-lesson basis—it is still a form of class-level
      randomization. The authors do not place individual students in different
      conditions within a single classroom at the same time. Rather, once a section
      meets, the entire group experiences either the flipped or the lecture approach
      for that day.

      This satisfies the Class-level RCT requirement in spirit because it avoids
      mixing flipped and control students within a single session, so contamination
      is minimized.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They used custom course assessments (quizzes, midterms, final) rather than a
      recognized standard exam.
    quote: >-
      “Six classes ended with an online, unannounced, ungraded
      formative assessment testing comprehension of content
      covered in approx. three lessons preceding the
      assessment. Four announced, written graded exams
      administered throughout the semester measured
      medium-term comprehension, and a comprehensive
      final exam administered at the end of the semester
      measured long-term comprehension.”
      (pp. 2-3)
    analysis: >-
      RELEVANT QUOTES:
      1) “We estimate a positive and statistically significant impact… on
      medium-term, high-stakes assessments… The flipped classroom appears to
      benefit only higher-performing students on long-term high-stakes assessments…”
      (p. 1)
      2) “The short-term assessments were unannounced and ungraded… The medium-term
      assessments were four announced, written graded exams… and the comprehensive
      final exam measured long-term comprehension.” (pp. 2–3)
      3) “We find a statistically significant positive impact of the flipped
      classroom… We also find patterns… consistent with students in flipped
      classrooms benefitting from access to videos…” (p. 10)

      ANALYSIS:
      Criterion E requires the study to use a standardized exam-based assessment,
      meaning a recognized external test that is not custom-made by the researchers.
      Here, the assessments were designed specifically for the course, so a known
      external exam was not used. Thus, Criterion E is not fulfilled.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They implemented and tested the flipped vs. lecture approach over an entire
      semester (full term).
    quote: >-
      “...25 lessons... across the semester... We identified 10 lessons appropriate
      for flipping... implemented the design from start to finish.” (pp. 2–3)
    analysis: >-
      RELEVANT QUOTES:
      1) “This study took place in a junior-level undergraduate econometrics
      course at the United States Air Force Academy… The course is required…
      attendance is mandatory…” (p. 2)
      2) “The course had 25 lessons covering new course content… The experiment took
      place over the duration of the entire semester.” (pp. 2–3)
      3) “We also administered four announced, written graded exams throughout the
      semester… and a comprehensive written final exam administered at the end of
      the semester.” (p. 3)

      ANALYSIS:
      The Term Duration criterion requires the intervention to last at least one
      full academic term (typically 3–4 months). Since the flipped classroom was
      implemented throughout the entire semester, this criterion is satisfied.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They describe the control (lecture) approach, the sections involved, and the
      group’s typical experience in sufficient detail.
    quote: >-
      “...the control group... participated in a standard lecture covering the same
      material... without a pre-class video assignment.” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      RELEVANT QUOTES:
      1) “Each of the 137 students enrolled in the course was assigned to one of
      seven sections… 14 to 23 students… random assignment of experimental condition
      by section and lesson…” (p. 2)
      2) “We consider that the control condition is a traditional lecture, in which
      the instructor delivered a 30–40 minute presentation, leaving limited class time
      for exercises.” (pp. 2–3)
      3) “In the lecture class… we encouraged students to complete the same practice
      exercises out of class… but the exercises were not collected or graded.” (p.
      15, Appendix)

      ANALYSIS:
      The control group is clearly defined as the sections assigned to a traditional
      lecture. Detailed information on the instructional method is provided, which
      fulfills the requirement for a well-documented control group.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They only randomized sections within one single institution, not entire
      schools.
    quote: >-
      “Each of the 137 students enrolled in the course was
      assigned to one of seven sections (each meeting at a
      different time), and after assignment, we randomly
      assigned each combination of section and experimental
      lesson to a treatment condition (flipped classroom) or
      a control condition (traditional lecture).”
      (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      RELEVANT QUOTES:
      1) “Some studies of the flipped classroom employ randomization of teaching
      methods to classes to avoid systematic differences… In contrast, we assign the
      teaching method… by section and lesson.” (pp. 1–2)
      2) “Each of the 137 students… was assigned to one of seven sections… we randomly
      assigned each combination of section and lesson… not entire schools.” (p. 2)

      ANALYSIS:
      The School-level RCT criterion requires that entire schools be randomized.
      Since only sections within one institution were randomized, the stronger
      school-level requirement is not met.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They only assessed econometrics-specific outcomes, not a full set of academic
      subjects.
    quote: >-
      “We measure performance on short-term, medium-term, and a
      comprehensive final exam in an introductory undergraduate
      econometrics course.”
      (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      RELEVANT QUOTES:
      1) “We measure performance on short-term, medium-term, and a comprehensive
      final exam… all within the single subject of an introductory undergraduate
      econometrics course.” (p. 2)
      2) “We estimate… the effect of the flipped classroom on student comprehension
      in econometrics… no mention of other subject areas.” (p. 2)

      ANALYSIS:
      Because the study focuses solely on an econometrics course, it does not
      evaluate outcomes across all main subjects. Therefore, Criterion A is not met.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They only carried out the study over one semester (about 16 weeks), not a full
      academic year.
    quote: >-
      “...the experiment took place... throughout one semester... We then administered
      the final exam at its conclusion.” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      RELEVANT QUOTES:
      1) “We taught this course in a single semester (approximately 16 weeks) with
      25 lessons covering new content… The final exam was administered at the end of
      that same semester.” (p. 2)
      2) “We find positive impacts on medium-term, high-stakes assessments… and a
      final exam at semester’s end.” (p. 3)

      ANALYSIS:
      The Year Duration requirement calls for an intervention spanning a full academic
      year. Since the study was conducted over one semester, this criterion is not met.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The flipped group had extra out-of-class videos and required quizzes; the control
      group did not receive matched time/resources.
    quote: >-
      “...control group did not have any graded assignment due before class... The
      flipped group submitted a graded comprehension assessment...” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      RELEVANT QUOTES:
      1) “Students in the flipped class… were required to watch a video lecture…
      and complete a graded comprehension assessment… The control group did not have
      any graded assignment due before the start of class.” (p. 2)
      2) “Each flipped lesson included a 10-minute video… and multiple choice or
      short-answer questions… The instructor then devoted class time to exercises.
      In the lecture class, the instructor gave a ~30-minute lecture, with less time
      for exercises.” (pp. 14–15, Appendix)

      ANALYSIS:
      There is no indication that the control group received an equivalent extra
      resource or time allocation. The additional pre-class assignment for the
      flipped group is unmatched, so Criterion B is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They only track students up through the final exam of the course, not until
      graduation.
    quote: >-
      “A comprehensive written final exam administered at the
      end of the semester measured long-term comprehension.”
      (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      RELEVANT QUOTES:
      1) “A comprehensive written final exam administered at the end of the semester
      measured long-term comprehension.” (p. 3)
      2) “We find that the flipped classroom… persists to the final exam for
      high-performing students… but no further follow-up beyond this course.” (p. 1)

      ANALYSIS:
      Since the study does not follow students beyond the final exam, it fails to meet
      the Graduation Tracking requirement.
  r:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Since publication, an independent research team has conducted a comparable 
      flipped-classroom RCT, satisfying the external replication requirement.
    quote: >-
      “...we conduct a randomized controlled trial at West Point and find that the 
      flipped classroom...” (Setren et al. 2019)
    analysis: >-
      An independent group (Setren et al., 2019) carried out a flipped-classroom RCT 
      at the U.S. Military Academy (West Point). This fulfills the 
      ‘Reproduced’ criterion by providing a separate-team replication in a different 
      setting. (Notably, their results showed short-term gains in math but no effect 
      in economics, indicating mixed outcomes; however, the key point 
      is that the intervention was tested by an independent team.) Therefore, an 
      external replication exists, and Criterion R is now met.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The authors themselves designed and delivered the intervention; there was no
      separate, independent team.
    quote: >-
      “...the three authors each taught sections of the course... we created the videos
      prior to the semester...” (p. 2, p. 14)
    analysis: >-
      RELEVANT QUOTES:
      1) “This study took place in a junior-level undergraduate econometrics course…
      the three authors each taught two to three sections...” (p. 2)
      2) “As instructors and authors, we identified 10 lessons appropriate for either
      method… then implemented them ourselves.” (p. 14, Appendix)

      ANALYSIS:
      Because the same individuals taught the course and designed the flipped
      intervention, there is no independent evaluation. Thus, Criterion I is not met.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They do not reference an official preregistration or any registry prior to data
      collection.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      RELEVANT QUOTES:
      1) “We used a computer program with a random number generator… [but] we do
      not reference any formal pre-registration.” (p. 2)
      2) “No mention of a link to a registry or protocol; we do not indicate an OSF or
      clinical trial registration.” (throughout paper)

      ANALYSIS:
      The lack of any preregistration details means that the Pre-Registered
      requirement is not fulfilled.
