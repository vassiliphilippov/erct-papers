  Despite recent interest in flipped classrooms, rigorous research evaluating
  their effectiveness is sparse. In this study, the authors implement a randomized
  controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a flipped classroom technique
  relative to a traditional lecture in an introductory undergraduate econometrics
  course. Random assignment enables the analysis to eliminate other potential
  explanations of performance differences between the flipped and traditional
  classrooms, while assignment of experimental condition by section and lesson
  enables improved statistical precision. The authors find that the flipped
  classroom increases scores on medium-term, high‑stakes assessments by 0.16
  standard deviation, with similar long‑term effects for high‑performing
  students. Estimated impacts are robust to alternative specifications accounting
  for possible spillover effects arising from the experimental design.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The study randomizes intact sections (all students in a meeting) to flipped or lecture
      for each lesson, avoiding within‑session mixing and satisfying class‑level
      assignment.
    quote: >
      “We randomly assigned each combination of section and experimental lesson to a
      treatment condition (flipped classroom) or a control condition (traditional lecture), conditional on each section having exactly five flipped lessons and each experimental lesson having three or four flipped sections.” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “We implemented a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of
      a flipped classroom technique relative to a traditional lecture in an
      introductory undergraduate econometrics course. Random assignment… by
      section and lesson…” (p. 1)

      2) “Each of the 137 students enrolled in the course was assigned to one of
      seven sections (each meeting at a different time)… We randomly assigned each
      combination of section and experimental lesson to a treatment condition
      (flipped classroom) or a control condition (traditional lecture).” (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The authors never split individual students within a single session into
      different conditions. Instead, for each targeted lesson, an entire section
      either experienced the flipped format or the traditional lecture, thereby
      preventing within‑class contamination and meeting the ERCT requirement
      for class‑level randomization.

      Thus, criterion C is met because entire sections were randomized as intact
      units for each lesson, satisfying the class‑level RCT criterion.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study used instructor‑designed course exams instead of standardized
      external assessments.
    quote: >
      "Four announced, written graded exams administered throughout the semester
      measured medium‑term comprehension on content covered in approximately
      the eight lessons preceding the exam." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Four announced, written graded exams administered throughout the semester
      measured medium‑term comprehension on content covered in approximately the
      eight lessons preceding the exam." (p. 3)

      2) "A comprehensive written final exam administered at the end of the semester
      measured long‑term comprehension." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The assessments are course‑specific exams designed by the instructors, not
      recognized standardized tests. Therefore, they do not satisfy the requirement
      for standardized, exam‑based assessment.

      Therefore, criterion E is not met because the study used custom course exams rather than a recognized standardized assessment.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Learning outcomes were measured at end of semester, satisfying the term
      duration requirement.
    quote: >
      "A comprehensive written final exam administered at the end of the semester
      measured long‑term comprehension." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A comprehensive written final exam administered at the end of the semester
      measured long‑term comprehension." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study measured outcomes at the end of the semester, covering a full
      academic term, satisfying the ERCT term duration requirement.

      Thus, criterion T is met because learning outcomes were assessed at the end of the semester, covering a full academic term.
  d:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The control (lecture) condition lacks detailed documentation of participant
      characteristics and baseline outcomes.
    quote: >
      "Students in lecture lessons had access to the same exercises offered in the
      flipped classes, but the lecture group generally did not have available class
      time to complete the exercises." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students in lecture lessons had access to the same exercises offered in the
      flipped classes, but the lecture group generally did not have available class time
      to complete the exercises." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The quote describes the control condition but does not provide demographic
      details or baseline performance of the control lessons. There is no table or
      narrative describing participant characteristics for lecture lessons separately.
      Therefore, documentation of the control group is insufficient.

      Accordingly, criterion D is not met because the control condition is not described with baseline performance or demographic details.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Randomization occurred within course sections rather than entire schools.
    quote: >
      "After students and instructors were assigned to sections of the course,
      we randomly assigned each combination of section and experimental lesson
      to a treatment condition (flipped classroom) or a control condition
      (traditional lecture)..." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "After students and instructors were assigned to sections of the course,
      we randomly assigned each combination of section and experimental lesson to
      a treatment condition (flipped classroom) or a control condition
      (traditional lecture)..." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomization was performed at the section‑lesson level, not at the school
      level. The ERCT school‑level RCT criterion requires randomisation among
      institutions (schools), which is not satisfied here.

      Consequently, criterion S is not met because randomization did not occur at the school level.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Only econometrics outcomes were assessed, with no broad subject coverage.
    quote: >
      "A comprehensive written final exam administered at the end of the
      semester measured long‑term comprehension." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A comprehensive written final exam administered at the end of the
      semester measured long‑term comprehension." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study focuses exclusively on an econometrics course and does not assess
      learning outcomes across other core subjects. Thus, it fails the all‑subject exams
      requirement.

      Thus, criterion A is not met because the intervention’s impact was measured only in the single subject of econometrics.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Outcomes were measured only through one semester, not a full academic year.
    quote: >
      "A comprehensive written final exam administered at the end of the
      semester measured long‑term comprehension." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A comprehensive written final exam administered at the end of the
      semester measured long‑term comprehension." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      There is no follow‑up beyond the semester final exam. The study does not
      track participants over a full academic year, so the year duration requirement
      is not satisfied.

      As a result, criterion Y is not met because tracking did not extend through a full academic year.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Flipped lessons included mandatory pre‑class videos and in‑class exercises
      not equated by the control group.
    quote: >
      "We assigned students a video lecture and graded comprehension questions
      in advance of each flipped lesson... Students in lecture lessons had access to
      the same exercises offered in the flipped classes, but the lecture group generally
      did not have available class time to complete the exercises." (p. 3–4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We assigned students a video lecture and graded comprehension questions
      in advance of each flipped lesson." (p. 3)

      2) "Students in lecture lessons had access to the same exercises offered in
      the flipped classes, but the lecture group generally did not have available class
      time to complete the exercises." (p. 3–4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The flipped condition required additional preparatory tasks (video lectures and
      comprehension quizzes), while the control condition did not match these resources
      or structured time. This imbalance undermines the ability to isolate the effect of
      the flipping method alone.

      Therefore, criterion B is not met because the flipped lessons introduced extra preparatory tasks not matched in the control lessons.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study did not track participants until graduation.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper reports outcomes only up to the final exam at semester end.
      No data collection continues through graduation, so graduation tracking
      criterion is not satisfied.

      Thus, criterion G is not met because no follow‑up beyond the semester final exam is reported.
  r:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      An independent replication of the flipped classroom experiment by another research team has been published, satisfying this criterion.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We conduct a randomized controlled trial at West Point and find that the flipped classroom produced short term gains in Math
      and no effect in Economics..." (Setren et al. 2021)

      Detailed Analysis:

      A separate research team (Setren et al., 2021) conducted an independent randomized trial implementing a flipped classroom model at a different institution. This external replication demonstrates that the flipped classroom approach can be reproduced in another context, although the outcomes varied by subject (positive in mathematics but null in economics). Thus, criterion R is met as the flipped classroom experiment was independently replicated by an external research team.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Authors who designed the intervention also implemented and analyzed the study.
    quote: >
      "Each of the 137 students enrolled in the course was assigned to one of seven
      sections (each meeting at a different time)... The three authors each taught two to
      three sections of the course." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Each of the 137 students enrolled in the course was assigned to one of
      seven sections (each meeting at a different time)... The three authors each
      taught two to three sections of the course." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The same individuals who designed the course materials and videos also conducted
      the lessons and evaluated outcomes. No third‑party evaluator participated.

      Therefore, criterion I is not met because the study was conducted by its own authors without independent oversight.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      No evidence of pre-registration of study protocols.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None.

      Detailed Analysis:

      There is no mention of study registration or pre-published protocol before
      data collection. The criterion for pre-registration is therefore not met.

      Thus, criterion P is not met because no pre-registration is reported.
