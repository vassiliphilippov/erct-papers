abstract: >-
  Background With the introduction of the new dental licensing
  regulations (ZApprO) in Germany, preclinical teaching time was
  substantially reduced, particularly affecting practical training. To
  support students’ learning under these conditions, a formative
  Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) was implemented
  early in the preclinical curriculum. This study aimed to evaluate
  the impact of an early formative OSCE on undergraduate dental
  students’ learning behavior, self-assessment, and exam preparation.

  Methods A total of 71 undergraduate dental students (mean age 22
  years) participated voluntarily in a formative OSCE in preventive
  dentistry during the summer semester 2022 and winter semester 2022/23.
  Students were randomly assigned to an intervention group (OSCE
  halfway through the semester) or a control group (OSCE shortly before
  the final exam). The OSCE included five stations developed according
  to the National Competence-Based Learning Objectives Catalog for
  Dentistry. Students completed pseudonymized questionnaires at two
  time points (T0: after OSCE; T1: after the final exam). The
  questionnaire assessed learning behavior (including strategies for
  dealing with difficult material and use of additional resources),
  self-assessment (perceived learning status and exam readiness),
  motivation, and exam preparation. Statistical analyses were performed
  using Mann–Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests.

  Results Participation in the formative OSCE enabled students to
  better evaluate their learning status and identify individual
  learning needs for the final exam. Although both groups started exam
  preparation at similar times (T0: p=0.422; T1: p=0.674), the
  intervention group reported higher initial motivation and greater
  awareness of knowledge gaps after the OSCE. Differences were also
  observed in how students dealt with difficult material and in their
  use of supplementary learning resources.

  Conclusions An early formative OSCE fosters undergraduate dental
  students’ self-assessment, reflection on learning behavior, and
  awareness of learning needs, thereby supporting more targeted exam
  preparation. However, it does not necessarily lead to an earlier
  start of study activities. Implementing formative OSCEs in the middle
  of the semester, accompanied by structured feedback, may further
  enhance their educational impact.

    explanation: >-
      Randomization was at the individual student level (within one
      course cohort), not at the class or school level, and no tutoring
      exception applies.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students were randomly assigned to an intervention group (OSCE
      halfway through the semester) or a control group (OSCE shortly
      before the final exam)." (p. 1 of 8)

      2) "Students were randomly assigned to two groups." (p. 2 of 8)

      3) "The preventive dentistry lecture series in the second
      preclinical semester at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz served
      as the study setting." (p. 2 of 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion C requires randomization at the class level (or
      stronger, e.g., school-level) to reduce contamination across
      students who share instruction and social learning environments.

      The paper describes a single course setting (one lecture series at
      one university) and states that students were randomized to two
      timing conditions. There is no indication that intact classes,
      course sections, or schools were randomized.

      The tutoring/personal-teaching exception does not apply because
      the intervention is not one-to-one tutoring; it is a change in the
      timing of a formative OSCE within a cohort.

      Final: Criterion C is not met because randomization occurred at
      the individual student level, not the class (or school) level.

      Outcomes were measured via self-report questionnaires (and the
      OSCE was ungraded with no recorded scores), not via standardized
      exam-based assessment outcomes.

      3) "Items on learning strategies were based on the validated LIST
      questionnaire [6], while items on exam preparation, motivation,
      and perceived learning status were developed specifically for this
      study and pretested for clarity." (p. 2 of 8)

      4) "As the OSCE was implemented as a formative, ungraded
      assessment, no performance scores were recorded for analytical
      purposes, and students did not receive individual results.
      Therefore, no correlation with final exam grades was possible."
      (p. 2 of 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion E requires that the study uses standardized,
      exam-based assessments as outcome measures (i.e., objective exam
      outcomes, not bespoke/self-report instruments).

      Here, the outcomes are collected using questionnaires (including
      study-specific items), and the OSCE is explicitly ungraded with no
      recorded performance scores used in analysis. The paper does not
      report standardized exam score outcomes as the study endpoints.

      Final: Criterion E is not met because the measured outcomes are
      questionnaire-based and OSCE performance outcomes were not
      recorded/analyzed as standardized exam results.

  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention-to-outcome interval is within the same semester
      (week 7 OSCE vs week 12 final exam), which is shorter than a full
      academic term follow-up from intervention onset.
    quote: >-
      "The intervention group (IG) completed a formative OSCE halfway
      through the semester (week 7), while the control group (CG)
      completed the OSCE in week 11, shortly before the final exam in
      preventive dentistry (week 12)." (p. 2 of 8)

      through the semester (week 7), while the control group (CG)
      completed the OSCE in week 11, shortly before the final exam in

      2) "Data were collected using two structured, pseudonymized
      questionnaires administered at two time points (T0: directly after
      the OSCE; T1: after the final exam)." (p. 2 of 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion T requires that outcomes are measured at least one
      full academic term after the intervention begins (typically about
      3-4 months).

      In this study, the experimental manipulation is the timing of the
      OSCE. For the intervention group, the OSCE occurs in week 7 and
      the later measurement point is after the final exam in week 12.
      This implies roughly five weeks between the intervention (early
      OSCE) and the later outcome measurement.

      The paper does not document a term-length follow-up window from
      the intervention timing to outcome measurement; rather, all
      measurements occur within the same semester shortly after the
      OSCE.

      Final: Criterion T is not met because the documented follow-up
      after the intervention is shorter than one academic term.

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion D requires a well-documented control group, which
      includes (at minimum) clear group-specific characteristics and
      baseline performance/baseline outcome measures that allow readers
      to assess comparability of control vs intervention.

      The paper defines the control condition (OSCE in week 11) and
      provides overall sample demographics. However, it does not provide
      clearly stated baseline characteristics separately for control vs
      intervention.

      Additionally, the first measurement point is "directly after the
      OSCE" (T0), which is not a pre-intervention baseline for either
      group, because each group completes the OSCE at a different time.

      Final: Criterion D is not met because the control group is not
      documented with clearly reported group-specific baseline data.

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion S requires randomization at the school/site level
      (i.e., among multiple institutions or implementation sites).

      The paper reports a single setting (one lecture series at one
      university) and student-level random assignment to two groups.
      There is no evidence of multiple schools/sites being randomized.

      Final: Criterion S is not met because randomization was not at the
      school (site) level.

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion I requires independent conduct, meaning the study is
      conducted/evaluated by a team independent from the intervention
      designers, reducing bias.

      The paper indicates core roles (conceptualization, methodology,
      resources, data curation, supervision, project administration, and
      writing) were performed by the author team. While the authors
      acknowledge advice/support in statistical analysis, this is not
      described as an independent external evaluation team conducting
      the trial or its evaluation.

      Final: Criterion I is not met because independent conduct is not
      evidenced by the study descriptions and author contributions.

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least 75% of an
      academic year after the intervention begins.

      The described timeline for the intervention and measurement is
      within one semester, with the key difference between groups
      occurring between week 7 and week 11 and final measurement after a
      week 12 exam. This is substantially less than 75% of an academic
      year.

      Final: Criterion Y is not met because outcomes were measured
      within only part of a single semester.

  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Both groups received the same OSCE resources (same format/stations
      and duration), and the only difference (timing) is the intended
      treatment variable, so resource imbalance does not confound the
      intervention effect.
    quote: >-
      "The aim of the study was to compare different timings of a single
      formative OSCE, not to compare OSCE versus no OSCE. Therefore, no
      group without OSCE participation was included." (p. 2 of 8)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "All students participated in the OSCE." (p. 2 of 8)

      2) "The aim of the study was to compare different timings of a
      single formative OSCE, not to compare OSCE versus no OSCE.
      Therefore, no group without OSCE participation was included."
      (p. 2 of 8)

      3) "The formative OSCE consisted of five stations (morphology of
      teeth, oral hygiene, instruments, anatomy of the oral cavity,
      dental hard tissue defects and caries diagnosis). Each station
      lasted eight minutes, with a two-minute changeover period."
      (p. 2 of 8)

      4) "The intervention group (IG) completed a formative OSCE halfway
      through the semester (week 7), while the control group (CG)
      completed the OSCE in week 11, shortly before the final exam in
      preventive dentistry (week 12)." (p. 2 of 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion B checks whether the control group receives
      comparable educational time/resources, unless any difference in
      resources is explicitly the treatment variable being tested.

      Here, both groups received the same OSCE (same five stations and
      station duration). The experimental manipulation is the timing of
      the OSCE (week 7 vs week 11), which inherently changes how much
      time students have to use the formative experience before the week
      12 exam. That timing difference is the study's intended treatment
      variable ("different timings"), not an unintended resource
      imbalance.

      Under the criterion B decision logic: there is no extra budget/
      instructional input given only to the intervention group beyond
      the OSCE itself, and any timing-related "extra time to react" is
      integral to what is being tested.

      Final: Criterion B is met because both groups receive equivalent
      OSCE resources, with timing intentionally varied as the treatment
      variable.

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion R requires an independent replication by a
      different research team in a different context, published in a

      The paper does not describe itself as a replication study, and it
      does not cite an independent replication of this specific RCT
      design (randomized timing of a one-time formative OSCE with
      questionnaire-based outcomes).

      Internet searches performed for replications included: queries by
      DOI (10.1186/s12909-025-08533-5), exact title phrase, and author
      names (Pfeiffer-Grötz; Basten; Hollinderbäumer; Zöll; Deschner).
      No clearly independent peer-reviewed replication of this specific

      (p. 2 of 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion A requires all-subject standardized exam-based
      assessment, and the ERCT rules state that if criterion E is not
      met, criterion A is not met.

      This study's measured outcomes are questionnaire-based and the
      OSCE was ungraded with no recorded performance scores analyzed, so
      criterion E fails. Therefore, criterion A must also fail.

      Final: Criterion A is not met because criterion E is not met and
      the study does not use standardized all-subject exam outcomes.

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion G requires tracking participants through graduation
      at the relevant educational stage. Additionally, ERCT rules state:
      if criterion Y (Year Duration) is not met, then criterion G is not
      met.

      In this paper, the latest reported measurement time is "after the
      final exam" in the same semester. No outcomes are reported beyond
      that exam window, and there is no description of follow-up to any
      graduation milestone.

      Internet searches for follow-up publications by the same author
      team (queries by DOI and exact title, plus author-name searches)
      did not identify any subsequent peer-reviewed papers reporting
      graduation tracking for this cohort as of 2026-02-15.

      Final: Criterion G is not met because the study does not track to
      graduation, and criterion Y is not met.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study was previously presented to the Ethics Committee
      Rhineland-Palatinate, which waived the requirement for a formal
      procedure number as the project was classified as educational
      quality assurance." (p. 2 of 8)

      2) "For this reason, there is no procedure number for this study."
      (p. 8 of 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion P requires an explicit pre-registration reference
      (registry/platform and ID) and evidence that registration occurred
      before data collection began.

      The paper provides an ethics/quality-assurance description and
      explicitly notes there is no procedure number, but it does not
      provide any preregistration registry name (e.g., OSF, ISRCTN,
      ClinicalTrials.gov/DRKS), any registration identifier, or any
      preregistration date.

      Additional internet searches by DOI and exact title (including
      searches for OSF/preregistration pages) did not locate a clear
      preregistered protocol record for this study as of 2026-02-15.

      Final: Criterion P is not met because no preregistration ID/date
      evidence is reported or found.

  - `date_erct_check` set to **2026-02-15**.
- Verified and corrected quotes to match the paper text more strictly,
  including fixing page references and removing non-verbatim ellipses.
- Re-checked criteria **G**, **R**, and **P** using internet searches:
  - No follow-up paper reporting graduation tracking was found.
  - No independent replication study was found.
  - No preregistration record (and no in-paper preregistration ID/date)
    was found.
- Updated criterion **B** analysis to reflect the newer ERCT definition,
  explicitly treating timing as the intended treatment variable rather
  than an unintended resource imbalance.
- `erct_level` remains **0** because Level 1 criteria (C, E, T, D) are
  not all met.
