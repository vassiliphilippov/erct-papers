abstract: >-
  Individuals with developmental language disorder (DLD)
  often struggle with reading, both with reading comprehension
  and decoding. Although decoding difficulties are common in
  the population with DLD, studies investigating phonics-based
  interventions for these individuals are sparse. This study
  investigated the effect of a phonics-based computer game,
  GraphoLearn (GL). To our knowledge, this is the first
  randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of a
  phonics-based intervention method in children with DLD.
  Sixty-seven children enrolled in Grades 0–4 were randomized
  into three groups: one intervention group playing GL, one
  active control group playing a math game, and one control
  group that received teaching as usual. The duration of the
  intervention was 5 weeks. Decoding ability was measured at
  baseline, post-intervention, and at follow-up 10–12 weeks
  after the intervention. The effect of the intervention was
  analysed using mixed linear models. The analysis showed no
  significant differences between the groups in terms of
  improvement. Instead, all groups improved their decoding
  scores from baseline to follow-up. For children with DLD
  enrolled in Grades 0–4, it seems like playing the GL game
  does not improve decoding ability to a greater extent than
  teaching as usual. However, all groups did improve their
  decoding scores during study participation, indicating a
  potential to improve reading ability in a relatively short
  time despite having a diagnosis of DLD.

    explanation: >-
      Participants were randomized at the individual child
      level rather than by class (and the intervention is not
      described as one-to-one tutoring), so the class-level RCT
      requirement is not satisfied.
    quote: >-
      "When entering the study, the children with DLD were
      randomized, based on school-grade and sex, into three
      subgroups (strata), the GL-intervention group or one out
      of two control groups: one active control group playing a
      math computer game (Math group), and one passive control
      group undertaking teaching as usual (TAU group, see
      Figure 1)." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Sixty-seven children enrolled in Grades 0–4 were
      randomized into three groups: one intervention group
      playing GL, one active control group playing a math game,
      and one control group that received teaching as usual."
      (Abstract)

      2) "The participants with DLD were recruited from nine
      school language units in Sweden, where, in total, 209
      children with DLD were enrolled." (p. 4)

      3) "These schools have small classes for a maximum of 8–
      10 children with DLD." (p. 4)

      4) "When entering the study, the children with DLD were
      randomized, based on school-grade and sex, into three
      subgroups (strata), the GL-intervention group or one out
      of two control groups: one active control group playing a
      math computer game (Math group), and one passive control
      group undertaking teaching as usual (TAU group, see
      Figure 1)." (p. 5)

      5) "Participants were then randomized within each stratum
      to ensure equal representation (block size randomization)
      in all intervention groups." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion C requires randomization at the class
      level (or stronger, such as school-level) to reduce
      cross-condition contamination within classrooms and
      teacher practices. In this paper, the allocation is
      explicitly described as randomizing "the children" and
      then randomizing "within each stratum," which indicates
      an individual-level RCT rather than class-level
      assignment.

      The study context (nine language units with small classes)
      increases the plausibility that children and staff could
      interact across study arms within the same unit, which is
      precisely what Criterion C is meant to reduce.

      The exception for one-to-one tutoring/personal teaching
      does not clearly apply here because the intervention is a
      computer game played in school with a teacher "available
      in the room," not described as individualized tutoring as
      the intervention design itself.

      Criterion C is not met because randomization is at the
      individual child level, not at the class (or school)
      level, and no tutoring exception is clearly applicable.

  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study includes a widely recognized standardized test
      of decoding (TOWRE), satisfying the exam-based assessment
      requirement.
    quote: >-
      "Word decoding and nonsense word decoding were measured
      with the Swedish version of the Test of Word Reading
      Efficiency, TOWRE (Lyxell et al., 2009)." (p. 7)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Word decoding and nonsense word decoding were measured
      with the Swedish version of the Test of Word Reading
      Efficiency, TOWRE (Lyxell et al., 2009)." (p. 7)

      2) "TOWRE consists of two subtests that assess word
      decoding and nonsense word decoding." (p. 7)

      3) "Raw scores, but also standardized scores based on new
      Swedish reference data (see below for details), were
      reported." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion E requires using standardized, widely
      recognized exam-based (standardized) assessments rather
      than relying only on bespoke or intervention-aligned
      measures.

      While the paper also uses a GraphoLearn-based decoding
      task as its primary outcome, it clearly includes TOWRE,
      a widely used standardized decoding assessment, as a
      secondary outcome. This constitutes a standardized
      assessment instrument that is independent of the specific
      game content and is not newly created for this study.

      Therefore, the study satisfies Criterion E by including a
      recognized standardized assessment (TOWRE), even though
      not all outcomes are standardized exams.

      Criterion E is met because the study uses TOWRE, a widely
      recognized standardized reading test, as an outcome
      measure.

  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study measures outcomes through follow-up over about
      16 weeks from baseline, which is approximately one full
      academic term.
    quote: >-
      "The study adopted a longitudinal design ranging over
      16 weeks (see Figure 1)." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The duration of the intervention was 5 weeks."
      (Abstract)

      2) "Decoding ability was measured at baseline,
      post-intervention, and at follow-up 10–12 weeks after the
      intervention." (Abstract)

      3) "The study adopted a longitudinal design ranging over
      16 weeks (see Figure 1)." (p. 5)

      4) "After the first baseline assessment (T1), an
      intervention period of 5 weeks was initiated." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion T requires outcomes to be measured at least
      one full academic term after the intervention begins
      (typically about 3–4 months).

      The paper describes a 5-week intervention and a follow-up
      occurring 10–12 weeks after the intervention, and it
      summarizes the total longitudinal design as spanning 16
      weeks from baseline (T1) to follow-up (T3). Sixteen weeks
      is approximately 3.5–4 months, which aligns with a typical
      term-length tracking window.

      Criterion T is met because outcome measurement extends to
      an approximately 16-week follow-up window from baseline,
      meeting the minimum term-duration requirement.

  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The paper clearly defines both control conditions and
      reports baseline comparability across groups, satisfying
      the documented control group requirement.
    quote: >-
      "Sixty-seven children enrolled in Grades 0–4 were
      randomized into three groups: one intervention group

      randomized into three groups: one intervention group
      playing GL, one active control group playing a math game,
      and one control group that received teaching as usual."
      (Abstract)

      2) "When entering the study, the children with DLD were
      randomized... into three subgroups (strata), the
      GL-intervention group or one out of two control groups:
      one active control group playing a math computer game
      (Math group), and one passive control group undertaking
      teaching as usual (TAU group, see Figure 1)." (p. 5)

      3) "The TAU group undertook teaching as usual, that is,
      classroom-based teaching in small groups that followed
      the structure of the Swedish national curriculum." (p. 6)

      4) "There were no differences between the three groups at
      T1 on age, general language ability, non-verbal IQ,
      non-word repetition, or any of the reading measures."
      (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion D requires sufficiently detailed
      documentation of the control group(s), including what
      they received and evidence that baseline characteristics
      are reported to support comparability checks.

      The paper describes two control groups (active math-game
      control and passive teaching-as-usual control) and
      provides a concrete description of TAU. It also reports
      that there were no baseline differences among groups at
      T1 across key demographic, language, and reading measures,
      with descriptive statistics provided in the paper.

      Criterion D is met because control conditions are clearly
      defined and baseline group characteristics/comparability
      are documented.

  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Schools/language units were recruitment sites, but
      randomization was conducted at the child level rather
      than by school, so the school-level RCT criterion is not
      satisfied.
    quote: >-
      "When entering the study, the children with DLD were
      randomized, based on school-grade and sex, into three
      subgroups (strata)..." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The participants with DLD were recruited from nine
      school language units in Sweden..." (p. 4)

      2) "When entering the study, the children with DLD were
      randomized, based on school-grade and sex, into three
      subgroups (strata)..." (p. 5)

      3) "Participants were then randomized within each stratum
      to ensure equal representation (block size randomization)
      in all intervention groups." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion S requires that the unit of randomization
      is the school/site (i.e., schools are randomized to
      conditions), which better reflects real-world rollouts
      and avoids within-school spillovers.

      Although the sample is recruited from nine language units,
      the paper repeatedly describes randomizing the children
      (and then randomizing within strata). There is no
      statement that entire schools/language units were assigned
      to study conditions.

      Criterion S is not met because allocation is not at the
      school level.

  i:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      GraphoLearn is described as an externally developed
      program rather than one designed by the study authors,
      supporting independent conduct relative to the
      intervention’s designers.
    quote: >-

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The GL game is a computer-based reading intervention,
      originally from Finland (Lyytinen et al., 2007, 2009),
      translated from Finnish Swedish into standard Swedish
      (Nakeva von Mentzer, 2014)." (p. 4)

      2) "In each school, a special needs teacher or a
      speech-language pathologist was responsible for
      implementing the intervention." (p. 6)

      3) "The intervention fidelity was closely monitored by
      the research team using in-game data from the GL server
      to ensure that the participants were playing GL according
      to the study design, and feedback was given to the school
      when needed." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion I requires that the evaluation is conducted
      independently of the people who designed the intervention,
      to reduce bias from testing one's own product.

      The paper explicitly describes GraphoLearn as "originally
      from Finland" and cites external publications for its
      development and adaptation, suggesting the intervention
      itself is not authored/designed by this paper's author
      team. The delivery is carried out by school staff, not by
      the authors, even though the research team monitors
      fidelity.

      The paper does not present evidence that the authors are
      the GraphoLearn designers; rather, it frames the
      intervention as externally developed and implemented by
      practitioners in schools.

      Criterion I is met because the intervention is described
      as externally developed (not designed by the authors) and
      implemented by school personnel, supporting independent
      conduct relative to the intervention’s designers.

  y:

      16 weeks (see Figure 1)." (p. 5)

      2) "After the first baseline assessment (T1), an

      3) "Decoding ability was measured at baseline,
      post-intervention, and at follow-up 10–12 weeks after the
      intervention." (Abstract)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion Y requires outcomes to be measured at least
      75% of an academic year after the intervention begins.

      The paper explicitly states the design spans 16 weeks from
      baseline through follow-up. This is substantially less
      than 75% of a typical 9–10 month school year, and there is
      no claim of year-long outcome measurement for this cohort.

      Criterion Y is not met because the tracking period is only
      about 16 weeks rather than most of an academic year.

  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The active control matches the game dosage, but the TAU
      condition is not described as receiving comparable time
      and resources, and the paper does not clearly state that
      added resources/time are the treatment variable.
    quote: >-
      "The intervention group was instructed to play a minimum
      of 20 sessions of the GL game, for a minimum of 20 min and
      a maximum of 30 min per session..." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The intervention group was instructed to play a
      minimum of 20 sessions of the GL game, for a minimum of
      20 min and a maximum of 30 min per session, using
      headphones." (p. 5)

      2) "The Math group followed the same procedure as the GL
      group, namely 20 sessions during the same period." (p. 5)

      3) "The TAU group undertook teaching as usual, that is,
      classroom-based teaching in small groups that followed
      the structure of the Swedish national curriculum." (p. 6)

      4) "This study aimed to investigate the effect of a
      phonics-based computer game, GraphoLearn (GL)..." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion B requires that time and resources are
      balanced between intervention and control conditions,
      unless the study explicitly frames added time/resources
      as the treatment variable being tested.

      The paper clearly specifies a structured "dosage" for the
      GraphoLearn group (20 sessions, 20–30 minutes, headphones)
      and states that the active control (Math game) follows the
      same procedure, which supports balance for that
      comparison.

      However, the paper includes a TAU group described only as
      normal classroom-based teaching. It does not clearly state
      whether the game sessions replaced existing instructional
      time (resource-neutral) or were added on top of usual
      instruction (extra time/resource). It also does not
      explicitly frame "adding extra instructional time or extra
      resources" as the treatment variable; instead, it frames
      the intervention as the specific GraphoLearn program.

      Because the TAU condition is not documented as receiving
      comparable time-on-task, device access, supervision, or
      an equivalent substitute activity during the same minutes,
      the balance of educational inputs across all conditions
      cannot be confirmed.

      Criterion B is not met because equivalence of time and
      resources is not clearly documented for the TAU group, and
      added resources are not explicitly framed as the treatment
      variable.

  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication of this specific RCT could be

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion R requires evidence that an independent
      research team has replicated the study in a different
      context and published it in a peer-reviewed venue.

      The paper explicitly positions itself as the first RCT of
      this type in children with DLD, which suggests that a
      replication of this specific trial is not established
      within the paper.

      In addition, an external search (as of 2026-02-13) did not
      identify a peer-reviewed, independent replication that
      explicitly reproduces this exact trial design with
      GraphoLearn versus math-game and TAU controls in Swedish
      language units.

      Criterion R is not met because there is no evidence of an
      independent peer-reviewed replication of this specific RCT.

  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study assesses reading/decoding outcomes rather than
      standardized exam outcomes across all main school
      subjects, so the all-subject exams criterion is not met.
    quote: >-

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Three measures of reading were used." (p. 7)

      2) "The primary outcome was measured using the GL decoding
      task..." (p. 7)

      3) "Word decoding and nonsense word decoding were measured
      with the Swedish version of the Test of Word Reading
      Efficiency, TOWRE (Lyxell et al., 2009)." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion A requires standardized exam-based
      assessment across all main subjects taught at the relevant
      educational level (not only the intervention’s focal
      subject), to detect possible trade-offs.

      This study focuses on reading/decoding outcomes and
      describes only reading-related measures. It does not
      measure outcomes in other main subjects (for example,
      mathematics, science, or broader language-arts outcomes
      beyond decoding), and it is not presented as a specialized
      upper-secondary/vocational intervention where a narrow
      subject set would be justified.

      Criterion A is not met because outcome measurement is
      limited to reading/decoding and does not cover all main
      school subjects using standardized exams.

    explanation: >-
      The study ends after a short follow-up (weeks) and does

      graduation tracking (G).

      2) "The study adopted a longitudinal design ranging over
      16 weeks (see Figure 1)." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion G requires tracking participants until
      graduation from the relevant educational stage. ERCT also
      specifies that if Criterion Y (year duration) is not met,
      Criterion G cannot be met.

      The paper’s design spans 16 weeks and ends at a follow-up
      10–12 weeks after the intervention. There is no mention of
      tracking participants through completion of Grade 4 or any
      later graduation milestone, and the duration is far short
      of a school-year, let alone until graduation.

      An external search (as of 2026-02-13) did not identify a
      follow-up publication by the same author team that tracks
      this cohort to graduation.

      Criterion G is not met because the study does not track to
      graduation and the prerequisite year-duration criterion is
      not met.

      2021 to February 2023." (p. 5)

      record for NCT05295472)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion P requires that the study protocol is
      pre-registered before the study begins (i.e., registration
      date must precede the start of data collection).

      The paper reports that the trial was registered on
      ClinicalTrials.gov under NCT05295472, and it reports that
      data collection ran from September 2021 to February 2023.

      Checking the trial registry record for NCT05295472 shows a
      study start date of August 1, 2021 and a first posted date
      of March 25, 2022. This indicates that registration was
      posted after the study started and after data collection
      had already begun (given the paper’s September 2021 start
      of data collection).

      Criterion P is not met because the registry posting date
      occurs after the study start and after data collection
      began, so the protocol was not pre-registered.

## Change summary

1) Added missing metadata fields:
   - `paper_link` set to the DOI landing page.
   - `pdf_link` set to a direct SAGE PDF URL.
   - `date_erct_check` set to **2026-02-13**.
   - Also filled `publication_date` (set to **2026-01-06**).

2) Re-checked and updated criterion **E**:
   - Changed **E** from *not met* to *met* because the study uses the
     standardized **TOWRE** assessment.

3) Re-checked and updated criterion **P** using registry information:
   - Kept **P** as *not met*, but replaced the reasoning with explicit
     registry timing (first posted after study start / after data
     collection began).

4) Re-checked criteria **G** and **R** using internet searches:
   - Kept both as *not met* and explicitly noted that no follow-up paper
     tracking to graduation (G) and no independent replication (R) were
     identifiable as of **2026-02-13**.

5) Reformatted/rewrote analysis blocks to match the required structure:
   - "Relevant Quotes" + "Detailed Analysis" + a final one-sentence
     conclusion, with spacing and line wrapping to stay within 80 chars.
