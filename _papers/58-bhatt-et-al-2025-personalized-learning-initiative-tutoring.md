abstract: >-
  This report summarizes the ongoing work by the Personalized Learning
  Initiative (PLI) research team to understand whether and how scaling high
  dosage tutoring (HDT) works in the post-pandemic environment. The study
  involved a large-scale randomized controlled trial with eight partners
  across the US in the 2023-24 school year. Findings indicate that tutoring
  is effective overall, with impacts ranging from 0.06-0.09 SD. Lower-cost
  models were found to be just as effective as higher-cost models, and
  virtual tutoring appeared comparable to in-person tutoring.

  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Randomization includes student-level lotteries, but because the
      intervention is tutoring, the ERCT tutoring exception applies.
    quote: >-
      "We randomly assigned eligible students to one of three
      conditions—HDT, SHDT,
      or a business as usual group—using individual-level,
      classroom-level, and teacher-level lotteries." (p. 28)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We randomly assigned eligible students to one of three
      conditions—HDT, SHDT,
      or a business as usual group—using individual-level,
      classroom-level, and
      teacher-level lotteries." (p. 28)

      2) "HDT - 4:1 tutoring – At 23 of our study schools, tutors worked with
      groups
      of four students." (p. 22)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomization at the class level or higher to
      reduce
      contamination. The ERCT exception applies when the intervention is
      personal
      teaching such as tutoring, where student-level randomization can still
      be
      acceptable.

      This study evaluates high dosage tutoring delivered in small groups
      (for
      example 4:1). Randomization is often at the student level (and
      sometimes at
      classroom or grade level), but because the intervention is tutoring
      (personal
      instruction), the tutoring exception applies.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is met because the intervention is tutoring
      and the
      ERCT tutoring exception allows student-level randomization.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes are measured using established standardized assessments such as
      state tests, NWEA MAP, i-Ready, STAR, and PSAT/SAT.
    quote: >-
      "The following assessments are included in the index outcome for
      Chicago: STAR, i-Ready, Illinois Assessment of Readiness (IAR), PSAT,
      and SAT." (p. 26)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The following assessments are included in the index outcome for
      Chicago:
      STAR, i-Ready, Illinois Assessment of Readiness (IAR), PSAT, and SAT."
      (p. 26)

      2) "The following assessments are included in the index outcome for
      Fulton:
      NWEA MAP, Georgia Milestones, i-Ready." (p. 32)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires outcomes measured using standardized, widely
      recognized
      exams rather than researcher-created tests. Across sites, the report
      lists
      standardized state assessments (for example Georgia Milestones) and
      widely used
      standardized tests (for example NWEA MAP, i-Ready, STAR, PSAT/SAT) used
      to
      construct the primary end-of-year outcome indices.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is met because outcomes rely on established
      standardized assessments rather than custom tests.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Interventions and end-of-year outcome measurement occur over at least an
      academic-term scale from intervention start to testing.
    quote: >-
      "We piloted HDT in nine middle schools and SHDT in one school, starting
      in the second semester (January-May 2024)." (p. 46)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We piloted HDT in nine middle schools and SHDT in one school,
      starting in the
      second semester (January-May 2024)." (p. 46)

      2) "Tutoring was scheduled for at least 90 minutes per week over 32-36
      weeks."
      (p. 50)

      3) "Tutoring began in February 2024 and lasted for 12 weeks." (p. 60)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that outcomes are measured at least one academic
      term
      (approximately 3-4 months) after the intervention begins. The report's
      outcome
      measures are end-of-year standardized tests. Several sites ran spring
      pilots
      (January-May 2024) which spans roughly a term, and other sites ran
      longer (up to
      32-36 weeks).

      Although some interventions were relatively short (for example 12 weeks
      after a
      February start), the combination of spring start plus end-of-year
      testing implies
      a term-scale follow-up window from intervention start to outcome
      measurement.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is met because outcome measurement occurs at
      end of
      year after interventions that, in the shortest cases, span
      approximately a term
      from start to end-of-year testing.

      The BAU control condition is defined and detailed baseline balance tables
      document control group characteristics.
    quote: >-
      "HDT stands for high dosage tutoring, SHDT stands for sustainable high
      dosage tutoring, and BAU stands for business as usual (our
      control group)." (p. 13)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "HDT stands for high dosage tutoring, SHDT stands for sustainable
      high dosage
      tutoring, and BAU stands for business as usual (our control group)."
      (p. 13)

      2) "Table 2: Baseline balance, pooled analysis sample 2023-24, HDT"
      (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control group is clearly defined and
      described,
      including baseline characteristics. The report defines BAU as the
      control group
      and provides extensive baseline balance tables for pooled and
      site-specific
      samples, reporting control means, sample sizes, and baseline covariates
      (for
      example demographics and prior scores).

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the BAU control group is
      defined and
      baseline characteristics are documented in detailed balance tables.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization is at student, classroom, teacher, or grade level, not at
      the school level.
    quote: >-
      "Randomization Level... Student... Classroom... Grade" (Table 1, p. 13)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Randomization Level... Student... Classroom... Grade" (Table 1,
      p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the school level. Table 1 reports
      that
      randomization occurred at the student, classroom, teacher, or grade
      level across
      sites. No site is described as using school-level randomization.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met because the study does not
      randomize at
      the school level.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Researchers co-designed the tutoring models with partner districts, so
      evaluation was not fully independent of intervention design.
    quote: >-
      "In each of our PLI sites, we partnered with policymakers and district
      and school practitioners to co-design how to
      operationalize the tenets of HDT and SHDT to fit their local
      context." (p. 12)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In each of our PLI sites, we partnered with policymakers and
      district and
      school practitioners to co-design how to operationalize the tenets of
      HDT and
      SHDT to fit their local context." (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that evaluators are independent of the
      intervention's
      design and delivery. The report states that the research team partnered
      with
      district and school practitioners to co-design how tutoring models
      would be
      operationalized. This indicates direct involvement in intervention
      design rather
      than evaluation of an externally designed, independently delivered
      program.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because the research team
      co-designed the
      interventions with practitioners.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Several sites implemented tutoring only in spring 2024 (or for about 12
      weeks), which is shorter than a full academic year.
    quote: >-
      "We piloted HDT in nine middle schools and SHDT in one school, starting
      in the second semester (January-May 2024)." (p. 46)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We piloted HDT in nine middle schools and SHDT in one school,
      starting in the
      second semester (January-May 2024)." (p. 46)

      2) "Tutoring began in February 2024 and lasted for 12 weeks." (p. 60)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires that outcomes are measured at least one full
      academic year
      after the intervention begins. Several sites explicitly implemented
      tutoring only
      in the second semester or for around 12 weeks beginning in February
      2024. These
      durations are substantially shorter than an academic year from
      intervention start
      to outcome measurement.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because key sites implemented
      tutoring for
      less than a full academic year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study explicitly tests the effect of providing additional tutoring
      resources relative to business-as-usual.
    quote: >-
      "Randomization status was also preserved as we see low control crossover
      overall—less than 3% of students assigned to the
      control group received tutoring services, though they did receive all
      other services a school had to offer." (p. 16)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "HDT stands for high dosage tutoring, SHDT stands for sustainable
      high dosage
      tutoring, and BAU stands for business as usual (our control group)."
      (p. 13)

      2) "Randomization status was also preserved as we see low control
      crossover
      overall—less than 3% of students assigned to the control group received
      tutoring
      services, though they did receive all other services a school had to
      offer."
      (p. 16)

      3) "We randomly assigned eligible students to one of three
      conditions—HDT, SHDT,
      or a business as usual group—using individual-level, classroom-level,
      and
      teacher-level lotteries." (p. 28)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B requires balanced time and resources across treatment and
      control,
      unless the study explicitly tests additional resources as the treatment
      variable.
      Here, the intervention is tutoring itself, which necessarily adds
      instructional
      time and staffing relative to BAU. The report frames BAU as the control
      and
      contrasts it with being assigned to tutoring conditions. This is a
      classic case
      where additional instructional resources (tutoring time, tutors) are
      the
      treatment variable by design.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is met because the study explicitly tests
      the impact
      of providing additional tutoring resources relative to BAU.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent peer-reviewed replication of this specific PLI 2023-24
      study design was identified.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This interim report presents the impact of tutoring on this sample
      of
      students in the 2023-2024 school year, with the subsequent sections
      focusing on
      site-by-site impacts." (p. 21)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication by other authors in
      another
      context, published as a peer-reviewed study. The report itself is an
      interim
      multi-site impact report and does not present itself as a replication of
      a prior
      study, nor does it cite an independent replication of this specific PLI
      design.

      A web search for independent replications of this specific PLI 2023-24
      design did
      not identify peer-reviewed replication studies by independent teams.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because there is no evidence of
      an
      independent peer-reviewed replication of this specific study.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Primary outcomes are standardized tests in the tutored subject, not
      across all core subjects.
    quote: >-
      "The outcome of interest is an index of all available relevant EOY
      standardized test scores in the tutored subject." (p. 7)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The outcome of interest is an index of all available relevant EOY
      standardized test scores in the tutored subject." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires measuring standardized exam outcomes across all core
      subjects, not only the tutored subject. The report consistently defines
      the
      primary outcome as end-of-year standardized tests in the tutored subject
      (math
      or reading, depending on site). It does not report standardized outcomes
      for
      non-tutored core subjects.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because outcomes are limited to
      the
      tutored subject rather than all core subjects.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      This interim report reports end-of-year outcomes and does not track
      students to graduation; additionally, Y is not met.
    quote: >-
      "This interim report presents the impact
      of tutoring on this sample of students in the 2023-2024
      school year, with the subsequent sections focusing on site-by-
      site impacts." (p. 21)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This interim report presents the impact of tutoring on this sample
      of
      students in the 2023-2024 school year, with the subsequent sections
      focusing on
      site-by-site impacts." (p. 21)

      2) "After sample enrollment and program implementation is complete in
      2026,
      future reports will present findings about the average impact across all
      years
      and sites..." (p. 21)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation. This
      document is an
      interim report focused on end-of-year outcomes for the 2023-24 school
      year and
      describes planned future reporting after enrollment and implementation
      ends.
      There is no graduation follow-up reported here, and because Criterion Y
      (year
      duration) is not met, Criterion G cannot be met under the ERCT
      dependency rule.

      A web search for follow-up publications by the same authors reporting
      graduation
      tracking for the PLI cohorts did not identify any papers with graduation
      outcomes.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because the study does not track
      students
      to graduation (and Y is not met).
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      An OSF link is provided, but the pre-registration timestamp could not be
      verified to precede the study start.
    quote: >-
      "The pre-analysis plan for this study is posted on Open Science
      Framework at the link below.

      Framework at
      the link below.
      https://osf.io/fkjmn/" (p. 66)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the study protocol (or analysis plan) is
      publicly
      registered before the study begins, and that this timing can be verified
      from
      the registry record (for example a registration date prior to data
      collection or
      randomization). The report provides an OSF link to a pre-analysis plan.

      However, the OSF project page and file metadata (creation / upload
      dates) could
      not be accessed reliably through the available web tools during this
      review, so
      the registration timestamp relative to study start could not be
      independently
      verified.

      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met because the existence of an OSF
      link is
      not sufficient without a verifiable pre-registration date that precedes
      the
      study start.
