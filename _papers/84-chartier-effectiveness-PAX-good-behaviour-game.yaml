abstract: >-
  Purpose PAX Good Behaviour Game (PAX-GBG), a school-based
  mental health promotion approach, has been shown to improve
  children’s mental health and academic outcomes. Given that
  these effects have yet to be shown in Indigenous
  populations, a partnership with First Nations communities
  was created to evaluate PAX-GBG’s effectiveness among First
  Nations children living in Canada. Methods In this
  clustered randomized controlled trial, we used
  population-based administrative data that allowed
  de-identified individual-level linkages. Our cohort from 20
  First Nations schools was assigned to PAX-GBG (n = 468) or
  wait-list control (n = 255). We used multi-level
  regression modeling and propensity score weighting to
  estimate group differences in mental health and academic
  outcomes over time (2011–2020). Results PAX-GBG group
  children had significantly greater decreases in conduct
  problems, hyperactivity-inattention, and peer problems and
  a greater increase in prosocial scores than control group
  children. The percentage of PAX-GBG group children meeting
  academic expectations was higher than control group
  children. However, only third-grade numeracy and
  eighth-grade reading and writing were statistically
  significant. We found no evidence that PAX-GBG was
  associated with less emotional problems, diagnosed mental
  disorders, or greater student engagement or mathematics.
  Conclusion These findings suggest that PAX-GBG is a
  promising intervention in improving First Nations
  children’s mental health and academic outcomes. What
  remains unclear is whether these findings are
  generalizable to all First Nations and how adding supports
  for program implementation would influence these findings.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Randomization occurred at the school level, which meets
      (and exceeds) the class-level RCT requirement.
    quote: >-
      "Randomization occurred at the school level."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Randomization occurred at the school level." (page
      not provided)

      2) "A clustered RCT was conducted in Manitoba, a province
      in central Canada with a population of 1.4 million in
      academic year 2011/12 with follow-up data until
      2019/2020." (page not provided)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires that the study be randomized at the
      class level or stronger (e.g., school level), to reduce
      contamination across treatment and control groups within
      the same classroom.

      The paper explicitly states that randomization occurred
      at the school level. School-level randomization is
      stronger than class-level randomization for the purposes
      of avoiding within-school contamination and therefore
      satisfies Criterion C.

      Final summary: Criterion C is met because randomization
      occurred at the school level (stronger than class level).

  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Academic outcomes were based on teacher assessments of
      meeting expectations, not standardized exam scores.
    quote: >-
      "These assessments were conducted by teachers to
      evaluate student’s strengths and needs in third grade
      reading and numeracy, seventh grade student engagement
      and mathematics, and eighth grade reading and writing."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Academic outcomes were derived from the Department of
      Education database that included assessments of
      children’s learning needs early in the school year."
      (page not provided)

      2) "These assessments were conducted by teachers to
      evaluate student’s strengths and needs in third grade
      reading and numeracy, seventh grade student engagement
      and mathematics, and eighth grade reading and writing."
      (page not provided)

      3) "Teachers report whether their students: “met academic
      expectations”, “approached expectations” or “have not met
      them”." (page not provided)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized, exam-based assessments
      (i.e., widely recognized standardized tests), rather than
      teacher ratings or teacher-made assessments.

      The paper describes the academic outcomes as teacher-
      conducted assessments and explicitly frames the outcome
      categories as teacher reports (met / approached / have
      not met). The paper does not describe these as provincial
      or national standardized exams.

      Final summary: Criterion E is not met because the
      academic outcomes are teacher assessments rather than
      standardized exams.

  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured at least through the end of the
      school year (and beyond), meeting the term-duration
      requirement.
    quote: >-
      "Teachers were asked to administer the Strengths and
      Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) before implementing
      PAX-GBG and again at the end of the school year."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Children assigned to schools in the PAX-GBG group
      received between three to eight months of intervention
      during their first-grade school year." (page not
      provided)

      2) "Teachers were asked to administer the Strengths and
      Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) before implementing
      PAX-GBG and again at the end of the school year." (page
      not provided)

      3) "A clustered RCT was conducted in Manitoba, a province
      in central Canada with a population of 1.4 million in
      academic year 2011/12 with follow-up data until
      2019/2020." (page not provided)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that outcomes be measured at least
      one academic term (about 3 to 4 months) after the
      intervention begins.

      The paper reports that the intervention exposure lasted
      "between three to eight months" during the Grade 1 school
      year, and it states that teachers completed SDQ measures
      before implementation and "again at the end of the school
      year." This indicates that the main short-term outcome
      measurement was at least term-length after the start of
      implementation (and in practice appears to be end-of-year
      follow-up).

      Final summary: Criterion T is met because outcomes were
      collected at the end of the school year after several
      months of intervention exposure.

  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The wait-list control group is clearly described with
      sample sizes, exposure status, and baseline covariates.
    quote: >-
      "Our final sample included 723 students from 20 schools:
      468 students from 11 schools that had implemented PAX-GBG
      and 255 students from 9 schools who were in the wait-list
      control group."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Our cohort from 20 First Nations schools was assigned
      to PAX-GBG (n = 468) or wait-list control (n = 255)."
      (page not provided)

      2) "Our final sample included 723 students from 20
      schools: 468 students from 11 schools that had
      implemented PAX-GBG and 255 students from 9 schools who
      were in the wait-list control group." (page not provided)

      3) "Children from wait-list control schools were not
      exposed to the intervention." (page not provided)

      4) "Table 1 Child and family covariates before PAX-GBG
      implementation by PAX-GBG and wait-list control groups..."
      (Table 1; page not provided)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control group be well
      documented, including who is in it, the control condition
      itself, and baseline characteristics.

      The paper clearly identifies a wait-list control group,
      provides sample sizes and numbers of schools in each
      group, and explicitly states that wait-list control
      schools were "not exposed to the intervention." Baseline
      covariates are also reported (Table 1), supporting that
      the groups are documented and describable.

      Final summary: Criterion D is met because the wait-list
      control group is clearly defined and documented with
      sample sizes, exposure status, and baseline covariates.

  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The unit of randomization was the school, satisfying the
      school-level RCT requirement.
    quote: >-
      "Randomization occurred at the school level."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Randomization occurred at the school level." (page

      2) "Our cohort from 20 First Nations schools was assigned
      to PAX-GBG (n = 468) or wait-list control (n = 255)."
      (page not provided)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires random assignment at the school
      level.

      The paper explicitly states that randomization occurred
      at the school level and describes a multi-school sample,
      which directly meets Criterion S.

      Final summary: Criterion S is met because schools were
      randomized.

  i:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The RCT is described as designed and led by the
      government of Manitoba rather than the intervention
      developer.
    quote: >-
      "The RCT was designed and led by the government of
      Manitoba to evaluate PAX-GBG’s effectiveness when
      implemented with first graders in the province [29]."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The RCT was designed and led by the government of
      Manitoba to evaluate PAX-GBG’s effectiveness when
      implemented with first graders in the province [29]."
      (page not provided)

      2) "Finally, the authors are appreciative of the PAXIS
      Institute for the ingenuity, generosity, and interest in
      adapting and developing PAX-GBG for the benefit of
      Indigenous people." (page not provided)

      3) "Competing interests The authors declare no competing
      interests." (page not provided)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the evaluation be conducted
      independently of the intervention developer/designer, or
      that the paper credibly documents independence in the
      conduct of the trial.

      The paper states the RCT "was designed and led by the
      government of Manitoba," which indicates leadership of
      the RCT by government rather than by the PAX-GBG developer
      (PAXIS Institute). The acknowledgement of PAXIS Institute
      is consistent with a developer being recognized but not
      leading the evaluation. The paper also declares no
      competing interests.

      Final summary: Criterion I is met because the trial is
      described as government-led rather than developer-led.

  y:
    met: true

      Participants were followed from Grade 1 through Grade 9,
      far exceeding 75% of an academic year.

      "Children in both groups were then followed from first
      grade to ninth grade (September 2011 – March 2020)..."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Children in both groups were then followed from first
      grade to ninth grade (September 2011 – March 2020) to
      determine shorter-term mental and behavioural (SDQ)
      outcomes and longer-term diagnosed mental disorders and
      academic outcomes." (page not provided)

      2) "Methods In this clustered randomized controlled
      trial... estimate group differences... over time
      (2011–2020)." (page not provided)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires that outcomes be measured at least
      75% of an academic year after the intervention begins.

      The paper documents follow-up from Grade 1 through Grade
      9 (2011 to 2020). This is substantially longer than a
      single academic year and therefore clearly meets the year
      duration threshold.

      Final summary: Criterion Y is met because outcomes were
      tracked over multiple years (2011–2020).

  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The added training/materials are integral to delivering
      PAX-GBG, and classroom delivery occurs during regular
      school activities rather than adding extra instructional
      time.
    quote: >-
      "Teachers in schools randomized to PAX-GBG attended a
      2-day training on PAX-GBG implementation... and were
      provided the materials to use PAX-GBG in their
      classrooms."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Teachers receive a 2-day training on how to implement
      these strategies in their classrooms." (page not
      provided)

      2) "Teachers in schools randomized to PAX-GBG attended a
      2-day training on PAX-GBG implementation between November
      2011 and March 2012 and were provided the materials to
      use PAX-GBG in their classrooms." (page not provided)

      3) "Children from wait-list control schools were not
      exposed to the intervention." (page not provided)

      4) "The main strategy, GBG, is played several times a day
      during regular school activities..." (page not provided)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B compares time and resources provided to
      intervention and control groups. If the intervention adds
      extra resources, the control should receive comparable
      educational inputs, unless the extra resources are
      integral to what is being tested (i.e., the intervention
      package).

      The intervention clearly includes additional resources:
      teacher training ("2-day training") and provision of
      materials. The control group is a wait-list group that is
      "not exposed to the intervention," and the paper does not
      describe equivalent training/materials for the control.

      However, these resources are not described as optional
      add-ons; they are inherent requirements for implementing
      PAX-GBG as defined in the paper. In addition, the core
      classroom component is stated to occur "during regular
      school activities," which indicates the intervention is
      not simply adding extra student instructional time on top
      of usual schooling.

      Under the updated Criterion B guidance, the imbalance in
      training/materials does not automatically fail the
      criterion when those inputs are integral to the treatment
      package being evaluated against business-as-usual.

      Final summary: Criterion B is met because the additional
      resources (training/materials) are integral to the
      PAX-GBG package, and delivery occurs during regular
      school activities.

  r:

    explanation: >-
      No independent peer-reviewed replication of this specific
      Manitoba First Nations administrative-data clustered RCT
      was found.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Given that these effects have yet to be shown in
      Indigenous populations, a partnership with First Nations

      2) "This current study is part of a larger research
      program that investigated the acceptability, usefulness
      and effectiveness of PAX-GBG among First Nations
      children..." (page not provided)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires independent replication of this
      study by a different research team in a different context
      in a peer-reviewed journal.

      The paper frames this evaluation as filling a gap for
      Indigenous populations ("have yet to be shown in
      Indigenous populations"), which suggests this specific
      population-context study is novel rather than previously
      replicated.

      Internet searching for reproductions/replications of this
      specific study (same Manitoba First Nations cohort /
      administrative-data clustered RCT context) did not
      identify any independent peer-reviewed replication paper.
      While there are many PAX-GBG / GBG trials in other
      settings, those are not replications of this specific
      study.

      Final summary: Criterion R is not met because no
      independent replication of this specific study was found.

  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Criterion E is not met, so All-subject Exams cannot be
      met; additionally, outcomes are not standardized exams
      across all core subjects.
    quote: >-

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "These assessments were conducted by teachers to

      2) "Teachers report whether their students: “met academic
      expectations”, “approached expectations” or “have not met
      them”." (page not provided)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized, exam-based assessment
      across all main subjects and is explicitly not met if
      Criterion E is not met.

      Here, Criterion E is not met because academic outcomes
      are teacher assessments rather than standardized exams.
      Therefore, Criterion A cannot be met. Independently, the
      outcomes listed are not a full set of standardized exams
      across all core subjects.

      Final summary: Criterion A is not met because Criterion E
      is not met and the study does not use standardized exams
      across all core subjects.

  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper reports follow-up through Grade 9 rather than

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until
      graduation. (Per ERCT rules, Criterion G cannot be met if
      Criterion Y is not met; here Y is met, so graduation
      tracking is evaluated normally.)

      The paper documents follow-up through ninth grade and to
      March 2020, including an "eight-year period" for some
      outcomes. This is long-term follow-up, but it is not
      described as tracking participants through high-school
      graduation (or another explicitly defined graduation
      endpoint).

      Additional internet searching for subsequent peer-
      reviewed follow-up publications by the same author team
      tracking this specific Manitoba First Nations RCT cohort
      to graduation did not identify a paper that reports
      graduation outcomes for this cohort.

      Final summary: Criterion G is not met because follow-up
      ends at Grade 9 / March 2020 and graduation tracking was
      not found.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the study protocol be
      pre-registered before data collection begins, with a
      verifiable registry entry (and date) demonstrating
      prospective registration.

      The paper provides ethics and data governance approvals,
      but it does not report any trial registration number or
      pre-registration link/date. Internet searching identified
      that other Good Behaviour Game trials in other countries
      have been registered (e.g., UK GBG trials in ISRCTN), but
      no registry record specific to this Manitoba clustered
      RCT (academic year 2011/12) was found.

      Final summary: Criterion P is not met because no
      prospective pre-registration evidence (registry ID and
      date) is reported or found for this trial.
