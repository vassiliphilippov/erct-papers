  This paper provides causal evidence on parental involvement in a financial
  education course. Two randomised controlled trials were conducted with 2779
  students (grade 8 and 9) in Flanders, assigning schools to three treatment
  variants and one control group. Although the combined classroom intervention
  and homework showed positive effects on financial literacy, adding a prompt
  for parental involvement did not significantly increase learning gains on
  average. However, disadvantaged students benefited more from the parental
  involvement prompt in behavioral items. The study is registered in the AEA
  RCT Registry (AEARCTR-0003481).

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They randomized at the school level, which is stronger than class-level
      randomization.
    quote: >-
      “Randomisation was done at school level … 116 schools registered … assigned
      in four experimental groups…” (pp. 6–7)
    analysis: >-
      Criterion C requires a Randomised Controlled Trial at the class level or
      stronger. The paper explicitly states that randomization occurred at the
      school level: “Randomisation was done at school level in order to avoid
      contamination at class or teacher level.” (p. 7). Since randomizing entire
      schools is stronger than randomizing classes, the study meets this
      requirement. The authors describe how 116 schools registered and were
      assigned to different treatment arms or a control group. This approach
      surpasses the typical class-level RCT requirement because entire schools
      were allocated to either a control or a treatment condition. They also
      emphasize that this method helped avoid cross-contamination among classes
      in the same school. Thus, the randomization design here meets or exceeds
      class-level RCT, and so Criterion C is satisfied.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They used a custom-developed instrument rather than a standardized,
      widely recognized exam.
    quote: >-
      “The pretest ... was composed of items specifically covering the topics of
      the intervention ... The remainder of the test items measured attitudes.”
      (p. 10)
    analysis: >-
      Criterion E requires the use of an externally developed, standardized exam-
      based assessment. The paper describes a custom instrument: “The pretest
      consisted of 38 items ... Financial literacy was assessed on nine multiple
      choice questions about the course material…” (p. 10). They also note:
      “The post-test comprised an equivalent, slightly modified question set with
      36 items.” (p. 11). These tests were specifically designed for measuring
      knowledge and behavior changes aligned with the financial education
      content. No reference is made to using an established standardized exam
      (like a national or state-wide test). Instead, the authors note that these
      questions were tailored to the intervention. While they validated the items
      through pilot work, such in-house measures do not constitute a widely
      recognized standardized exam. Hence, the paper does not describe using any
      external, standardized exam tool. Criterion E is therefore not met.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention lasted only a few weeks and did not extend over a full
      academic term.
    quote: >-
      “Classes in grade 8 participated between February and mid-April 2018, ... 
      second wave ... mid-April and June 2018 ... The course consisted of four
      class periods.” (pp. 8–9)
    analysis: >-
      Criterion T requires an intervention lasting at least a full academic term
      (about 3–4 months). According to the paper, “In the first wave, classes in
      grade 8 participated between February and mid-April 2018, followed by a
      second wave with classes in grade 9 between mid-April and June 2018.”
      (p. 9). Furthermore, “The intervention ... was implemented in two waves to
      increase external validity...” (p. 9). However, the actual course consisted
      of only four class periods (see p. 8) plus a short homework. This timeline
      indicates that the main program—four hours of classroom game-based learning
      plus one homework assignment—took place over weeks rather than an entire
      term. Therefore, this does not meet the T requirement of running for an
      entire academic term (3+ months). Thus, T is not met.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They provide thorough baseline data (demographics, test scores) for the
      control group.
    quote: >-
      “Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics and test scores ... with 850
      students in the control group.” (pp. 12–13)
    analysis: >-
      Criterion D requires that the control group be well-documented with baseline
      performance and demographic details. The authors identify a control group
      clearly: “At the end of the last class, students in the treatment groups
      completed a post-test. The control group received the post-test six weeks after
      the pretest.” (p. 9). Table 1 includes control group data for 850 students
      from 18 schools, as well as their demographic variables (gender, grades,
      socio-economic status, etc.). They also show the control group’s baseline
      financial literacy scores: “...the control group scored on average 2.99 (out
      of 9) on the pretest.” (p. 12). These tables confirm that the authors
      document the group’s composition, performance, and characteristics. Hence,
      the control group is clearly described and measured, meeting Criterion D.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They randomized entire schools, fulfilling the requirement for school-level
      RCT.
    quote: >-
      “Randomisation was done at school level in order to avoid contamination ...
      Registered schools were randomised...” (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Criterion S requires randomization at the school level. The paper states:
      “Randomisation was done at school level in order to avoid contamination at
      class or teacher level. Registered schools were randomised in four
      experimental groups.” (p. 7). Because entire schools, rather than individual
      classes or students, were assigned to control or various treatment arms, the
      study design clearly meets the stronger standard of school-level
      randomization. This also implies it meets the weaker class-level RCT
      requirement. Hence, S is met unequivocally.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They measured financial literacy outcomes only and did not test other core
      subjects.
    quote: >-
      “Financial literacy was assessed on nine multiple choice questions …
      measuring knowledge and behavior.” (p. 10)
    analysis: >-
      Criterion A requires measurement of all main subjects (e.g., math, language,
      science) via standardized exam-based assessments. The study focuses
      exclusively on a financial literacy dimension: “Financial literacy was
      assessed on nine multiple choice questions ... The rest ... measured
      attitudes and background characteristics.” (p. 10). No mention is made of
      measuring core subjects such as mathematics or language arts using
      standardized tests, nor do they indicate monitoring unintended consequences
      on other areas of study. Thus, the authors do not assess outcomes in all main
      school subjects. Criterion A is not met.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The program occurred only over a few weeks and does not span an entire
      academic year.
    quote: >-
      “...four class periods ... implemented in two short waves between
      February and June 2018.” (pp. 8–9)
    analysis: >-
      Criterion Y requires the intervention to last a full academic year. According
      to the paper: “Teachers assigned this homework ... The classroom
      intervention consisted of a computer game about payment methods with a
      duration of four class periods.” (p. 8). Students participated for a few weeks
      in wave 1 (February–April 2018) or wave 2 (April–June 2018). This is a
      short-term program rather than a year-long or full-year approach.
      Consequently, the requirement of a year duration for the intervention is not
      satisfied.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Only the treatment group received the extra lesson/game/hours. The control
      group got no equivalent resource/time.
    quote: >-
      “The control group received the post-test six weeks after the pretest ...
      After the experiment, the teaching material was sent to the control group as a
      reward…” (p. 9)
    analysis: >-
      Criterion B requires that if the intervention group receives extra time or
      resources, the control group should receive an equivalent amount for ‘business
      as usual.’ In this paper, the control group simply did not receive the
      intervention, and no additional compensatory resources were offered. The
      authors describe how “After the experiment, the teaching material was sent to
      the control group as a reward...” (p. 9), but that was only after data
      collection. During the active period of the study, the treatment groups had a
      four-hour specialized program plus homework; the control group did not.
      There is no mention of matching resources or time allocations for the
      control group. Hence, the design does not balance the resources or contact
      time. Therefore, B is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They measured short-term post-test outcomes only, with no follow-up through
      final graduation.
    quote: >-
      “Students ... completed a post-test at the end of the class ... a second
      post-test, on average seven weeks later...” (p. 9)
    analysis: >-
      Criterion G requires tracking participants through graduation from their
      current school level. This paper measures outcomes immediately at the end of
      the intervention and again several weeks later via a second post-test:
      “Two weeks after the end of the intervention period, schools in the treatment
      groups were sent a second post-test...” (p. 9). But there is no mention of
      following students until they complete grade 8 or 9. The authors only measure
      short-run outcomes, not tracking to the end of secondary schooling. Hence,
      G is not met.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They did two waves under the same study team, no independent replication by
      an external group.
    quote: >-
      “The intervention was implemented in two waves ... to increase external
      validity …” (pp. 8–9)
    analysis: >-
      Criterion R requires an independent replication by a different research
      team. The authors do conduct two waves, but it is all within the same
      overarching project and group of researchers. There is no mention of a
      replication by a separate independent team. Indeed, wave 1 and wave 2 are
      simply consecutive cohorts in the same trial design. Consequently, there is
      no independent replication of the intervention in another context by
      outside researchers. Hence, R is not met.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The same team developed the materials and carried out the study; there is no
      evidence of external independence.
    quote: >-
      “The assignment consisted of a handout and quiz created by senior teachers in
      the project team.” (p. 8)
    analysis: >-
      Criterion I requires that the study be carried out independently from the
      intervention’s principal designers. Here, the authors themselves designed
      or oversaw the intervention. They state, “The assignment was created by
      senior teachers in the project team.” (p. 8). The paper does not indicate
      that an external or separate research agency implemented the trial.
      Instead, the authors managed the entire random assignment and data
      collection. There is no explicit statement that an external team led the study
      implementation or analysis without involvement by the intervention’s
      creators. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied. Hence, I is not met.
  p:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They reported the registry ID (AEARCTR-0003481), indicating it was formally
      pre-registered.
    quote: >-
      “This study is registered in the AEA RCT Registry under the unique identifier
      AEARCTR-0003481.” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Criterion P requires that the study be pre-registered before data collection.
      The paper explicitly states: “This study is registered in the AEA RCT Registry
      under the unique identifier AEARCTR-0003481.” (p. 2). This clarifies that
      the authors submitted a formal, publicly accessible registration in advance.
      Hence, the study meets the pre-registration requirement. Therefore, P is met.
