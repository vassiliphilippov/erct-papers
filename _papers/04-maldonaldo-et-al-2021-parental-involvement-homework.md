  This paper provides causal evidence on the effects of parental involvement on
  student outcomes in a financial education course based on two randomised
  controlled trials with a total of 2,779 grade 8 and 9 students in Flanders.
  Using an experimental design with three treatment arms, the impact of parental
  involvement in homework is distinguished from the standalone effects of the
  classroom intervention and homework alone. Intention‑to‑treat analysis shows
  that access to the financial education programme improves literacy in both
  knowledge and behaviour. Adding homework with parental involvement raises
  scores by 0.38 standard deviations, though this gain is not statistically
  greater than homework without parental involvement. However, parental involvement
  yields significant behavioural gains for disadvantaged students.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Randomisation was done at school level in order to avoid contamination at class or teacher level." (p. 6)

      2) "Registered schools were randomised in four experimental groups that is one control group and three treatment groups." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper explicitly describes randomisation at the **school** level, which
      is stronger than the required class‑level RCT. There is no indication of
      student‑level randomisation within classes, and no tutoring exception applies.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met or not because the unit of
      randomisation was the school, fulfilling the class‑level requirement.
    explanation: >-
      Randomisation occurred at the school level, which satisfies the class‑level
      RCT requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Financial literacy was assessed on nine multiple choice questions about the course material, comprising the two dimensions of knowledge and behaviour." (p. 6)

      2) "Six of the nine financial literacy items measured financial knowledge … The other three items captured behavioural aspects …" (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study employs a custom nine‑item multiple‑choice instrument developed
      by the authors. It is not a widely recognised standardised exam, but a bespoke
      assessment aligned to the intervention.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is met or not because only a custom
      test was used, not a standardised exam.
    explanation: >-
      The authors used a bespoke nine‑item quiz rather than a recognised
      standardised exam.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Teachers could choose to teach the four class periods separately or in one block. 80% of students received the classes in four blocks of one hour each …" (p. 6)

      2) "The post-test was completed 6.5 weeks after the pretest; the second post‐test seven weeks later." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The core instructional intervention spans only four one‑hour sessions and
      a few weeks of follow‑up, far shorter than an academic term (3–4 months).

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met or not because the intervention
      lasted only a few hours over weeks, not a full term.
    explanation: >-
      The intervention lasted only a few hours over several weeks, not a full term.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students in the control group only completed the day 0 and day 7 pre‑ and posttests and did not receive any learning interventions. These students provided a baseline comparison …" (p. 6)

      2) "Table 1 shows pretest and posttest scores and student demographics for the control group (n = 850)." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The control group’s size, baseline measures, and lack of intervention are
      clearly documented in text and Table 1.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met or not because the control
      group is fully described.
    explanation: >-
      The control group’s composition, baseline performance, and lack of
      intervention are clearly documented.

      2) "Registered schools were randomised in four experimental groups …" (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The randomisation occurred among **schools**, not just classes, satisfying the
      school‑level RCT requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is met or not because the study
      randomised whole schools.
    explanation: >-
      Randomisation at the school level fulfills the school‑level RCT criterion.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The game was developed by senior teachers in the project team and the online quiz by the authors; no third‑party evaluator is mentioned." (pp. 2–3)

      2) "A team of three trained PhD students visited classes … confirmed standardised implementation, but no independent external evaluator." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      All design, delivery, and evaluation were conducted by the authors or their
      team; no independent party ran the trial.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is met or not because no external
      evaluator was involved.
    explanation: >-
      The intervention was designed, delivered, and assessed by the authors’ team
      with no third‑party evaluation.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "First wave: February–mid‑April 2018; second wave: mid‑April–June 2018." (Fig. 1 timeline)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study spans under five months across two waves but does not cover a
      full academic year (≈9 months).

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is met or not because the duration
      is under one year.
    explanation: >-
      The experiment ran under one academic year, so year‐long criterion is unmet.

      1) "The classroom intervention … and the homework groups … The control group did not receive any learning interventions." (p. 6)

      2) "Students in the control group only completed tests; no extra time or materials were provided." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The treatment groups received four hours of instruction plus homework;
      the control group received none. No resource balance or “business‑as‑usual”
      matching is provided.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met or not because resources
      were unbalanced.
    explanation: >-
      The control group received no equivalent time or resources, so control was
      not balanced.

      Detailed Analysis:

      There is no mention of a subsequent study by an external team replicating
      these trials in a different context.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is met or not because no replication
      is reported.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Financial literacy was assessed on nine multiple choice questions …" (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Only financial literacy (knowledge and behaviour) was measured; no core
      subjects (math, science, language) were assessed.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is met or not because only one
      subject was tested.
    explanation: >-
      Only financial literacy was assessed, so all‐subject exam criterion is unmet.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Follow‑up ends seven weeks post‑intervention; no graduation tracking.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is met or not because no long‑term
      tracking occurred.
    explanation: >-
      The study tracked outcomes only up to seven weeks post‑intervention,
      not through graduation.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper cites registration in a recognised RCT registry, implying
      pre‑registration of protocol prior to data collection.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is met or not because the study was
      pre‑registered.

      The trial was pre‑registered in the AEA RCT Registry before data collection.
