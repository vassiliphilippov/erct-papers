abstract: >-
  This study aimed to examine the interventional effects of positive
  psychology expressive writing (PPEW) on adolescents’ time attitudes and
  mental health. A total of 285 adolescents from Northwest China (M =
  14.13, SD = 1.075; 53.3% female) were randomly assigned to either a
  PPEW group (n = 148) or a control group (n = 137). The PPEW group
  completed a six-week positive psychology expressive writing
  intervention, while the control group engaged in neutral writing
  tasks. All participants were assessed on time attitudes, positive
  affect, and depressive symptoms before and after the intervention.
  The results showed that, compared to the control group, the PPEW
  group scored significantly higher on Past Positive, Present Positive,
  and Future Positive, and significantly lower on Present Negative at
  post-test; however, a significant improvement in Past Negative was
  observed only within the PPEW group itself. Regarding mental health,
  depressive symptoms were significantly reduced in the PPEW group
  relative to the control group at post-test, but no significant change
  was observed in positive affect. In conclusion, positive psychology
  expressive writing can effectively foster the positive development of
  time attitudes in adolescents and may serve as a feasible approach to
  alleviating depressive symptoms.

  c:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization was at the individual participant level rather than
      at the class (or stronger) level, so class-level isolation is not
      ensured.
    quote: >-
      Randomization was conducted by an independent research assistant
      not involved in subsequent data collection or intervention
      delivery, using a computer-generated random number sequence to
      assign participants to either the PPEW intervention group or the
      control group.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A total of 285 adolescents from Northwest China (M = 14.13,
      SD = 1.075; 53.3% female) were randomly assigned to either a PPEW
      group (n = 148) or a control group (n = 137)." (Abstract)

      2) "Randomization was conducted by an independent research assistant
      not involved in subsequent data collection or intervention delivery,
      using a computer-generated random number sequence to assign
      participants to either the PPEW intervention group or the control
      group." (Section 2.3, Procedure)

      3) "During evening self-study sessions, participants in the PPEW
      group and the control group completed the writing tasks in their
      respective assigned classrooms." (Section 2.3, Procedure)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires random assignment at the class level (or a
      stronger cluster such as school), unless the intervention is
      explicitly one-to-one tutoring/personal teaching.

      The paper explicitly describes participant-level random assignment
      ("assign participants"), not assignment of intact classes or schools.
      The mention of completing tasks in "assigned classrooms" describes
      where tasks occurred, not the unit of randomization.

      Because the randomized unit is the individual adolescent, the study
      does not meet the ERCT requirement designed to reduce within-class
      contamination, and the tutoring exception does not apply.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is not met because individuals, not
      entire classes (or schools), were randomized.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured using self-report psychological scales, not
      widely recognized standardized exams.
    quote: >-
      Time attitude was assessed using the Chinese version of the
      Adolescent Time Attitude Scale (Li et al., 2021).
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Time attitude was assessed using the Chinese version of the
      Adolescent Time Attitude Scale (Li et al., 2021)." (Section 2.2.1)

      2) "Positive affect was assessed using the positive affect subscale
      of the Chinese version of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale for
      Children (Pan et al., 2025)." (Section 2.2.2)

      3) "Depressive symptoms were assessed using the depression symptoms
      subscale of the Chinese version of the Depression-Anxiety-Stress
      Scales-21 (DASS-21, Xie et al., 2022)." (Section 2.2.3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized exam-based assessments of
      educational achievement (e.g., national/state achievement tests),
      rather than self-report instruments measuring psychological
      constructs.

      This study’s outcomes are time attitudes, positive affect, and
      depressive symptoms, assessed via questionnaire scales (ATAS,
      PANAS-C, and DASS-21). These are not exam-based educational outcome
      measures.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because the study used
      self-report scales rather than standardized exam-based assessments.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention lasted six weeks and outcomes were measured
      immediately after it ended, which is shorter than one academic term.
    quote: >-
      Baseline assessments were completed before the intervention
      commenced, and post-intervention evaluations were conducted
      immediately after the program ended.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The PPEW group received a six-week positive psychology expressive
      writing intervention, administered once per week with each session
      lasting approximately 20 min (Nie et al., 2023)." (Section 2.4)

      2) "Baseline assessments were completed before the intervention
      commenced, and post-intervention evaluations were conducted
      immediately after the program ended." (Section 2.3, Procedure)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that outcomes be measured at least one full
      academic term after the intervention begins (typically ~3 to 4
      months), to assess persistence beyond a short immediate window.

      The paper states a "six-week" intervention and states outcomes were
      collected "immediately after the program ended." Six weeks is
      shorter than a typical academic term, and no additional term-length
      follow-up is described.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is not met because the start-to-measure
      interval was six weeks with immediate post-testing, not a full term.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The paper provides clear control-group description and baseline
      comparability information (sample sizes, demographics, and baseline
      equivalence tests).
    quote: >-
      Independent samples t-test and chi-square tests indicated no
      statistically significant differences between the groups in age
      (t = 0.91, p = 0.366), gender [χ2(1) = 0.93, p = 0.334], or grade
      level [χ2(1) = 0.59, p = 0.443], confirming successful randomization
      and baseline comparability.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Consequently, the final per-protocol analysis included 285
      participants (PPEW group: n = 148; control group: n = 137)."
      (Section 2.1, Participants)

      2) "The PPEW group comprised 148 participants (M = 14.07,
      SD = 1.063), including 65 males, 83 females, with 93 in Grade 7 and
      55 in Grade 10. The control group included 137 participants
      (M = 14.19, SD = 1.088), with 68 males, 69 females, 80 in Grade 7,
      and 57 in Grade 10." (Section 2.1, Participants)

      3) "Independent samples t-test and chi-square tests indicated no
      statistically significant differences between the groups in age
      (t = 0.91, p = 0.366), gender [χ2(1) = 0.93, p = 0.334], or grade
      level [χ2(1) = 0.59, p = 0.443], confirming successful randomization
      and baseline comparability." (Section 2.1, Participants)

      4) "The control group, within the same timeframe, completed writing
      tasks focused on describing neutral life details." (Section 2.4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control group be well documented,
      including who they are, their characteristics at baseline, and what
      they received as the control condition.

      The paper reports control-group size, demographics (age, gender,
      grade distribution), and includes statistical baseline equivalence
      checks. It also describes the control activity (neutral writing) and
      indicates it occurred in the same timeframe.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the control group’s
      composition, baseline comparability, and activities are clearly
      documented.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization assigned individual participants, not whole schools,
      so the study is not a school-level RCT.
    quote: >-
      Randomization was conducted by an independent research assistant not
      involved in subsequent data collection or intervention delivery,
      using a computer-generated random number sequence to assign
      participants to either the PPEW intervention group or the control
      group.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Randomization was conducted by an independent research assistant
      not involved in subsequent data collection or intervention delivery,
      using a computer-generated random number sequence to assign
      participants to either the PPEW intervention group or the control
      group." (Section 2.3, Procedure)

      2) "This study recruited participants through school-wide
      announcements, and both adolescent assent and parental written
      informed consent were obtained." (Section 2.3, Procedure)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization among schools (or equivalent
      institutional sites). The paper clearly describes recruitment in a
      school setting, but the randomization unit is explicitly the
      individual participant.

      There is no statement indicating that schools (or intact sites) were
      randomly assigned to intervention vs control.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met because randomization was not
      conducted at the school level.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      While randomization was done by an assistant and assessors were
      blinded, the paper does not document an external independent
      evaluation team separate from the intervention designers/authors.
    quote: >-
      Both assessment (questionnaire administration) and intervention
      delivery were carried out by two uniformly trained master’s students
      in psychology, with outcome assessors remaining blinded to
      participants’ group assignments throughout the study.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Randomization was conducted by an independent research assistant
      not involved in subsequent data collection or intervention delivery,
      using a computer-generated random number sequence to assign
      participants to either the PPEW intervention group or the control
      group." (Section 2.3, Procedure)

      delivery were carried out by two uniformly trained master’s students
      in psychology, with outcome assessors remaining blinded to
      participants’ group assignments throughout the study." (Section 2.3,
      Procedure)

      3) "Based on the analysis above, this study targets time attitude as
      the intervention focus (Tejada-Gallardo et al., 2022) and integrates
      positive psychology interventions with expressive writing to develop
      an intervention program termed positive psychology expressive
      writing (PPEW)." (Section 1.3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the study be conducted independently from
      the authors who designed the intervention, typically by an external
      evaluation team or organization.

      The paper includes safeguards (an "independent research assistant"
      for randomization and blinded outcome assessors). However, it does
      not clearly state that the evaluation was conducted by an
      independent third-party team separate from the intervention
      designers/authors; instead, delivery and assessment were performed
      by trained students within the study team context.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because independence from the
      intervention designers is not clearly established beyond limited
      task-specific roles (randomization and blinding).
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study ran for six weeks with immediate post-testing, which is
      far below 75% of an academic year, and it also fails Criterion T.
    quote: >-
      Baseline assessments were completed before the intervention
      commenced, and post-intervention evaluations were conducted
      immediately after the program ended.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The PPEW group received a six-week positive psychology expressive
      writing intervention, administered once per week with each session
      lasting approximately 20 min (Nie et al., 2023)." (Section 2.4)

      2) "Baseline assessments were completed before the intervention
      commenced, and post-intervention evaluations were conducted
      immediately after the program ended." (Section 2.3, Procedure)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires that outcomes be measured at least 75% of an
      academic year after intervention start. This study’s intervention
      and measurement window is six weeks with immediate post-testing,
      which is far shorter than an academic year.

      Additionally, per the ERCT dependency rule, if Criterion T is not
      met, Criterion Y is not met. Since T is not met here, Y cannot be
      met.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because the study’s
      start-to-measure interval is six weeks, not ~1 academic year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Both groups completed writing tasks on the same schedule and in the
      same setting with similar supervision, so time and implementation
      resources appear balanced.
    quote: >-
      The control group, within the same timeframe, completed writing
      tasks focused on describing neutral life details.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The PPEW group received a six-week positive psychology expressive
      writing intervention, administered once per week with each session
      lasting approximately 20 min (Nie et al., 2023)." (Section 2.4)

      2) "The control group, within the same timeframe, completed writing
      tasks focused on describing neutral life details." (Section 2.4)

      3) "During evening self-study sessions, participants in the PPEW
      group and the control group completed the writing tasks in their
      respective assigned classrooms." (Section 2.3, Procedure)

      4) "Each session began after a research assistant read out the
      standardized instructions, and was conducted under full supervision
      to ensure compliance, address any questions, and maintain the
      independence of task execution." (Section 2.3, Procedure)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B asks whether the intervention group received additional
      resources (time, budget, materials) that were not matched in the
      control group, unless extra resources were explicitly the treatment
      variable.

      Here, both groups performed writing tasks over the same six-week
      period, in classroom settings, with standardized instructions and
      supervision. The primary difference is the writing content (positive
      psychology themes vs neutral life details), not additional time or
      staffing resources.

      Under the Criterion B decision logic, the study does not show a
      meaningful additional time/budget advantage for the PPEW group; the
      implementation inputs appear comparable.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is met because both groups received
      comparable time and implementation resources, differing mainly in
      writing content.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent published replication of this specific 2026 PPEW RCT
      was identified, and the paper itself does not report a replication.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) (No statement about an independent replication of this PPEW trial
      is provided in the paper.)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires evidence that the same intervention and core
      design have been independently replicated by a different research
      team and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

      This article reports a single RCT and does not claim to be a
      replication of a prior trial, nor does it cite an external study
      that independently replicated this exact PPEW protocol.

      An internet literature search (by title, DOI, and key terms) did not
      identify an independent replication of this specific 2026 study as
      of the ERCT check date.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because there is no quoted or
      located evidence of an independent replication of this specific
      study.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Because the study does not use standardized exam-based outcomes
      (Criterion E not met), it cannot satisfy the all-subject exams
      requirement.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Time attitude was assessed using the Chinese version of the
      Adolescent Time Attitude Scale (Li et al., 2021)." (Section 2.2.1)

      2) "Positive affect was assessed using the positive affect subscale
      of the Chinese version of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale for
      Children (Pan et al., 2025)." (Section 2.2.2)

      3) "Depressive symptoms were assessed using the depression symptoms
      subscale of the Chinese version of the Depression-Anxiety-Stress
      Scales-21 (DASS-21, Xie et al., 2022)." (Section 2.2.3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all
      main school subjects. This study measures psychological constructs
      via questionnaires and does not report standardized academic exams.

      Per the ERCT dependency rule, if Criterion E is not met, Criterion A
      is not met. Since E is not met here, A must also be not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because there are no
      standardized exam-based measures, and therefore no all-subject exam
      coverage.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study explicitly reports no long-term follow-up, and because it
      also fails the year-duration requirement, it cannot meet graduation
      tracking.
    quote: >-
      Third, the study design did not include long-term follow-up or an
      intervention fidelity check.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Baseline assessments were completed before the intervention
      commenced, and post-intervention evaluations were conducted
      immediately after the program ended." (Section 2.3, Procedure)

      2) "Third, the study design did not include long-term follow-up or
      an intervention fidelity check." (Section 4, Discussion)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation from the
      relevant educational stage.

      This paper describes only immediate post-intervention assessment and
      explicitly notes that there was no "long-term follow-up." Therefore,
      it does not report tracking through any graduation milestone.

      Per ERCT dependency guidance, if Criterion Y is not met, Criterion G
      is not met. Since Y is not met (six-week duration), graduation
      tracking is necessarily not satisfied in this study.

      Additionally, an internet search for follow-up publications by the
      same author team tracking this cohort to graduation did not identify
      any such follow-up paper as of the ERCT check date.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because there is no long-term
      follow-up and no graduation tracking (and Y is not met).
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper provides ethics approval details but no evidence of a
      publicly pre-registered protocol (registry name/ID and timing).
    quote: null

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
      Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of
      Psychology at Northwest Normal University (Approval No: 2025012;

      Statement)

      2) (No pre-registration statement, registry ID, or registration date
      is provided in the paper.)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires a publicly pre-registered protocol with
      evidence that registration occurred before data collection began.

      The paper reports ethics approval, but it does not report any
      pre-registration registry entry (no registry name, no ID, and no
      registration date). Without a registry record, the timing
      requirement cannot be verified.

      An internet search for a registry record associated with this study
      (by title, authors, and key terms) did not identify a matching
      public pre-registration entry as of the ERCT check date.

      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met because the article does not
      report a public pre-registration registry entry or timing evidence.
