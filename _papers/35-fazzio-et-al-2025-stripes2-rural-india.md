abstract: "In common with many other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), India has witnessed a massive expansion in school enrolment over the last 20 years, and yet many students finish primary education without the foundational literacy and numeracy skills that would be expected as indicated by their grade and national curriculums. In the Support To Rural India's Public Education System (STRIPES) trial, a para-instructor intervention improved numeracy and literacy levels in Telangana, India (2008-10). The STRIPES2 trial was designed to assess whether a similar intervention in a younger cohort of children would have similar effects in Satna and Maihar districts of Madhya Pradesh, India, and be cost-effective. Methods: In this Madhya Pradesh cluster-randomized controlled trial, 196 villages (clusters) were randomized to receive either a health (CHAMPION2: community health promotion and medical provision and impact on neonates) or education (STRIPES2) intervention. Villages receiving the health intervention were controls for the education intervention and vice versa."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In this Madhya Pradesh cluster-randomized controlled trial, 196
      villages (clusters) were randomized to receive either a health
      (CHAMPION2: community health promotion and medical provision and
      impact on neonates) or education (STRIPES2) intervention." (p. 1)

      2) "Randomization of clusters was performed by the trial
      statistician based in London in June 2019 using a random number
      generator, with stratification by village size..." (p. 9)

      3) "In STRIPES2, the target group was children ... resident in the
      trial villages." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study explicitly describes itself as a cluster-randomized
      controlled trial where the unit of randomization was the "village"
      (cluster). All eligible children within the village were assigned to
      the condition of their village. This level of randomization
      (village) encompasses the schools and classes within that geographic
      unit, effectively operating at a level equal to or higher than the
      class or school. The ERCT standard accepts stronger school-level (or
      in this case, village-level) randomization as meeting the
      class-level criterion, as it prevents contamination between students
      in the same environment.

      Criterion C is met because randomization was performed at the
      village level, which is a cluster exceeding the class-level
      requirement.
    quote: "In this Madhya Pradesh cluster-randomized controlled trial, 196 villages (clusters) were randomized to receive either a health ... or education ... intervention."
    explanation: "The study randomized entire villages (clusters), satisfying the requirement for class-level or stronger randomization."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The primary outcome was the arithmetic mean of the child's
      scores on EGRA (Early Grade Reading Assessment) and EGMA (Early
      Grade Mathematics Assessment) tests [26,27]." (p. 8)

      2) "We chose to use EGRA and EGMA because of our positive
      experiences applying them in similar contexts ... and because they
      are widely used tests for assessing early grade literacy and
      numeracy." (p. 8)

      3) "The EGRA and EGMA protocols were adapted to the local context by
      the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER, [28]) and a
      board of local language and curriculum experts..." (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study used the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) and Early
      Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA). These are widely recognized,
      international standardized assessments for measuring foundational
      literacy and numeracy in early grades. The text confirms they were
      adapted to the local context by NFER (a recognized testing body),
      ensuring validity while maintaining the standardized framework.

      Criterion E is met because the study utilized widely recognized
      standardized exams (EGRA and EGMA) for assessment.
    quote: "The primary outcome was the arithmetic mean of the child's scores on EGRA (Early Grade Reading Assessment) and EGMA (Early Grade Mathematics Assessment) tests [26,27]."
    explanation: "The study used EGRA and EGMA, which are widely recognized standardized assessments."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In November 2019, Pratham started the 3-month preparatory phase
      for students' readiness." (p. 6)

      2) "Tests were conducted about one month after the intervention
      teams had stopped the main activities (between 24 July and 19
      September 2022)." (p. 10)

      3) "In some intervention arm villages, classes ran for up to 23
      months (October 2019 to March 2020, January 2021 to April 2021 and
      July 2021 to July 2022 (inclusive))..." (p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention spanned a significant period, beginning in late
      2019 and concluding with testing in mid-2022. Even accounting for
      COVID-19 interruptions, the active periods (e.g., July 2021 to July
      2022) far exceeded the minimum requirement of one academic term (3-4
      months). The outcomes were measured at the end of this multi-year
      process.

      Criterion T is met because the interval between intervention start
      and measurement covered multiple years, far exceeding one academic
      term.
    quote: "In some intervention arm villages, classes ran for up to 23 months (October 2019 to March 2020, January 2021 to April 2021 and July 2021 to July 2022 (inclusive))..."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Villages receiving the health intervention were controls for the
      education intervention and vice versa." (p. 1)

      2) "The villages receiving the CHAMPION2 intervention acted as
      controls for the STRIPES2 trial... encouraging STRIPES2 control
      children to give us data and attend the midline and endline tests
      even though they were not receiving any educational intervention."
      (p. 4)

      3) "Table 2. Baseline village characteristics... Table 3. Baseline
      child characteristics." (pp. 13-15)

      4) "In the control arm 3684 Children... 3667 Children (after
      duplicate removal)." (p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper provides detailed documentation of the control group. It
      explains the specific nature of the control group (they received a
      health intervention, CHAMPION2, but no educational intervention).
      Tables 2 and 3 explicitly list the demographic characteristics,
      sample sizes, and baseline data for the control arm alongside the
      intervention arm. The study clearly states the control group did not
      receive the educational program.

      Criterion D is met because the control group's characteristics,
      size, and treatment (health intervention only) are clearly
      documented.
    quote: "The villages receiving the CHAMPION2 intervention acted as controls for the STRIPES2 trial... even though they were not receiving any educational intervention."
    explanation: "The control group is well-documented, including demographics and confirmation that they received no educational intervention."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In this Madhya Pradesh cluster-randomized controlled trial, 196
      villages (clusters) were randomized..." (p. 1)

      2) "Randomization of clusters was performed... with stratification
      by village size..." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study randomized at the "village" level. In the context of this
      rural education intervention, the village unit encompasses the local
      schools and the eligible child population. Randomizing villages is a
      higher level of aggregation than randomizing individual schools
      within a city or classes within a school, and it effectively
      prevents contamination at the school level. The intervention was
      community-based (before/after school classes in the village), making
      the village the appropriate "site" or "unit" of implementation.

      Criterion S is met because the randomization was conducted at the
      village level, which satisfies the school-level requirement.
    quote: "In this Madhya Pradesh cluster-randomized controlled trial, 196 villages (clusters) were randomized to receive either a health ... or education ... intervention."
    explanation: "Randomization occurred at the village level, which serves as the implementation unit, satisfying the school-level RCT criterion."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "All data collection and related research activities for the
      STRIPES2 trial were organized by independent teams recruited,
      trained and monitored by GH Training and Consultancy (GHTC), India."
      (p. 4)

      2) "The intervention was designed and conducted by Pratham
      Foundation..." (p. 2)

      3) "GHTC recruited an independent team of test administrators for
      the Endline test. They were otherwise not involved in the trial and
      were unaware of the randomization." (p. 10)

      4) "Formal analysis: Nicholas Magill, Suzanne Keddie, Peter Boone,
      Chris Frost." (p. 30)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention was designed by the Pratham Foundation. The study's
      data collection was conducted by GHTC, an independent agency, using
      test administrators who were unaware of randomization. The analysis
      was performed by researchers from LSHTM and Effective Intervention
      (the funder), who are distinct from the Pratham implementation team,
      although they are co-authors. The criterion requires independent
      conduct to avoid bias in data collection/analysis. The use of an
      external agency (GHTC) for data collection and blinded test
      administrators explicitly meets the requirement for independent
      oversight.

      Criterion I is met because data collection was managed by an
      independent agency (GHTC) with blinded administrators.
    quote: "All data collection and related research activities for the STRIPES2 trial were organized by independent teams recruited, trained and monitored by GH Training and Consultancy (GHTC), India."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The period of the trial was extended with the primary outcome
      ... assessed around 30 months after classes started." (p. 1-2)

      2) "In some intervention arm villages, classes ran for up to 23
      months (October 2019 to March 2020, January 2021 to April 2021 and
      July 2021 to July 2022 (inclusive))..." (p. 13)

      3) "Tests were conducted ... between 24 July and 19 September 2022."
      (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention start date was late 2019, and the final measurement
      was in mid-2022. The active implementation periods, even when
      separated by COVID-19 lockdowns, cumulatively and chronologically
      cover significantly more than one academic year. The follow-up
      period from start to finish was approximately 30 months.

      Criterion Y is met because the study tracked outcomes over a period
      of roughly 30 months, exceeding the one-year requirement.
    quote: "The period of the trial was extended with the primary outcome ... assessed around 30 months after classes started."
    explanation: "The study assessed outcomes approximately 30 months after the intervention began, satisfying the year duration criterion."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The STRIPES2 trial was designed to assess whether a similar
      intervention ... would have similar effects ... and be
      cost-effective." (p. 1)

      2) "For children newly enrolled in primary school, the STRIPES2
      intervention comprised before/after-school classes (2 hours per day,
      6 days a week) given by trained para-instructors..." (p. 1)

      3) "Villages receiving the health intervention were controls for the
      education intervention... encouraging STRIPES2 control children to
      give us data... even though they were not receiving any educational
      intervention." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention group received significant additional resources:
      para-instructors, daily classes, and learning materials. The control
      group received a health intervention but no educational resources
      ("not receiving any educational intervention").

      To evaluate this against Criterion B, we apply the standard's logic:
      Is the additional resource (para-instructors/classes) the explicit
      treatment variable being tested? Yes. The study's stated goal is to
      "assess whether a similar intervention [the para-instructor model]
      ... would have similar effects." The additional resources are
      integral to the design and are the specific variable under
      investigation. Therefore, the control group represents the "business
      as usual" baseline required to measure the net effect of adding these
      resources. While there is an imbalance in educational inputs, it is
      intentional and integral to the research question.

      Criterion B is met because the additional resources (para-instructors
      and classes) were the explicit treatment variable being tested against
      a business-as-usual educational baseline.
    quote: "The STRIPES2 trial was designed to assess whether a similar intervention ... would have similar effects ... and be cost-effective."
    explanation: "The study explicitly tested the impact of the additional resources (para-instructor intervention) as the treatment variable."

      effective intervention: evidence from randomized evaluations of

      Research; 2016" (p. 31)

      Detailed Analysis:

      STRIPES2 is a reproduction of the original STRIPES trial. While the
      STRIPES2 team includes original researchers, the paper explicitly
      links the intervention ("Teaching at the Right Level" /
      para-instructors) to other independent studies, specifically citing
      Banerjee et al. (2016) [cite_start][cite: 11] and Banerjee et al. (2007) [cite_start][cite:
      17]. These citations refer to studies by the J-PAL team, which is a
      different research team from the Effective Intervention team leading
      STRIPES2, though they collaborate with the same implementation
      partner (Pratham). The intervention concept (TaRL/para-instructors)
      has been independently replicated in peer-reviewed journals.

      Criterion R is met because the intervention (Teaching at the Right
      Level/para-instructors) has been independently replicated and cited
      (e.g., Banerjee et al., 2016).
    quote: "Supplementary teaching with para-instructors and volunteers have shown large effects... India... [11,17]"

      2) "The STRIPES2 intervention aimed at building foundational
      literacy and numeracy skills for Grade 1 and 2 children..." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study assessed Literacy (Reading) and Numeracy (Mathematics).
      For the target demographic (Grade 1 and 2 students in rural India),
      these represent the core "main subjects" of the curriculum. There is
      no evidence of other main subjects (like Science or Social Studies)
      being standard or neglected at this specific educational stage in
      this context. Therefore, measuring both Reading and Math covers the
      main subjects.

      Criterion A is met because the study assessed both literacy and
      numeracy, which are the main subjects for Grade 1-2 students.
    quote: "The primary outcome was the arithmetic mean of the child's scores on EGRA (Early Grade Reading Assessment) and EGMA (Early Grade Mathematics Assessment) tests..."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We do not know if the effect of the intervention persisted after
      the intervention was completed as our study did not continue to
      conduct further follow-up." (p. 27)

      2) "Tests were conducted about one month after the intervention
      teams had stopped the main activities..." (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The criterion requires tracking participants until graduation. The
      authors explicitly state that they did *not* conduct further
      follow-up after the endline tests, which occurred shortly after the
      intervention ended. The children were in primary school grades and
      were not tracked through to the end of primary school graduation. An
      external search for follow-up papers yielded no results for this
      specific STRIPES2 cohort as of the review date.

      Criterion G is not met because the authors explicitly state that no
      follow-up was conducted after the intervention ended.
    quote: "We do not know if the effect of the intervention persisted after the intervention was completed as our study did not continue to conduct further follow-up."
    explanation: "The study explicitly states that no further follow-up was conducted after the intervention ended, failing the graduation tracking requirement."

      2) "The trial's protocol [20] and its amendment [21] were approved
      by the Ethics Committees..." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper cites a published protocol paper [20] (Agarwal et al.,
      2020) and an analysis plan. However, it does not provide a specific
      pre-registration registry ID (e.g., ISRCTN or ClinicalTrials.gov) or
      registration date in the text that definitively proves registration
      occurred before the initial data collection (enumeration) began in
      2017 or 2019. While the trial likely has a registry entry (e.g.,
      ISRCTN80596324), the paper does not confirm the timing relative to
      data collection start within the text provided, and strict adherence
      to the standard requires quoted evidence of pre-registration.

      Criterion P is not met because the paper does not provide a registry
      link or date in the text confirming pre-registration before data
      collection.
