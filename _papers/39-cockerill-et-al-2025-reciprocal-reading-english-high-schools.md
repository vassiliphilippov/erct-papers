  Targeted reciprocal reading instruction can lead to improved reading
  attainment. Though tested in elementary schools, the technique is less studied
  with older students. This paper reports results from a Phase 3 definitive
  trial designed to detect attainment gains previously identified in studies.
  The trial was conducted with students in 20 English high schools. Process data
  found the technique implementable by schools. Test data (n=733) found no
  significant differences between treatment and control groups, although the
  observed changes in treatment group students was of similar magnitude to
  those detected in a previous study. The effects of Covid19 are difficult to
  calculate, as this was an unusual time-period in the educational experiences
  of the sample, which may have resulted in atypical findings.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Randomisation was student-level, but the intervention is targeted small-
      group instruction outside normal English lessons, fitting the tutoring
      exception.
    quote: "Individual student participants were randomised to condition."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Up to 800 students were randomised to condition at the individual
      student level, recruited from 20 schools in England." (p. 4)

      2) "Individual student participants were randomised to condition." (p. 6)

      3) "The participating students aged 11 to 12 from sixth grade classes,
      engaged in Reciprocal Reading instruction in small groups of between 4-8,
      for 20-30 minutes once per week over two terms (approximately six months)
      during academic year 2021-2022." (p. 5)

      4) "It was recommended that treatment group students (up to 20 students
      selected per school) receive the intervention outside of English
      instruction time, and the school timetable the intervention prior to the
      start of the implementation period." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires class-level (or stronger) randomisation to reduce
      contamination, but the ERCT standard provides an exception when the
      intervention is "personal teaching like tutoring". Here, students are
      pulled into small groups (4-8) for targeted sessions, recommended to be
      scheduled outside English instruction time. This is closer to a tutoring-
      style delivery model than a whole-class instructional change, making
      student-level randomisation acceptable under the exception.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met because the study uses
      targeted small-group instruction outside normal English lessons, so the
      tutoring exception applies to student-level randomisation.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured using recognised standardised digital reading tests
      (NGRT and ART).
    quote: >-
      Primary outcome measure: New Group Reading Test (NGRT digital version)
      from GL-Assessment.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Primary outcome measure: New Group Reading Test (NGRT digital version)
      from GL-Assessment." (p. 7)

      2) "Secondary outcome measure: Access Reading Test (ART digital version)
      from RS Assessment, Hodder Education." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Both NGRT and ART are named, commercially available standardised reading
      assessments, and the paper describes them as adaptive tests with high
      reliability. The tests are not custom-built for this study, satisfying the
      ERCT requirement for standardised exam-based assessment.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is met because the study used
      recognised standardised assessments (NGRT and ART) rather than custom
      measures.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The outcome measurement occurred after approximately two terms
      (about six months), exceeding the one-term minimum.
    quote: >-
      After approximately two terms of intervention delivery, students then
      completed both reading tests as a post-test at the end of the intervention.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "One 30-minute session is delivered per week over approximately 6 months
      (two terms)." (p. 4)

      2) "After approximately two terms of intervention delivery, students then
      completed both reading tests as a post-test at the end of the
      intervention." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention and the time from start to post-test are described as
      approximately two school terms (about six months). This is longer than the
      ERCT minimum of one academic term (typically 3-4 months) from intervention
      start to outcome measurement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met because outcomes were
      measured after about two terms (around six months) from intervention
      delivery.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control group and its business-as-usual condition were described, and
      the paper reports baseline equivalence plus detailed counterfactual
      information about interventions used with control students.
    quote: >-
      During implementation, the control group students (up to 20 per school)
      continued with business as usual, comprising of their normal literacy and
      specific comprehension instruction practices for students aged 11 to 12
      years.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "During implementation, the control group students (up to 20 per school)
      continued with business as usual, comprising of their normal literacy and
      specific comprehension instruction practices for students aged 11 to 12
      years." (p. 5)

      2) "Staff from 11 schools reported specific intervention programmes used
      with control group students during the study." (p. 10)

      3) "No significant differences were found between control and treatment
      groups at pre-test on all scales of the primary and secondary outcome
      measures:" (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper describes the control condition as business as usual and gives a
      concrete counterfactual description by reporting survey-based information
      about literacy programmes used with control students. It also reports
      baseline equivalence at pre-test across primary and secondary outcome
      scales. Although demographic breakdowns are reported for the full analysed
      sample rather than by arm, the control condition, baseline status, and
      concurrent instruction are documented sufficiently for ERCT criterion D.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because the control
      condition is described as business as usual and is further documented via
      reported counterfactual programme use and baseline equivalence.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: "Randomisation was at the individual student level, not the school level."
    quote: "Individual student participants were randomised to condition."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Up to 800 students were randomised to condition at the individual
      student level, recruited from 20 schools in England." (p. 4)

      2) "Individual student participants were randomised to condition." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Although 20 schools participated, the unit of randomisation was the student
      within each school. Criterion S requires schools (not students) to be
      randomly assigned to conditions.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is not met because assignment was
      student-level rather than school-level.
  i:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention is attributed to Fischer Family Trust Literacy (FFTL),
      while the trial is authored by university researchers and funded by an
      independent foundation.
    quote: >-
      This approach was adapted into a targeted intervention by Fischer Family
      Trust Literacy (FFTL).
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This approach was adapted into a targeted intervention by Fischer
      Family Trust Literacy (FFTL)." (p. 1)

      2) "Materials: A teacher training program delivered by the program
      developer, which includes external school training (for teachers and
      support staff) interspersed with follow up school support/training."
      (p. 4)

      3) "The study was funded by a grant from the Nuffield Foundation [Grant
      reference number EDO/FR-000000363]." (p. 15)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper distinguishes the programme developer (FFTL) from the research
      team, and describes training delivered by the developer. The authors are
      affiliated with universities, and funding is from the Nuffield Foundation,
      supporting independence from the developer in evaluation and reporting.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is met because the intervention
      is developed by FFTL while the evaluation is conducted and funded
      independently of the developer.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured after approximately two terms (about six months),
      which is shorter than a full academic year.
    quote: "One 30-minute session is delivered per week over approximately 6 months (two terms)."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "One 30-minute session is delivered per week over approximately 6 months
      (two terms)." (p. 4)

      2) "After approximately two terms of intervention delivery, students then
      completed both reading tests as a post-test at the end of the
      intervention." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The tracking window from intervention delivery to post-test is explicitly
      described as about six months (two terms). This does not meet the ERCT
      requirement of at least one full academic year of tracking.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is not met because measurement
      occurred after about two terms rather than a full academic year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention adds time, training, and materials, but these resources
      are integral to the intervention being tested against business as usual.
    quote: "The program design includes both staff training and instruction delivery to students."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The program design includes both staff training and instruction
      delivery to students." (p. 4)

      2) "Staff teams received two training days focused on program delivery,
      with two additional support sessions (online) during implementation."
      (p. 4)

      3) "One 30-minute session is delivered per week over approximately 6 months
      (two terms)." (p. 4)

      4) "During implementation, the control group students (up to 20 per school)
      continued with business as usual, comprising of their normal literacy and
      specific comprehension instruction practices for students aged 11 to 12
      years." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Extra resources are clearly present: (a) additional staff training and
      support sessions, and (b) additional weekly small-group instructional
      sessions over roughly six months. The control group is business as usual
      and is not described as receiving matched time or training.

      Under the ERCT criterion B decision rule, this can still be "met" if the
      extra time/training is integral to what the study explicitly tests.
      The quotes show the intervention is defined as a package that includes
      training plus targeted instruction delivery. Therefore, the added
      resources are not incidental, they are part of the intervention
      definition, and the study is testing the effect of adding this package
      compared to standard practice.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met because added time and
      training are integral components of the intervention package being tested
      against business as usual.

    met: false
    explanation: >-
      I found no peer-reviewed independent replication of this specific high-
      school FFTL Reciprocal Reading evaluation by a different research team.
    quote: >-
      The same intervention was further adapted by the program developer for use
      with high school students and tested with positive results in a small Phase
      2 RCT study involving 14 English high schools (Thurston et al., 2020).
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "It was tested in 98 elementary schools with positive outcomes using
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) methodology (O'Hare et al., 2019)."
      (p. 1)

      2) "The same intervention was further adapted by the program developer for
      use with high school students and tested with positive results in a small
      Phase 2 RCT study involving 14 English high schools (Thurston et al.,
      2020)." (p. 1-2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper cites prior trials in primary schools and a Phase 2 RCT in high
      schools. These are not presented as independent replications by a separate
      research team of the Phase 3 evaluation reported here.

      After searching external sources, I did not find a peer-reviewed journal
      article by an independent team explicitly replicating this specific high-
      school FFTL Reciprocal Reading study and reporting comparable results.
      (I did find indications of new trials in progress, but not peer-reviewed
      replication results.)

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is not met because no independent
      peer-reviewed replication of this specific evaluation was found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: "Only reading outcomes were assessed; impacts on all main subjects were not measured."
    quote: >-
      Primary outcome measure: New Group Reading Test (NGRT digital version)
      from GL-Assessment.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Primary outcome measure: New Group Reading Test (NGRT digital version)
      from GL-Assessment." (p. 7)

      2) "Secondary outcome measure: Access Reading Test (ART digital version)
      from RS Assessment, Hodder Education." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      All reported outcome measures are reading assessments (NGRT and ART).
      There is no reporting of standardised outcomes in other main subjects
      (for example mathematics, science, or other curriculum areas).
      Criterion E is met, but criterion A requires coverage across main subjects.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because the study
      measures only reading rather than all main subjects.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study reports post-test at the end of the intervention and provides no
      evidence of tracking participants to graduation; also, criterion Y is not
      met so G cannot be met under the ERCT rules.
    quote: >-
      After approximately two terms of intervention delivery, students then
      completed both reading tests as a post-test at the end of the intervention.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "After approximately two terms of intervention delivery, students then
      completed both reading tests as a post-test at the end of the
      intervention." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper describes outcome measurement at post-test immediately at the
      end of the intervention window and does not describe any later follow-up
      to the end of schooling or graduation. I also searched for subsequent
      publications about this cohort and did not find evidence of graduation-
      level follow-up reporting.

      Additionally, the ERCT rules state that if criterion Y (Year Duration) is
      not met, then criterion G cannot be met. Since Y is not met here, G is not
      met regardless of whether later work might exist.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is not met because there is no
      reported tracking to graduation and the prerequisite year-duration
      criterion is not met.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The trial was registered after enrolment had begun, so it does not meet the
      requirement for a prospectively pre-registered protocol.
    quote: >-
      Registration date
      12/08/2021
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A research protocol was produced outlining the proposed design for this
      trial in accordance with the SPIRIT (2015) guidelines and was published
      prior to research completion in the International Journal of Educational
      Research (Cockerill et al., 2021)." (p. 3)

      Other Source Quotes (trial registry):

      2) "Registration date
      12/08/2021" (ISRCTN record, ISRCTN12090112, p. 1)

      3) "Date of first enrolment
      01/04/2021" (ISRCTN record, ISRCTN12090112, p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper reports that a protocol was produced and published, but ERCT
      criterion P requires that the study protocol be pre-registered before the
      study begins (prospectively), with registration timing prior to data
      collection/enrolment.

      The ISRCTN registry record for this trial reports a registration date of
      12/08/2021, while the same record reports the date of first enrolment as
      01/04/2021. Because registration occurs after enrolment began, the study
      is not prospectively pre-registered under the ERCT definition.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is not met because the registry
      shows registration after first enrolment, so the protocol was not
      prospectively pre-registered.
