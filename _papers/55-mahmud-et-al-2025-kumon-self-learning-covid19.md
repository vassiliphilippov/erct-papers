abstract: >-
  The COVID-19 pandemic and associated school closures exacerbated the global
  learning crisis, especially for children in developing countries. Teaching at
  the right level is gaining greater importance in the policy arena as a means
  to recover learning loss. This study forms part of an emerging body of work to
  examine the long-term effects of experimental educational interventions. In
  particular, we investigate the long-term effects of Kumon’s “self-learning at
  the right level” program, which was previously found to be effective in the
  short run in improving both the cognitive and non-cognitive abilities of
  disadvantaged students in Bangladesh. We revisit these students almost six
  years after the intervention followed by COVID-19 school closures. The
  program’s impact on non-cognitive abilities seems to remain perceptible,
  whereas its effect on cognitive abilities might have been attenuated. This
  suggests that such individualized self-learning interventions can effectively
  sustain students’ non-cognitive abilities amid academic disruptions.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: The original RCT randomized at the school level, which satisfies
      the class-level (or stronger) RCT requirement.
    quote: >-
      We introduced the Kumon method in randomly selected BPSs for grades 3 and
      4, covering 34 schools (17 treatment and 17 control schools) and
      approximately 1,000 students in total.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We introduced the Kumon method in randomly selected BPSs for grades 3
      and 4, covering 34 schools (17 treatment and 17 control schools) and
      approximately 1,000 students in total." (p. 2-3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires an RCT conducted at the class level (or stronger).
      The paper explicitly states that the Kumon method was introduced in
      "randomly selected" BRAC Primary Schools (BPSs), with 34 schools split into
      17 treatment and 17 control schools. Randomizing at the school level is
      stronger than class-level randomization and therefore satisfies Criterion
      C.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion C is met because randomization occurred at the school level,
      which is stronger than the required class-level design.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: The long-term follow-up cognitive outcome uses a custom rapid
      math test rather than a standardized exam.
    quote: >-
      Because we were unable to administer mathematics quizzes of the same type
      as the DT to comprehensively assess respondents’ cognitive abilities, we
      used rapid math tests as a proxy measure.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Because we were unable to administer mathematics quizzes of the same
      type as the DT to comprehensively assess respondents’ cognitive abilities,
      we used rapid math tests as a proxy measure." (p. 5)

      2) "The rapid assessment of cognitive abilities consists of seven math
      questions, which include slightly more difficult calculations than the
      original Kumon materials (see the Online Appendix E for the set of
      questions)." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized exam-based assessments that are widely
      recognized, not assessments created or assembled for the study. The paper
      states that the follow-up could not use the original diagnostic test and
      instead used a "rapid math test" as a proxy, consisting of seven math
      questions with the item set provided in an online appendix. This indicates
      a study-specific assessment rather than a standardized exam.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion E is not met because the follow-up cognitive measure is a custom
      rapid math test (seven questions), not a standardized exam.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: The intervention ran for eight months, exceeding a full academic
      term.
    quote: >-
      In the treatment schools, students were asked to join daily 30 min
      self-learning Kumon sessions before regular lessons of BPSs over 8 months.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In the treatment schools, students were asked to join daily 30 min
      self-learning Kumon sessions before regular lessons of BPSs over 8 months."
      (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcome tracking at least one academic term after the
      intervention begins (typically about 3-4 months). The paper describes the
      intervention as running "over 8 months," which is clearly longer than a
      single term.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion T is met because the intervention duration of 8 months exceeds
      the minimum one-term requirement.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: The paper documents the control group with baseline and
      follow-up descriptive statistics in Table 1.
    quote: >-
      Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics and the raw comparison between
      the treatment and control groups using an unconditional t-test for
      baseline scores, household characteristics (household size and household
      head’s age and education), and ‘‘endline’’ outcomes from the Phase 2
      survey in February 2022 (Fig. 1).
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics and the raw comparison between
      the treatment and control groups using an unconditional t-test for baseline
      scores, household characteristics (household size and household head’s age
      and education), and ‘‘endline’’ outcomes from the Phase 2 survey in February
      2022 (Fig. 1)." (p. 3)

      2) "DT score ... Control: 0.048" (Table 1, p. 4)

      3) "Household size ... Control: 4.265" (Table 1, p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control group be clearly documented,
      including baseline characteristics and outcomes. The paper explicitly
      points readers to Table 1 for descriptive statistics and raw comparisons
      between treatment and control groups, including baseline scores and
      household characteristics. Table 1 provides control-group values for
      multiple baseline measures (for example DT score and household size),
      satisfying the documentation requirement.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion D is met because the control group is documented with baseline
      and follow-up descriptive statistics in Table 1.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: Randomization is at the school level with 34 schools as clusters.
    quote: >-
      Clusters are schools at the baseline. There are 34 clusters.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We introduced the Kumon method in randomly selected BPSs for grades 3
      and 4, covering 34 schools (17 treatment and 17 control schools) and
      approximately 1,000 students in total." (p. 2-3)

      2) "Clusters are schools at the baseline. There are 34 clusters." (Table 1
      note, p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires an RCT conducted at the school level. The paper
      describes 34 schools split into treatment and control, and Table 1 notes
      that "Clusters are schools at the baseline," confirming school-level
      clustering consistent with school-level randomization.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion S is met because schools are the unit of randomization and
      clustering (34 schools).
  i:
    met: true
    explanation: The evaluation team is not the Kumon organization and the paper
      declares no conflict of interest.
    quote: >-
      The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest related to this
      study.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest related to
      this study." (p. 1)

      2) "We also thank the authorities of the BRAC, Kumon Institute of Education
      Co., Ltd., and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for
      cooperation in implementing the study." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the study be conducted independently of the
      intervention designers. The intervention is explicitly tied to "Kumon,"
      a program associated with Kumon Institute of Education Co., Ltd. The
      authors acknowledge Kumon Institute of Education Co., Ltd. for
      "cooperation," which is consistent with Kumon being an external partner
      rather than the evaluator. The paper further declares no conflict of
      interest. Based on these statements, the evaluation appears to be
      conducted by researchers outside the Kumon organization.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion I is met because the authors are not the intervention provider
      and they explicitly declare no conflict of interest.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: Outcomes are measured in a follow-up conducted six years after
      the original RCT period.
    quote: >-
      In 2022, we followed up students who joined an RCT study on self-learning
      at the right level from August 2015 to April 2016 (hereafter, the original
      RCT) after 6 years (Fig. 1).
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We revisit these students almost six years after the intervention
      followed by COVID-19 school closures." (p. 1)

      2) "In 2022, we followed up students who joined an RCT study on self-learning
      at the right level from August 2015 to April 2016 (hereafter, the original
      RCT) after 6 years (Fig. 1)." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least one academic year after
      the intervention begins. The paper states the original RCT ran from August
      2015 to April 2016 and that the follow-up occurred "after 6 years" in 2022.
      This far exceeds the one-year minimum.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion Y is met because the follow-up occurs about six years after the
      original intervention period began.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: The intervention adds time and materials, but these added
      resources are integral to the treatment being evaluated.
    quote: >-
      In the treatment schools, students were asked to join daily 30 min
      self-learning Kumon sessions before regular lessons of BPSs over 8 months.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In the treatment schools, students were asked to join daily 30 min
      self-learning Kumon sessions before regular lessons of BPSs over 8 months."
      (p. 3)

      2) "The intervention package included self-learning math worksheets,
      achievement tests, and record books to track progress." (p. 3)

      3) "In particular, we investigate the long-term effects of Kumon’s
      ‘‘self-learning at the right level’’ program ..." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B requires balanced time and resources across treatment and
      control unless the additional resources are explicitly integral to what is
      being tested. Here, the treatment is the Kumon "self-learning at the right
      level" program, which is defined as adding daily 30-minute sessions plus
      program materials (worksheets, achievement tests, record books). The paper
      frames the study goal as investigating the effects of this Kumon program.
      Because the extra time and materials are core components of the program
      itself (not an unrelated add-on), the study is explicitly evaluating the
      impact of providing this supplementary program relative to business as
      usual.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion B is met because the additional time and materials are integral
      components of the intervention being tested.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: No independent replication by a different research team was
      found for this specific Kumon RCT.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "There remain two important tasks for further investigations. First, it
      is imperative to test the external validity of the above findings, ad-
      dressing the caveats of attrition and the resulting selection bias." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication by a different research
      team, in a different context, published in a peer-reviewed journal. The
      paper itself does not report that an independent team replicated this
      specific Kumon RCT. In addition, an internet search focused on replications
      of the Bangladesh BRAC-school Kumon RCT did not identify a peer-reviewed
      reproduction study by different authors that clearly replicated the same
      intervention and design.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion R is not met because no independent, peer-reviewed replication of
      this specific RCT by a different research team was found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: Only mathematics was assessed (and not via standardized exams),
      so the study does not provide all-subject standardized exam outcomes.
    quote: >-
      The rapid assessment of cognitive abilities consists of seven math
      questions, which include slightly more difficult calculations than the
      original Kumon materials (see the Online Appendix E for the set of
      questions).
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The questionnaire contained questions on the learning status, a rapid
      assessment of cognitive abilities, non-cognitive survey questions, and
      questions on the risk preference, patience, and peer effect." (p. 3)

      2) "The rapid assessment of cognitive abilities consists of seven math
      questions, which include slightly more difficult calculations than the
      original Kumon materials (see the Online Appendix E for the set of
      questions)." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based measurement across all main
      subjects. This paper’s cognitive assessment in the follow-up is limited to
      mathematics (seven math questions) and does not report standardized exam
      outcomes across core subjects. Additionally, Criterion E is not met (the
      follow-up uses a custom rapid math test rather than a standardized exam),
      and by the ERCT rule, if E is not met then A cannot be met.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion A is not met because the study does not provide standardized exam
      outcomes across all core subjects.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: The paper does not show systematic tracking of participants
      through graduation for the full cohort.
    quote: >-
      The percentages do not add up to 100 because some of the students had
      graduated.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In 2022, we followed up students who joined an RCT study on self-learning
      at the right level from August 2015 to April 2016 (hereafter, the original
      RCT) after 6 years (Fig. 1)." (p. 2)

      2) "The percentages do not add up to 100 because some of the students had
      graduated." (Table 1 note, p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation. The paper
      reports a follow-up survey conducted about six years after the original
      RCT period and notes that "some of the students had graduated," but it does
      not describe a design where the cohort is tracked through graduation as an
      explicit endpoint for all participants. Instead, graduation appears as a
      status outcome observed at the time of the follow-up survey, alongside
      outcomes such as current attendance and dropout. Therefore, the paper does
      not provide evidence that participants were systematically followed until
      graduation for the whole cohort.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion G is not met because the study does not demonstrate cohort-wide
      tracking through graduation as a defined endpoint.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: The paper cites an AEA RCT Registry ID but does not provide (and
      we could not verify) a registration date before the study start.
    quote: >-
      The original study (Sawada et al. 2024) has been registered at the American
      Economic Association’s Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) registry
      (AEARCTR-0002925).
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The original study (Sawada et al. 2024) has been registered at the
      American Economic Association’s Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) registry
      (AEARCTR-0002925)." (p. 1)

      2) "In 2022, we followed up students who joined an RCT study on self-learning
      at the right level from August 2015 to April 2016 (hereafter, the original
      RCT) ..." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the protocol be pre-registered before the study
      begins. The paper provides a registry identifier (AEARCTR-0002925) but does
      not report the registry posting date. A targeted attempt to verify the
      registry entry details (including the registration date) using publicly
      accessible online sources did not yield a verifiable registration-date
      record for this specific ID. Without evidence that the registration date
      precedes the study start (August 2015), the pre-registration requirement is
      not satisfied under the ERCT standard.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion P is not met because a pre-intervention registration date could
      not be verified from the registry or the paper.
