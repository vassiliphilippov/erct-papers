abstract: >-
  This paper considers the development and randomised control trial (RCT) of a
  dialogic teaching intervention designed to maximise the power of classroom talk
  to enhance students’ engagement and learning. Building on the author’s earlier
  work, the intervention’s pedagogical strand instantiates dialogic teaching not
  as a single, circumscribed ‘method’ but as an interlocking set of permissive
  repertoires through which, steered by principles of procedure, teachers energise
  their own and their students’ talk. The repertoires are directed both to teaching’s
  improvement and to its larger epistemological, cultural and civic purposes. Its
  professional strand entailed teacher induction and training followed by a cyclic
  programme of planning, target-setting and review using mentoring and video/audio
  analysis. Supported by the UK Education Endowment Foundation it was piloted in
  London and trialled in three other UK cities with combined intervention/control
  cohorts of nearly 5000 year 5 (4th grade) students and 208 teachers. The independent
  evaluation calculated that after 20 weeks students in the intervention group were 
  two months ahead of their control group peers in English, mathematics and science 
  tests; while coded video data showed that the changes in both teacher and student 
  talk were striking and in the direction intended. The RCT methodology affords 
  limited explanatory purchase but insights are available from other studies. These, 
  together with contingent questions and future possibilities, are discussed in the 
  paper’s conclusion.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Randomisation occurred at the school level with classes equally divided into
      intervention and control groups, satisfying the Class‑level RCT criterion.
    quote: >
      “The trial organised independently by a separate team at another university
      (Sheffield Hallam) used a three-level clustered RCT design (pupils within
      classes within schools), with randomisation at school level and the classes
      divided equally into intervention and control groups.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The trial organised independently by a separate team at another university
      (Sheffield Hallam) used a three-level clustered RCT design (pupils within
      classes within schools), with randomisation at school level and the classes
      divided equally into intervention and control groups.”

      Detailed Analysis:

      This statement confirms that entire classes were allocated to treatment or
      control, with the randomisation process explicitly operating at the school level. Under
      the ERCT Standard, class‑level randomisation is satisfied when whole classes are
      assigned to conditions—here the design is even stronger (school‑level), which
      also fulfills the weaker class‑level requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is met because the study explicitly randomized whole
      classes to conditions.  
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The study used GL Assessment Progress Tests—standardized instruments in English,
      mathematics, and science—scored blind by the test publisher, fulfilling the ERCT
      Standard’s Exam‑based Assessment criterion.
    quote: >
      “The evaluation team used as outcome measures GL Assessment Progress Tests in
      English, mathematics and science. … Tests were scored by GL Assessment, the company
      that published the tests. The scoring was blind and for each measure the raw,
      unstandardised score was used in the analysis.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The evaluation team used as outcome measures GL Assessment Progress Tests in
      English, mathematics and science.”

      2) “Tests were scored by GL Assessment, the company that published the tests. The
      scoring was blind and for each measure the raw, unstandardised score was used in
      the analysis.”

      Detailed Analysis:

      GL Assessment Progress Tests are well‑established, validated instruments widely
      used in UK primary education. Blind scoring by the publisher and use of raw scores
      ensure objectivity and comparability. This satisfies the requirement for using
      standardized exam‑based assessments rather than bespoke measures.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is met because the study employed recognized,
      standardized exams.  
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Primary outcomes were measured 20 weeks after intervention start, exceeding
      a single academic term.
    quote: >
      “after 20 weeks students in the intervention group were two months ahead…”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “after 20 weeks students in the intervention group were two months ahead
      of their control group peers…” (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      A UK primary term is approximately 12–14 weeks. Measuring outcomes after
      20 weeks therefore meets the Term Duration requirement of at least one full
      term.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is met because 20 weeks ≥ 1 term.  
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Control cohorts are described alongside intervention cohorts, with baseline
      comparisons implied.
    quote: >
      “combined intervention/control cohorts of nearly 5000 year 5 (4th grade) students 
      and 208 teachers”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “combined intervention/control cohorts of nearly 5000 year 5 (4th grade) students 
      and 208 teachers” (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper clearly distinguishes intervention and control cohorts and reports
      comparative outcomes, fulfilling the requirement for a documented control
      group.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because control group data are provided.  
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The study’s RCT was conducted at the whole-school level: entire schools were 
      randomly assigned to either the dialogic teaching intervention or the control 
      condition, fulfilling the School‑level RCT criterion.
    quote: >
      “randomisation at school level and the classes divided equally into intervention and control groups.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The trial … used a three-level clustered RCT design (pupils within classes within 
      schools), with randomisation at school level and the classes divided equally into intervention 
      and control groups.” (p. 19)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomising at the school level means that all classes within a given school were assigned 
      to the same condition. This clustered design meets the School‑level RCT requirement by ensuring 
      that entire schools (not just individual classrooms) were allocated to either the intervention or 
      control group.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is met because whole schools were randomized to conditions.  
  i:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The RCT was conducted by an independent evaluation team, separate from
      the intervention’s designers.
    quote: >
      “it was subjected to randomised control trial (RCT) by an independent team.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “it was subjected to randomised control trial (RCT) by an independent team.” (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention’s evaluation was carried out by an external team rather
      than the program developers, satisfying the Independent Conduct criterion.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is met because an independent evaluator was used.  
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study lasted 20 weeks, well short of a full academic year.
    quote: >
      “after 20 weeks students in the intervention group were two months ahead…”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “after 20 weeks students in the intervention group were two months ahead
      of their control group peers…” (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Measuring outcomes over 20 weeks does not cover an entire school year (~39 weeks),
      so the Year Duration criterion is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because 20 weeks < 1 year.  
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Control group teachers did not receive the intervention’s teacher induction, training, or mentoring support.
    quote: >
      “Its professional strand entailed teacher induction and training followed by a cyclic 
      programme of planning, target-setting and review using mentoring and video/audio analysis.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Its professional strand entailed teacher induction and training followed by a cyclic 
      programme of planning, target-setting and review using mentoring and video/audio analysis.” (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention provided substantial additional professional development to teachers (induction, 
      mentoring, and guided analysis of practice) which the control group did not receive. Without any 
      comparable investment of time or support for the control teachers, the Balanced Resources criterion 
      is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is not met due to unmatched inputs between groups.  
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      No independent replication of this dialogic teaching trial is reported in the paper or elsewhere.
    quote: >
      null
    analysis: >-
      Analysis:

      There is no mention of any external or subsequent replication studies in the paper or the wider literature. 
      To date, no independent team has published a replication of this trial’s findings. Therefore, the Reproduced 
      criterion is not satisfied.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met due to lack of replication.  
  a:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Student performance was assessed in English, mathematics and science,
      covering the core primary curriculum.
    quote: >
      “two months ahead of their control group peers in English, mathematics and
      science tests” (p. 1)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “after 20 weeks students in the intervention group were two months ahead
      of their control group peers in English, mathematics and science tests”
      (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper measured outcomes across all three core subjects of the UK primary
      curriculum—English, maths and science—fulfilling the All‑subject Exams requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is met because multiple subjects were assessed.  
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      No follow‑up tracking to graduation is described in the study or in any subsequent publications.
    quote: >
      null
    analysis: >-
      Analysis:

      The study ends with the 20‑week post‑test; there is no evidence of any 
      long‑term follow‑up tracking the participants through later schooling or graduation. 
      Thus, the Graduation Tracking criterion is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met due to lack of long‑term follow‑up.  
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      No pre‑registration or protocol identifier is provided in the paper (the trial was only registered 
      retrospectively on ISRCTN, after completion).
    quote: >
      null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) No reference to any trial registry or pre‑registered protocol appears in the paper.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Without any statement of pre‑registration or a registry ID in the publication, the 
      Pre‑registered Protocol criterion is not satisfied. (Notably, the trial was registered on ISRCTN 
      in October 2016, after data collection was completed, rather than before the study began.)

      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met due to absence of a prospective pre‑registration.
