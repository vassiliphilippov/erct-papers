abstract: >-
  The use of self-led educational technologies holds significant potential for
  improving student learning at scale, but sustaining student engagement with
  these platforms remains a challenge. We present results from an experimental
  evaluation implemented following the scale-up of a math platform in Peru,
  where primary school teachers received weekly WhatsApp messages summarizing
  their students’ platform activity and encouraging them to promote engagement.
  The messages increased the average weekly share of students using the platform
  by 5 percentage points (a 17% increase) and the average share of math
  exercises completed by 4 percentage points (a 16% increase). Effects
  dissipated once the messages stopped, suggesting that salience and simplified
  monitoring are likely mechanisms. We find little evidence of impact
  heterogeneity based on teacher characteristics or students’ prior platform use
  and achievement. Non-experimental evidence suggests that increased use of the
  student math platform improved math learning. Overall, our findings indicate
  that light-touch communication with teachers can cost-effectively strengthen
  engagement with EdTech platforms scaled through the education system.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The unit of randomization is the teacher (classroom), meeting the
      class-level RCT requirement.
    quote: >-
      Teachers were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which
      received weekly WhatsApp messages about their students’ platform use, or
      to a control group.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To evaluate whether this type of teacher-facing messaging can improve
      student engagement with complementary learning tools, we conducted a
      randomized controlled trial with 853 teachers of grades 4 through 6 in
      Peru." (p. 2)

      2) "Teachers were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which
      received weekly WhatsApp messages about their students’ platform use, or
      to a control group." (p. 2)

      3) "We report heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the
      teacher level, the unit of randomization." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT C criterion requires random assignment at the classroom level or
      higher (or the tutoring exception). Here, the paper states that teachers
      were randomized. In primary schooling, a teacher corresponds to a
      classroom, so treatment assignment is effectively at the class level, not
      within-class student assignment. The analysis also treats the teacher as
      the unit of randomization (clustered standard errors), which is consistent
      with a class-level RCT.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is met because teachers (classrooms) were
      randomly assigned to treatment and control.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The RCT’s primary outcomes are platform usage logs, not standardized exam
      scores; any test-score analysis is non-experimental.
    quote: >-
      The experimental variation was not designed to allow measurement of
      downstream impacts on test scores.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The experimental variation was not designed to allow measurement of
      downstream impacts on test scores." (p. 2)

      2) "We construct three primary outcomes." (p. 4)

      3) "However, we can use non-experimental variation to examine learning
      outcomes." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires that the RCT measures outcomes with standardized
      exam-based assessments. The paper explicitly states that the experiment
      was not designed to measure impacts on test scores. The experimental
      outcomes are administrative usage metrics from the platform (connection
      and exercises). The paper does report an "endline math test" for a
      separate, non-experimental topic-exposure analysis, but this is not the
      experimental outcome and is not described as a standardized national exam.
      Therefore, the study does not satisfy the ERCT requirement for exam-based
      assessment within the RCT.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because the RCT outcomes are
      platform-use metrics rather than standardized exams.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes are tracked from the May 30 start through November 2022,
      exceeding one academic term.
    quote: >-
      We use comprehensive administrative data recorded by the math learning
      platform, spanning from March to November 2022.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The 8-week intervention began the week of May 30 and concluded in
      mid-July 2022." (p. 4)

      2) "We use comprehensive administrative data recorded by the math learning
      platform, spanning from March to November 2022." (p. 4)

      3) "Panel C: Delayed post-intervention (weeks 19–27)" (Table 2, p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcome measurement at least one full academic term
      (roughly 3–4 months) after the intervention begins. The intervention
      started the week of May 30. The dataset spans through November 2022, and
      the main experimental results are reported through a delayed
      post-intervention window of weeks 19–27. From late May to late November is
      about six months, which exceeds a term.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is met because the follow-up period from the
      start of the intervention to the latest outcomes is about six months.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control group is clearly defined (no messages) and baseline
      characteristics for treatment and control are documented.
    quote: >-
      The control group received no messages.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The control group received no messages." (p. 4)

      2) "Table 1 presents summary statistics on pre-treatment school and
      teacher characteristics for both the treatment and control groups, along
      with balance tests." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control condition and its baseline
      characteristics are documented well enough to assess comparability. The
      paper explicitly states the control condition (no WhatsApp messages). It
      also provides baseline balance and summary statistics for treatment and
      control, including school and teacher characteristics and pre-treatment
      platform-use measures (Table 1).

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the control condition is
      clearly defined and baseline balance is documented.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: 'Randomization was performed at the teacher level, not at the school level.'
    quote: >-
      Among the 853 teachers in the final sample, 600 were randomly assigned to
      the treatment group and 253 to the control group.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Teachers were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which
      received weekly WhatsApp messages about their students’ platform use, or
      to a control group." (p. 2)

      2) "Among the 853 teachers in the final sample, 600 were randomly assigned
      to the treatment group and 253 to the control group." (p. 4)

      3) "We report heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the
      teacher level, the unit of randomization." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level randomization. The paper repeatedly
      identifies the teacher as the unit of randomization and clusters standard
      errors at the teacher level. There is no statement that entire schools
      were assigned to treatment or control. Therefore, this is not a
      school-level RCT.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met because randomization occurred at
      the teacher (classroom) level rather than the school level.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The lead author holds IP rights to the software being promoted, so the
      study is not independent of the intervention’s owner/designer.
    quote: >-
      Roberto Araya is a researcher at Universidad de Chile and the owner of
      Automind, the company that holds the intellectual property rights of the
      Conecta Ideas software.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Roberto Araya is a researcher at Universidad de Chile and the owner of
      Automind, the company that holds the intellectual property rights of the
      Conecta Ideas software." (p. 11)

      2) "The implementation of the Conecta Ideas Peru program was carried out
      by the research center GRADE." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires independent conduct, meaning the evaluation should
      be carried out independently from the intervention designers/owners to
      reduce conflicts of interest. The competing-interests statement says the
      first author owns the company holding the platform’s intellectual
      property. Even if implementation in Peru was carried out by GRADE, the
      direct ownership stake of a co-author in the platform being promoted
      means the evaluation is not independent under this criterion.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because a co-author owns the IP for
      the platform central to the study.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study tracks outcomes for less than a full academic year
      (March–November), falling short of year-duration tracking.
    quote: >-
      We use comprehensive administrative data recorded by the math learning
      platform, spanning from March to November 2022.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The school year runs from March to December." (p. 3)

      2) "We use comprehensive administrative data recorded by the math learning
      platform, spanning from March to November 2022." (p. 4)

      3) "The 8-week intervention began the week of May 30 and concluded in
      mid-July 2022." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement for at least one full academic
      year after the intervention begins. The paper describes the Peruvian
      school year as March to December. The available platform data used in the
      study span March through November, and the intervention begins at the end
      of May. This does not cover a full academic year of follow-up from the
      intervention start, nor does it cover the complete March to December
      school year in outcomes.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because outcomes are tracked for
      only part of the school year (up to November) rather than a full academic
      year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The only additional resource is the WhatsApp messaging itself, which is
      the treatment being tested; the control group is business-as-usual by
      design.
    quote: >-
      This study estimates the impact of sending weekly WhatsApp messages to
      teachers with information about their students’ use of the learning
      platform.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study estimates the impact of sending weekly WhatsApp messages to
      teachers with information about their students’ use of the learning
      platform." (p. 4)

      2) "The control group received no messages." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B checks whether extra time/budget/resources given to the
      intervention group are balanced in the control group, unless those extra
      resources are explicitly the treatment variable. Here, the intervention
      is the provision of weekly WhatsApp messages to teachers. The control
      condition is explicitly "no messages." The messages are not an auxiliary
      add-on to a different educational intervention; they are the
      intervention being tested. Under the ERCT decision tree, this
      corresponds to the case where extra resources are present and are
      integral to the design (the resource is the treatment), so an
      unaugmented control group is acceptable.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is met because the additional resource
      (messages) is the treatment variable being tested.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No peer-reviewed independent replication of this WhatsApp-to-teachers
      messaging RCT was found in a web search as of the ERCT check date.
    quote: >-
      An earlier experimental evaluation in Chile found platform use led to a
      0.27 standard deviation (s.d.) increase in test scores (Araya et al.,
      2025).
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "An earlier experimental evaluation in Chile found platform use led to
      a 0.27 standard deviation (s.d.) increase in test scores (Araya et al.,
      2025)." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires independent reproduction of this study (the teacher
      WhatsApp messaging intervention) by other authors in a peer-reviewed
      journal. The paper cites prior experimental work on the underlying
      platform in Chile, but that is a different intervention (platform use in
      school time) and involves overlapping authorship. Using web searches for
      this paper’s title, DOI, and keywords (WhatsApp, teacher messaging,
      Conecta Ideas, Peru), no peer-reviewed replication studies by independent
      teams were identified. Because the existence of a replication cannot be
      established from the available sources, the criterion remains not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because no independent
      peer-reviewed replication of the messaging intervention was found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Only mathematics outcomes are discussed, and criterion E is not met, so
      the all-subject standardized exam requirement is not satisfied.
    quote: >-
      The Conecta Ideas platform offered weekly math problems to primary school
      students, aligned with the national curriculum.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The national curriculum includes core subjects such as math, language,
      science, and social studies, along with specialized subjects like art and
      physical education." (p. 3)

      2) "The Conecta Ideas platform offered weekly math problems to primary
      school students, aligned with the national curriculum." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all main
      subjects. The paper’s intervention and outcome discussion are focused on
      mathematics. More importantly, ERCT rules make criterion E a prerequisite:
      if the study does not use standardized exam-based outcomes in the RCT,
      criterion A cannot be met. Since the RCT outcomes are platform usage
      rather than standardized exams (criterion E not met), the study
      necessarily fails criterion A. There is also no evidence that
      standardized exams were collected across language, science, or other core
      subjects.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because the study does not provide
      all-subject standardized exam outcomes, and criterion E is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Students are followed only within the 2022 school year and not until
      graduation; criterion Y is also not met, which implies G cannot be met.
    quote: >-
      After the messages ended in week 8, the gap in platform use between
      treatment and control classrooms gradually narrowed and was no longer
      statistically significant by the end of the school year.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "After the messages ended in week 8, the gap in platform use between
      treatment and control classrooms gradually narrowed and was no longer
      statistically significant by the end of the school year." (p. 2)

      2) "We use comprehensive administrative data recorded by the math learning
      platform, spanning from March to November 2022." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation, potentially
      described in follow-up publications by the same authors. In this paper,
      tracking and reported effects are confined to the 2022 school year (data
      through November). A targeted web search for follow-up studies reporting
      graduation outcomes for this Peruvian cohort (grades 4–6 in 2022) did not
      identify any publication that follows the same participants through the
      end of primary school. Additionally, ERCT rules specify that if criterion
      Y (year duration) is not met, criterion G cannot be met.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because the study does not track
      students to graduation and no follow-up graduation paper was found.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No pre-registration identifier or registry entry could be located for
      this RCT in the paper or via a web search.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) No statement about trial pre-registration or a registry ID was found in
      the paper.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the study protocol be pre-registered before the
      study begins, and that the registry record can be verified (registration
      date before data collection). The paper does not mention pre-registration,
      a registry name, or an ID. A web search for a corresponding registry entry
      (including the AEA RCT Registry / Social Science Registry) using the paper
      title, DOI, author names, and keywords did not yield a public
      pre-registration record that can be verified for timing.

      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met because no verifiable
      pre-registration record was found.
