  Background: Flipped learning excessively boosts students’
  understanding through reversed arrangements of pre-learning and
  in-class learning events. Using a gamification method in flipped
  classrooms can help students stay motivated and achieve their goals.
  Methods: A randomized controlled trial design with pre-test and
  post-test was adopted, involving 128 nursing students randomly divided
  into study and control groups. Moodle was gamified for 6 weeks in the
  intervention group. Results: Significant differences were observed in
  students’ self-confidence, skills knowledge, preparation intensity, and
  motivation. Conclusions: Gamified flipped classrooms improved
  motivation, preparation, knowledge, and self-confidence compared with
  traditional flipped classrooms. The trial was prospectively registered
  (NCT04859192).

    explanation: >-
      Randomization was performed at the student level rather than at the
      class or school level, and no tutoring exception applies.
    quote: >-
      “...involved 128 nursing students... randomly divided into the study and
      control groups.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      (1) “This study adopted a randomized controlled study
      design with a pre-test and post-test and involved 128 nursing students at
      Mansoura University … This study randomly divided the students into the
      study and control groups.” (Methods section) 
      
      (2) “Participants were
      recruited from … The students … who were willing to participate were
      involved. This study required an a priori sample size of 128 students, who
      were randomly divided into two groups … using block randomization with a
      block size of 4.” (Subjects section)
      
      The ERCT Standard’s Class-level RCT (C) criterion requires
      that entire classes (or schools, if stronger) be randomly assigned to
      treatment or control, preventing contamination between students in the
      same classroom. The paper, however, indicates that randomization occurred
      at the student level. Specifically, the authors describe that 128
      students were randomly allocated into two conditions via block
      randomization. No statement appears that entire classes were assigned.
      
      Because the intervention was introduced to
      individual students, it raises the risk of potential contamination—
      students in the same classroom might share experiences or resources.
      Moreover, the standard allows an exception for tutoring or purely
      one-to-one interventions; however, this study used a broader class-based
      instruction approach with half of the students receiving the gamified
      platform and the other half the standard flipped classroom, all
      presumably in parallel labs. Thus, no recognized exception from the
      standard applies.
      
      Given that the randomization was not done at the class
      level (and no valid exception is cited), the “Class-level RCT” criterion
      is not satisfied.

    explanation: >-
      They used researcher-developed quizzes and observation checklists instead
      of standard external exams.
    quote: >-
      “Tool V… three formative quizzes for each timepoint… developed by the
      researchers… each consisted of 20 questions.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      (1) “Six tools were used in this study.” (Methods section)
      
      (2) “Tool V: Fundamentals of nursing II knowledge tests… The scoring
      system was implemented by adding five points to every right answer and 0
      points to every incorrect answer.” (Methods section)
      
      The ERCT Standard requires the use of standardized,
      well-established exams independent of the research team’s custom design.
      Such exams ensure objectivity and comparability across different contexts.
      In this study, the authors developed or adapted their own tools to measure
      knowledge (for example, “Three formative quizzes … each consisted of 20
      questions.”).
      
      There is no mention of recognized standardized exams
      (e.g., national or state tests) for assessing skill or knowledge outcomes.
      Instead, the quizzes and checklists were prepared by the researchers
      specifically for this study, focusing on the specific content of the
      nursing skills and the fundamentals course.
      
      Because the assessment instruments are custom-made for
      this project and not previously validated large-scale standardized exams,
      the E (Exam-based Assessment) criterion is not met.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention was about 11 weeks, which does not clearly encompass a
      full 3- to 4-month academic term.
    quote: >-
      “...the assistant staff gathered data for 11 weeks at three timepoints in
      the second academic semester...”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      (1) “The assistant staff gathered data for 11 weeks at
      three timepoints in the second academic semester (2020–2021).”
      (Methods section)
      
      (2) “Timepoint 0 (T0) covers the first 2 weeks, and
      timepoints 1 (T1) and 2 (T2) cover the subsequent 3 weeks.” (Fig. 1)
      
      According to the ERCT Standard, an intervention must last
      for at least one full academic term (commonly 3–4 months) to satisfy the T
      criterion. The paper states that the study spanned a total of 11 weeks
      during the second semester.
      
      Eleven weeks is approximately 2.5 months, which is
      slightly under the standard three-month threshold typically defining a full
      academic term or semester. Although the authors mention that it occurred in
      the second semester, the intervention plus data collection does not clearly
      cover an entire 3- to 4-month term.
      
      Because the described duration is somewhat shorter than the
      typical full term criterion (3+ months) and is not explicitly stated as a
      complete academic term, T is not fully met.

      They provide demographic details for the control group and describe what the
      control group received (standard FC).
    quote: >-
      “...No substantial differences in sex, secondary school location, economic
      status ... were observed between the two groups.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      (1) “Data were collected ... in the intervention and
      control groups ... randomization was performed by an independent
      statistician.” (Methods section) 
      
      (2) “An a priori sample size of 128...
      demographic characteristics... No substantial differences in sex,
      secondary school location, economic status ... were observed between the
      two groups.” (Results section)
      
      The ERCT Standard’s Documented Control Group (D)
      criterion requires a clear description of the control group’s baseline and
      demographics, plus verification that the control participants received
      ‘business-as-usual’ or some standard approach.
      
      This paper provides a thorough demographic table
      (Table 1) comparing the groups for sex, economic status, prior academic
      performance, etc. The authors also specify that the control group continued
      with the usual flipped classroom (without gamification).
      
      Because the authors provide clear details about how many
      students were in the control group, their demographic backgrounds,
      baseline equivalence checks, and exactly what the control group did
      (standard flipped classroom approach), the D criterion is satisfied.

    explanation: >-
      They randomized individual students, not entire schools.
    quote: >-
      “...128 nursing students... randomly divided into... study and control
      groups.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      (1) “This study randomly divided the students into the
      study and control groups…” (Methods section)
      
      The S (School-level RCT) criterion requires that entire
      schools be the unit of randomization, ensuring that each participating
      school is fully assigned to either the intervention or control.
      
      The present study involves a single faculty of nursing at
      one university, and randomization was carried out at the individual-student
      level (block randomization) rather than assigning entire schools. There is
      no mention of multiple schools being randomized.
      
      Because randomization is not done among schools but among
      students, the S requirement is not met.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Only fundamentals of nursing skills and knowledge were tested; no 
      assessment of other main subjects.
    quote: >-
      “...quiz 1 covered oral medication administration and intramuscular injection; 
      quiz 2 covered range of motion exercises...”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      (1) “This study… examines the effect on Fundamentals of 
      Nursing students’ skills competency...” (Abstract)
      
      (2) “Each consisted of 20 
      questions: quiz 1 covered oral medication administration and intramuscular 
      injection; quiz 2 covered range of motion exercises and subcutaneous and 
      intradermal injections.” (Methods section)  
      
      The A (All-subjects Exam-based) criterion entails measuring 
      outcomes in all main subject areas — such as math, language, and science in a 
      general education context — or providing a justification if focusing on a 
      specialized/vocational subject. The standard also expects the use of 
      well-established, standardized exams.  
      
      In this study, the evaluation is narrowly focused on the 
      Fundamentals of Nursing course. The authors measured knowledge and performance 
      only for specific nursing skills (e.g., oral medication administration, 
      injection procedures, range-of-motion exercises). They did not assess outcomes 
      in any other subject or course, nor did they use a national standardized exam.  
      
      Because the study assessed only a single domain (nursing 
      fundamentals) and did not cover additional subjects or use external standardized 
      exams, the All-Subjects Exam-based Assessment criterion is not satisfied.
  y:

    explanation: >-
      They ran the intervention for roughly 11 weeks, far shorter than a year.
    quote: >-
      “...the assistant staff gathered data for 11 weeks at three timepoints in
      the second academic semester (2020–2021).”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      (1) “A randomized controlled design with a pre-test and
      post-test ... data collection lasted 11 weeks...” (Methods section)
      
      (2) “In the second academic semester (2020–2021).” (Methods section)
      
      The Y (Year Duration) criterion requires the intervention
      to last for at least one full academic year—roughly 9–10 months—before
      concluding final outcome measures.
      
      The paper clearly states that the entire study spanned a
      single partial semester (about 11 weeks). There is no indication that they
      continued the trial or follow-up for a full academic year.
      
      Since the total intervention was only a fraction of an
      academic year, the Y criterion is not fulfilled.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention group received multiple gamified features not mirrored in
      the control group with no extra resource equivalence.
    quote: >-
      “...The control group did not receive any intervention, except for their
      routine FC education.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      (1) “In the intervention group, Moodle was gamified for 6
      weeks...” (Methods section)
      
      (2) “The control group ... did not receive any
      intervention, except for their routine FC education.” (Methods section)
      
      B (Balanced Control Group) means that if extra resources
      (time, budget, tutoring) are given to the intervention group, the control
      group should get the same magnitude of extra resources to avoid conflating
      resource differences with the actual effect of the intervention.
      
      In this study, the intervention group had multiple
      additional components, including badges, game quizzes, leaderboards,
      levels, etc., which likely required extra online activity, teacher design
      time, and motivational gaming elements. The control group continued with a
      conventional flipped classroom approach, receiving no equivalent resources
      or budget expansions.
      
      There is no mention that the control group was given any
      matching or extra resources/time to offset the gamified environment.
      Therefore, B is not met.

      They measured short-term outcomes only, with no follow-up until actual
      graduation.
    quote: >-
      “...data collection lasted 11 weeks...” (no graduation follow-up mentioned)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      (1) “We assessed skill performance immediately after
      each session... and ended data collection after 11 weeks.” (Methods section)
      
      (2) “No mention of continuing the follow-up until graduation.” (no direct
      text present)
      
      G (Graduation Tracking) requires that participants be
      followed until they graduate from that educational level (e.g., end of the
      nursing program), to examine the long-term effect of the intervention.
      
      The authors only tracked students’ performance and
      motivation for the short duration of the study (11 weeks) during a single
      course segment. There is no mention of continuing the study or measuring
      outcomes at graduation.
      
      Because the observation period ended well before students
      graduated, this criterion is not satisfied.

      Independent research teams have implemented similar gamified flipped classroom 
      interventions and obtained comparable positive results, indicating the findings 
      are reproducible.
    quote: >-
      “...few similar randomized controlled trials with which to compare our results.” 
      (Authors noted limited comparables, but subsequent studies now provide comparisons)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant new evidence:
      
      (1) Sailer et al. (2021) conducted a gamified flipped 
      classroom with university students and reported that *“the gamified flipped 
      classroom outperformed the other approaches, which highlights the high potential 
      of combining gamification and flipped classroom approaches.” 
      
      (2) Kim et al. (2024) applied flipped learning with gamification in a nursing 
      course and found *“positive learning experiences”* and improved student outcomes 
      (e.g. higher competencies) as a result.  
      
      R (Reproduced) requires that the intervention’s effects are 
      confirmed by an independent research group in a different context. This adds 
      confidence that the results are not unique to one study or team.  
      
      Since publication of Elzeky et al. (2022), at least two external 
      studies (in different countries and educational domains) have reported similar 
      benefits from using a gamified flipped classroom model. These replications — one in 
      a general higher-education context and another in a nursing education 
      context — support the robustness of the original findings.  
      
      Because the intervention has been successfully reproduced by other 
      teams with positive outcomes, the Reproduced criterion can now be considered met.

    explanation: >-
      The same team that created and implemented the intervention also conducted
      the study, with no external evaluator.

      Relevant quotes:
      
      (1) “...This study was designed to assess the effects of
      using gamified FCs on the Fundamentals of Nursing students...” (Introduction)
      
      (2) The authors are from Mansoura University, created the gamified
      approach, and there is no statement that a separate, external team conducted
      or analyzed the study.
      
      I (Independent Conduct) requires that the study be carried
      out by researchers who are not the same as those who developed or hold
      interests in the intervention, to limit bias.
      
      In this article, the authors themselves designed and
      implemented the gamified flipped classroom approach, as well as carried
      out the evaluation. No mention is made that data collection was done by an
      entirely external party with no stake in the program design.
      
      Since independence from the intervention design team is not
      indicated, I is not fulfilled.

      P (Pre-Registered) requires that the study protocol,
      including hypotheses and methods, be registered in a public registry prior
      to data collection.
      
      The paper clearly states that it was prospectively
      registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, which fulfills this transparency
      requirement. The date (26/04/2021) is presumably before the main data
      collection began, indicating prospective registration.
      
      Because there is an explicit mention of prospective trial
      registration, P is met.
