  Background: Flipped learning excessively boosts the conceptual
  understanding of students through the reversed arrangement of
  pre-learning and in classroom learning events and challenges
  students to independently achieve learning objectives.
  Using a gamification method in flipped classrooms can help
  students stay motivated and achieve their goals.
  Methods: This study adopted a randomized controlled study design
  with a pre-test and post-test and involved 128 nursing
  students at Mansoura University. This study randomly
  divided the students into the study and control groups.
  Data were collected at three time points using six tools. In
  the intervention group, Moodle was gamified for 6 weeks.
  Results: A significant difference in the students'
  self-confidence (p=0.021), skills knowledge (p<0.001),
  intensity of preparation (p<0.001), and motivation
  (p<0.001) was observed between the two groups; however,
  no difference in the students' skills performance (p=0.163)
  was observed between the two groups after using gamified
  flipped classrooms. Conclusions: Compared with the
  traditional flipped classrooms, gamified flipped classrooms
  improved nursing students' motivation, intensity of
  preparation, skills knowledge, and self-confidence during
  laboratory clinical practice. Thus, gamification is a
  learning approach that can be implemented in conjunction
  with the flipped classroom model to motivate students to
  participate in the learning process.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study adopted a randomized controlled study design
      with a pre-test and post-test and involved 128 nursing
      students at Mansoura University." (p. 1)

      2) "This study randomly divided the students into the study
      and control groups." (p. 1)

      3) "This study required an a priori sample size of 128
      students, who were randomly divided into two groups (study and
      control) using block randomization with a block size of 4."
      (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires randomization at the class or school
      level to minimize contamination, unless it's a
      personal tutoring intervention. The quotes clearly
      state that individual students were randomly assigned to the
      study or control group. The intervention (gamified
      flipped classroom) was not personal tutoring.
      Therefore, the randomization unit does not meet the criterion.

      Criterion C (Class-level RCT) is not met because randomization
      was performed at the student level.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Assessments used researcher-developed quizzes and checklists,
      not standardized exams.
    quote: >-
      Three formative quizzes for each timepoint were developed by the
      researchers. Each consisted of 20 questions... Eight
      checklists were developed after reviewing the literature,
      nursing textbooks, and logbook of the Faculty of Nursing...

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Tool V: Fundamentals of nursing II knowledge tests Three
      formative quizzes for each timepoint were developed by the
      researchers." (p. 4)

      2) "Each consisted of 20 questions: quiz 1 covered oral
      medication administration and intramuscular injection; quiz 2
      covered range of motion exercises and subcutaneous and
      intradermal injections. However, quiz 3 covered glucocheck
      and heat and cold applications." (p. 4)

      3) "Tool VI: Fundamentals of nursing II skill observation
      checklists Eight checklists were developed after reviewing the
      literature, nursing textbooks, and logbook of the Faculty of
      Nursing, Mansoura University..." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires the use of standardized, widely
      recognized exams, not assessments specially designed for the
      study. The paper explicitly states that the
      knowledge quizzes (Tool V) and skill observation checklists
      (Tool VI) were developed by the researchers.
      There is no mention of using any external, standardized exams
      for nursing skills or knowledge.

      Criterion E (Exam-based Assessment) is not met because the
      assessments were custom-made by the researchers.

      The intervention period was 6 weeks, shorter than a full
      academic term.

      Then, after collecting baseline data, Moodle was gamified over
      the remaining 6 weeks for the students in the intervention
      group...

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In the intervention group, Moodle was gamified for 6
      weeks." (p. 1)

      2) "The assistant staff gathered data for 11 weeks at three
      timepoints in the second academic semester (2020â€“2021)...
      Timepoint 0 (T0) covers the first 2 weeks, and timepoints 1
      (T1) and 2 (T2) cover the subsequent 3 weeks."
      (p. 5)

      3) "Then, after collecting baseline data, Moodle was gamified
      over the remaining 6 weeks for the students in the
      intervention group..." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcomes to be measured at least one full
      academic term (approx. 3-4 months) after the intervention
      begins. The study collected baseline data (T0) over 2
      weeks, then implemented the gamified intervention for the next
      6 weeks (covering T1 and T2, each spanning 3 weeks).
      The total intervention duration was 6 weeks, which is
      shorter than a typical academic term. Data collection spanned
      11 weeks in total, but the core intervention period where
      gamification occurred was only 6 weeks.

      Criterion T (Term Duration) is not met because the
      intervention duration was only 6 weeks.

      students' demographic characteristics (n=64 in each group)" (p. 4)

      2) "No substantial differences in sex, secondary school
      location, economic status, interest in the Fundamentals of
      Nursing course, interest in the nursing profession, degree of
      participation... were observed between the two groups."
      (p. 7)

      3) "However, the control group and students who didn't agree to
      participate in the program did not receive any intervention,
      except for their routine FC education." (p. 5)

      4) "The two groups were taught once a week (120 min) in the
      laboratory skills with the same six instructors and content." (p. 5)

      5) "In the first 2 weeks, both groups received routine FC
      instructions, which included a 2-h skill video and one
      multiple choice quiz related to pre-class materials..."
      (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires clear documentation of the control group's
      characteristics and conditions. Table 1 provides
      demographic data for both groups, showing their baseline
      comparability. The paper states the control group
      received only the routine Flipped Classroom (FC) instruction,
      the same as the intervention group during the baseline phase
      and throughout for the control group. Both groups
      had the same instructors and content.

      Criterion D (Documented Control Group) is met because the
      control group's characteristics and treatment are described.

      3) "This study randomly divided the students into the study

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the school level.
      The paper states randomization occurred at the student level
       within a single faculty (Faculty of Nursing) at
      one university (Mansoura University). This does not meet
      the requirement for school-level randomization.

      Criterion S (School-level RCT) is not met because
      randomization was done at the student level within one
      institution.

      4) "Eight checklists were developed after reviewing the

      Nursing, Mansoura University..." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires the study to be conducted independently
      from the intervention designers. The author
      contributions section indicates the authors were involved in
      conceptualization, design (software, resources), data
      curation, administration, validation, writing, and analysis.
      The researchers developed the assessment tools
      and designed the gamified quizzes. There
      is no mention of an independent third party conducting the
      study or evaluation. Although data collectors were blinded
      , this doesn't equate to independent conduct of the
      overall study design and analysis.

      Criterion I (Independent Conduct) is not met because the same
      team designed, implemented, and analyzed the study.

      2) "Timepoint 0 (T0) covers the first 2 weeks, and timepoints
      1 (T1) and 2 (T2) cover the subsequent 3 weeks." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcomes to be measured at least one full
      academic year (approx. 9-10 months) after the intervention
      begins. The paper states data collection spanned 11
      weeks in total during one semester. This duration is
      significantly shorter than a full academic year.

      Criterion Y (Year Duration) is not met because the study's
      duration was only 11 weeks. (Also, Criterion T was not met).
  b:

    explanation: >-
      The intervention group received gamified activities (extra
      quizzes, points, badges) which constitute additional resources/
      engagement time compared to the control group's routine FC,
      and this difference was not explicitly tested as the treatment
      variable nor balanced.

      4) "Easy game quizzes contain 5 questions; a moderate quiz
      consists of 10 questions in crossword form; and a difficult
      quiz contains 15 questions in millionaire quiz form."
      (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B requires balanced time/budget between groups
      unless the difference is the treatment variable.
      The intervention group received gamified elements (multiple
      extra quizzes per skill, badges, leaderboards, points, levels)
      on top of the routine FC activities. This represents
      additional content and engagement time compared to the control
      group, which only received routine FC. The study
      aimed to assess the effects of *gamified* FC versus routine FC
      , implying the gamification elements themselves were
      the focus. However, the standard requires that if extra
      resources (like additional quiz time/engagement) are provided,
      they must either be explicitly framed as the variable under
      test OR balanced in the control group. The paper
      frames the *gamified FC approach* as the intervention, but
      doesn't explicitly state it's testing the effect of *additional
      engagement time* provided by these gamified elements versus a
      control group with equivalent non-gamified engagement time.
      The control group did not receive any comparable extra
      activities or time. The difference in resources/
      engagement (gamified activities vs. none) was not balanced and
      not explicitly framed as *testing the effect of additional
      resources/time*. Following the pseudocode: EXTRA_RESOURCES_PRESENT
      is true (gamified quizzes/activities take time/effort).
      RESOURCES_ARE_TREATMENT is arguably false (they test 'gamified
      FC' effect, not explicitly 'extra time via gamification'
      effect). CONTROL_MATCHES_RESOURCES is false. WITHIN_SUBJECTS is
      false. Therefore, the criterion is not met.

      Criterion B (Balanced Control Group) is not met because the
      intervention group received additional gamified activities
      (implying extra engagement time/resources) not matched in the
      control group, and this imbalance wasn't explicitly the
      treatment variable being tested.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper does not mention any independent replication of this
      specific study by another research team.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "However, this study has many limitations. First, there are
      few similar randomized controlled trials with which to
      compare our results." (p. 10)

      2) "Most randomized controlled trials were not comparable
      because they either used game-based learning or the control
      group used conventional teaching and not FC learning and the
      subjects were not usually higher education nursing students." (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires the study to be independently replicated
      by a different team in a different context. The
      authors explicitly state there are few similar RCTs to compare
      their results with and that most are not comparable.
      There is no mention within the paper of any external
      team replicating this specific intervention (Gamified FC using
      these specific elements vs routine FC for nursing skills). A
      quick check for external replications would be needed, but based
      solely on the paper, none is reported.      Additionally, a literature search did not find any external replication of this study by independent researchers as of April 2025.

      Criterion R (Reproduced) is not met as there is no evidence
      within the paper of independent replication.

      2) "The primary outcomes were improvement in nursing students'
      motivation, skill knowledge, skill performance and skill
      confidence level." (p. 3)

      3) "The secondary outcome includes improvement in nursing
      students' intensity of preparation." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires measuring impact on all main subjects
      using standardized exams. The study focused
      exclusively on outcomes related to a specific course,
      "Fundamentals of Nursing II," specifically measuring skills
      competency (knowledge, performance, confidence), motivation,
      and preparation intensity. There is no mention of
      assessing performance in other general academic subjects.
      Furthermore, Criterion E (Exam-based Assessment) was not met
      because non-standardized assessments were used.

      Criterion A (All-subject Exams) is not met because only
      nursing-specific outcomes were measured, and standardized exams
      were not used (Criterion E failed).

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation from
      their current educational stage. The study's data
      collection period was explicitly stated as 11 weeks within one
      semester. The authors acknowledge the need to study
      long-term effects, indicating such tracking was not
      part of this study.      No follow-up publication by the authors tracking this cohort to graduation has been found (as of April 2025). Furthermore, Criterion Y (Year Duration) was not met.

      Criterion G (Graduation Tracking) is not met because the
      follow-up period was only 11 weeks.

      timepoints in the second academic semester (2020â€“2021)..." (p. 5) (Assuming the second semester runs roughly
      Feb-June).

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires pre-registration before the study begins
      . The paper explicitly states it was prospectively
      registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on April 26, 2021.
      Data collection occurred during the second academic semester of
      2020-2021. While the exact start date of data
      collection isn't given, the second semester typically starts
      earlier in the year (e.g., January/February). However, the
      term "prospectively registered" implies registration before
      participant enrollment or intervention initiation. Given the
      explicit statement of prospective registration and the date, it
      meets the requirement.      According to the trial registry, the study's start date was April 22, 2021&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, which shows that registration occurred essentially at the study's onset.

      Criterion P (Pre-registered) is met as the study states it was
      prospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.
