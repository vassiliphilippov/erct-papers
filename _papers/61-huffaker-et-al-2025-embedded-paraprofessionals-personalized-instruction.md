  Using embedded paraprofessionals to provide personalized instruction is a
  promising model for differentiating instruction within the classroom. This
  study examines two randomized controlled trials of paraprofessional-led
  tutoring in early-grade math and literacy. However, intent-to-treat (ITT)
  analyses revealed no overall achievement impacts for either program. We then
  explore two mechanisms that have surfaced in the tutoring literature as
  central efficacy moderators—dosage and tailoring—as plausible explanations to
  these results. While dosage was low for both programs, we estimate significant
  benefits from treatment assignment at higher-dosage campuses in numeracy (i.e.,
  up to 0.28 SD at 80% progression) but no effect at any level of observed dosage
  on literacy. Curricular analysis revealed the literacy program's rigid
  structure may have impeded adaptation to student proficiency while student
  skill did not predict differences in numeracy program impacts. Supplemented by
  tutor survey data, these findings suggest that successful implementation of
  para-tutoring may depend on role prioritization, instructional coordination,
  and the use of student data to provide responsive instruction.

      Student-level randomization is acceptable here because the intervention is
      tutoring.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study examines two randomized controlled trials of
      paraprofessional-led tutoring in early-grade math and literacy." (p. 1)

      2) "Within each classroom and baseline reading-level stratum, researchers
      randomly assigned 103 students to treatment and 182 students to the
      control." (p. 7)

      3) "Within each classroom, researchers randomly assigned 384 students to
      the treatment group and 849 students to the control group." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomization at the class level to avoid
      contamination, but the ERCT standard explicitly allows student-level
      randomization when the intervention is personal tutoring.

      This paper evaluates paraprofessional-led tutoring. The randomization
      procedures show eligible students were randomized within classrooms for
      both the literacy and numeracy studies. Because the treatment is tutoring,
      the class-level unit is not required under the tutoring exception.

      Criterion C is met because the intervention is tutoring, so student-level
      randomization within classrooms is allowed under the ERCT exception.

      We preregistered end-of-year test scores as the main outcome for each
      study. For literacy this is a Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy

      Diagnostic (i-Ready) summative score.

      Diagnostic (i-Ready) summative score." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires outcomes to be measured with standardized, widely
      used exam-based assessments rather than researcher-created tests.

      The paper specifies DIBELS-8 for literacy and the i-Ready Math Diagnostic
      for numeracy as the main end-of-year outcomes. Both are established
      standardized assessments used in U.S. schools.

      Criterion E is met because the primary outcomes are standardized
      assessments (DIBELS-8 and i-Ready), not bespoke researcher-made tests.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Due to the pilot nature of this program, implementation did not begin

      Skills (DIBELS-8) summative score, and for numeracy it is an i-Ready Math
      Diagnostic (i-Ready) summative score." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that the primary outcome is measured at least one
      full academic term after the intervention begins (roughly 3-4 months).

      For the literacy program, implementation began in November (three months
      into the school year). The primary outcome is defined as end-of-year test
      scores, which necessarily occur at the end of the academic year. This
      implies a gap of multiple months between start and outcome measurement,
      exceeding one term.

      The numeracy program is described as beginning in fall 2023 with the same
      end-of-year outcome structure, which also implies at least one term of
      tracking from the start of implementation to the primary outcome.

      Criterion T is met because outcomes are end-of-year measures taken many
      months after implementation begins (well beyond a single term).

      1) "Control students continued to receive all supportive services and

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires a clearly described control condition plus sufficient
      baseline documentation (for example demographics and baseline scores) to
      support comparability.

      The paper explicitly defines the control condition as business-as-usual.
      It also provides baseline characteristic tables by treatment assignment
      (Table A2), reporting demographic composition (for example gender and
      race) and other baseline indicators for treatment and control groups.

      Criterion D is met because the control condition is described as
      business-as-usual and the paper reports baseline characteristics for
      treatment and control groups.

      Randomization occurred within classrooms rather than at the school level.
    quote: >-
      The experimental design for both studies stratified randomization within

      2) "Within each classroom, researchers randomly assigned 384 students to
      the treatment group and 849 students to the control group." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level randomization (whole schools assigned to
      treatment or control).

      The paper states that randomization was stratified within classrooms and
      gives examples of within-classroom student assignment. This is not
      school-level randomization.

      Criterion S is not met because assignment to treatment and control
      occurred within classrooms rather than at the school level.
  i:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The paper evaluates externally developed, district-implemented programs
      rather than a researcher-designed intervention.
    quote: >-
      Both interventions directed paraprofessionals' time towards receiving
      training and personalizing instruction to below-grade level students using
      externally-developed, highly structured programs.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Both interventions directed paraprofessionals' time towards receiving
      training and personalizing instruction to below-grade level students using
      externally-developed, highly structured programs." (p. 5)

      2) "The para-tutors received weekly synchronous coaching from the program
      developer, using tutoring session recordings and dashboards to monitor
      student progress." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the evaluation is conducted independently from
      the intervention designers.

      The interventions are described as using externally developed programs,
      and the literacy program includes coaching from a program developer,
      indicating an implementation/design entity that is separate from the
      paper's research description. The paper positions the authors as
      evaluating district-implemented programs rather than as the intervention
      developers.

      The paper does not provide a formal independence statement (for example,
      an explicit declaration of no role in program design), but the described
      separation between district/program developer and the evaluation supports
      treating the evaluation as independent under the ERCT criterion.

      Criterion I is met because the interventions are externally developed and
      the paper presents an evaluation of district-implemented programs rather
      than a designer-led evaluation.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Due to the pilot nature of this program, implementation did not begin
      until November, three months into the school year." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires that outcomes are measured at least one full academic
      year after the intervention begins.

      The literacy program did not begin until November, which the paper
      describes as three months into the school year. This indicates the
      intervention was not implemented for a full academic-year cycle from the
      beginning of the year.

      The numeracy study is also described as a school-year intervention with
      fall start and end-of-year outcomes, but the paper does not document a
      full-year implementation window from the start of the academic year
      through the end.

      Criterion Y is not met because implementation began in November, so the
      study does not document a full academic year of tracking from the start of
      the school year.

      Extra tutoring time is the treatment being tested, so a business-as-usual
      control is acceptable.
    quote: >-

      interventions they usually would during their “business-as-usual” (BaU)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "students were expected to receive 15-minute in-class, one-on-one early
      literacy sessions daily." (p. 5)

      2) "paraprofessional instruction was to occur in 20-minute increments to
      small groups three times a week." (p. 6)

      3) "Control students continued to receive all supportive services and
      interventions they usually would during their “business-as-usual” (BaU)
      course of schooling." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B asks whether the intervention and control conditions are
      balanced in time and resources, unless the additional resources are
      explicitly the treatment variable.

      Both interventions add instructional resources: daily one-on-one tutoring
      in literacy and small-group tutoring sessions in numeracy. The control
      condition is business-as-usual with no matched additional instructional
      time.

      Here, the additional tutoring time and staffing model are the core
      components being evaluated (two para-tutoring programs). Under the ERCT
      exception, when extra instructional time is integral to the treatment
      being tested, a business-as-usual control is acceptable as long as the
      study intent is to test the effects of providing that additional tutoring
      resource.

      Criterion B is met because the added tutoring time is integral to the
      treatment being tested, so a business-as-usual control is acceptable under
      the ERCT rule.

      kindergarten mathematics intervention, ROOTS, delivered within the
      context of a research base core program." (Clarke et al., 2022, PDF p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication of the study's
      intervention and findings in a different context by a different research
      team, ideally in peer-reviewed outlets.

      The numeracy intervention in this paper is described as adapted from an
      established program with prior evaluations in other districts. External
      peer-reviewed studies of the ROOTS kindergarten math intervention exist,
      including an RCT with positive effects and later replication work that
      found null effects in a different context.

      However, those studies evaluate ROOTS as a math intervention, not the
      specific delivery model studied here (embedded paraprofessionals in a
      large urban district with implementation changes such as reduced
      coaching), and they do not replicate the combined two-intervention
      (literacy plus numeracy) design of this paper. The literacy program is
      explicitly described as a first-ever implementation, and no independent
      replication of this paper's results was located.

      Criterion R is not met because no independent study was found that
      replicates this paper's para-tutoring implementations and findings.

      Diagnostic (i-Ready) summative score." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires assessing outcomes across all main core subjects
      using standardized exams (and it cannot be met if criterion E is not met).

      The paper defines the preregistered primary outcomes as a literacy
      assessment (DIBELS-8) and a math assessment (i-Ready). It does not
      describe standardized end-of-year outcomes in other core subjects (for
      example science or social studies), nor does it report cross-subject
      spillovers for each cohort.

      Criterion A is not met because the study reports only literacy and math
      outcomes rather than standardized exams across all main subjects.

      Diagnostic (i-Ready) summative score." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation from the
      relevant educational stage. Under the ERCT rules, if criterion Y (Year
      Duration) is not met, criterion G cannot be met either.

      The paper defines its primary outcomes as end-of-year test scores and does
      not describe any multi-year follow-up through later grade completion or
      graduation. Given that the intervention does not meet the ERCT Year
      Duration requirement, graduation tracking is automatically not satisfied
      for this study.

      A web search for follow-up publications by the same authors reporting
      longer-run tracking for these cohorts did not identify any graduation-
      tracking results associated with this study.

      Criterion G is not met because the study measures only end-of-year
      outcomes and does not track students through graduation (and Y is not
      met).

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires a publicly verifiable pre-registered protocol with
      an identifier/link and a registration date that precedes data collection.

      The paper states that outcomes were preregistered but does not provide a
      registry name, URL, registration identifier, or registration date.

      A targeted web search did not locate a public preregistration entry for
      this study that can be verified against the study timeline (for example
      on AEA RCT Registry or OSF Registries). Without a verifiable record and
      timing, the criterion cannot be marked as met.

      Criterion P is not met because no verifiable preregistration record
      (link, ID, and date prior to study start) is provided or could be
      confirmed.
