abstract: >-
  Traditional teaching (TT) is lecturer-centred, while
  student-centred teaching, including Jigsaw (JS), fosters
  student interaction. However, the results of research on the
  effectiveness of JS on learning outcomes is inconsistent.
  This randomised controlled trial compared the effect of JS
  and TT on higher-education students’ knowledge of the anatomy
  and physiology of the sensory apparatus and on their
  perceptions of the two teaching methods.

  Forty-eight undergraduate social nursing students were
  randomised to either a TT or JS-based learning activity. One
  JS student dropped out before completing the activity and was
  excluded, resulting in 47 participants (23 TT, 24 JS).
  Improvement in knowledge was assessed by recording the number
  of correct answers (points) on a 25-question multiple-choice
  test at three time points: before the activity (baseline),
  immediately after the activity (post-intervention) and at a
  three-month follow-up. Additionally, the students’
  perceptions were surveyed post-intervention using a
  questionnaire. Improvement in knowledge was analysed using a
  longitudinal model, and group differences in perceptions were
  analysed using Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests.

  Both groups significantly improved knowledge from baseline to
  post-intervention (TT: 5.2 points; JS: 4.6 points; p < 0.001
  both groups) and from baseline to the three-month follow-up
  (TT: 3.8 points; JS: 3.3 points; p < 0.001 for both groups).
  No statistically significant differences in knowledge were
  observed between the groups (post-intervention difference:
  −0.5 points, 95% CI: −2.3 to 1.2, p = 0.54; three-month
  difference: −0.6 points, 95% CI: −2.4 to 1.2, p = 0.52).
  Overall, 91% improved from baseline to post-intervention, and
  83% from baseline to three months. A higher proportion of TT
  students than JS students preferred their assigned teaching
  activity over others (78% vs. 38%, p = 0.002) or believed it
  would improve their grades (87% vs. 42%, p = 0.004). On the
  other hand, a lower proportion thought that it provided
  useful practice in oral presentation / communication (61% vs.
  88%, p = 0.02).

    explanation: >
      Randomisation was conducted at the individual student
      level (not by intact classes or schools) and no tutoring
      exception applies.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To answer these research questions, we conducted a
      randomised controlled trial. Students were randomly
      allocated to either teaching using JS or TT." (p. 3)

      2) "Following the pre-test, participants were randomly
      assigned into two groups using Microsoft Excel for
      Microsoft 365. The randomisation procedure was carried
      out on site by one of the authors." (p. 4)

      3) "Participants were assigned a random number using the
      = RAND( ) function, and the participant list was
      subsequently sorted from lowest to highest based on this
      random number." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion C requires random assignment at the class
      level (or stronger), to reduce contamination from mixing
      treatment and control students within the same classroom
      context; student-level randomisation is only acceptable
      under the tutoring / personal-teaching exception.

      The paper clearly reports that "participants" / "students"
      were randomly assigned to the two groups using Excel on
      site, which indicates individual-level allocation rather
      than randomising intact classes. The intervention is a
      group-based teaching session (traditional lecture vs.
      Jigsaw), not a one-to-one tutoring program, so the
      criterion's exception does not apply.

      Criterion C is not met because allocation was at the
      individual student level rather than by class (or school).

      Learning was measured with a curriculum-based multiple-
      choice test developed by the authors, not a widely
      recognised standardized exam.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A curriculum-based MCT was systematically developed
      by two of the authors in line with Kanzow et al. [22],
      Krathwohl [23] and Considine et al. [24]." (p. 3)

      2) "The test consisted of 25 questions of medium
      difficulty, organised into five categories reflecting the
      curriculum sub-topics." (p. 3)

      3) "To ensure face and content validity as described by
      Brenner et al. [25], the MCT was reviewed and evaluated
      independently by five anatomy and physiology lecturers at
      the Western Norway University of applied sciences." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion E requires use of standardized exam-based
      assessments that are widely recognised (e.g., national /
      state exams or established standardized tests), rather
      than researcher-created instruments aligned to the
      intervention content.

      Here, the outcome measure is explicitly a "curriculum-
      based" multiple-choice test "developed by two of the
      authors." While the authors describe content review and
      face/content validity checks by lecturers, these steps do
      not transform the instrument into an external, widely
      recognized standardized exam.

      Criterion E is not met because the assessment was
      developed for this study rather than being a standardized
      external exam.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Outcomes were measured again at a three-month follow-up,
      which is approximately one academic term after the
      intervention began.
    quote: >-

      1) "We assessed the students’ knowledge immediately
      before and after the teaching intervention and at a
      three-month follow-up." (p. 3)

      2) "Three months later, the same MCT was repeated during
      a compulsory lecture at campus, within the normal
      teaching hours." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion T requires that educational outcomes be
      measured at least one academic term after the
      intervention begins (commonly about 3–4 months). The
      paper states the intervention occurred on the day of the
      teaching activity (with immediate post-testing), and the
      follow-up measurement occurred "Three months later."

      A three-month follow-up is consistent with an
      approximately term-length interval from intervention
      start to the longer-term measurement, satisfying the
      minimum term-duration follow-up requirement.

      Criterion T is met because the study includes a follow-up
      assessment three months after the intervention started.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The paper clearly defines the comparison groups (TT vs.
      JS), reports group sizes, and reports baseline and follow-
      up outcome data by group.
    quote: >-
      "After excluding the student who dropped out before
      completing the learning activity, a total of 47

      were randomised to either a TT or JS-based learning
      activity. One JS student dropped out before completing
      the activity and was excluded, resulting in 47

      3) "Table 2 Mean scores* for each teaching method at the
      three time points, and comparison of mean score between
      the two teaching methods (n = 47 students** and 135
      scores)" (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion D requires that the control condition be
      well-documented, including who is in it, what they
      received, and baseline/outcome information enabling
      comparison.

      The study clearly identifies the two conditions (TT and
      JS), provides the final analysed sample sizes for each,
      and reports outcome data (including baseline and later
      timepoints) by group in a dedicated table summarising
      mean scores across timepoints. This provides sufficient
      documentation to understand the control group (TT) and
      compare it with the intervention group (JS).

      Criterion D is met because the control group is clearly
      described with group size and outcome data over time.
  s:

      The randomisation occurred among individual students, not
      among schools (or equivalent institutions/sites).

      nursing at the University of Western Norway were invited
      to participate in the study." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion S requires school-level (or equivalent
      institution/site-level) randomisation, such as randomly
      assigning schools or campuses to intervention vs control.

      The paper describes a single-institution study at the
      University of Western Norway with individual participants
      randomised into TT vs JS. There is no indication that
      multiple schools/sites were randomised.

      Criterion S is not met because randomisation was not at
      the school (or site) level.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The authors developed key study materials and conducted
      the randomisation on site, with no quoted evidence of an
      independent external evaluation team.

      3) "The test administration was overseen by one of the
      authors and standardised across the full-time and part
      time tracks." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion I requires that the conduct of the study
      (implementation and/or evaluation) be independent from
      the intervention designers to reduce bias, typically via
      an external/third-party evaluation team.

      The paper explicitly states that two authors developed
      the primary knowledge test, that an author conducted the
      randomisation on site, and that an author oversaw test
      administration at follow-up. While some lecturers
      reviewed materials for validity, this is not the same as
      independent trial conduct or independent evaluation.

      Criterion I is not met because the study was conducted
      and evaluated by the author team without clear external
      independent oversight.
  y:

    explanation: >
      The study’s follow-up lasted three months, which is far

      a compulsory lecture at campus, within the normal
      teaching hours." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion Y requires outcomes to be measured at
      least 75% of an academic year after the intervention
      begins. The longest stated follow-up in this study is
      "three months later," which corresponds to roughly one
      academic term, not most of a year.

      Criterion Y is not met because the tracking duration is
      three months rather than approximately a full academic
      year.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The JS condition received substantially more total time
      and broader learning resources than TT, and this resource
      difference was not framed as the treatment variable nor
      matched in the control condition.
    quote: >-
      "Limitations include ... the JS group was allocated more
      total time (165 min) for the teaching procedure than the
      TT group (105 min), possibly influencing the
      comparability of the two approaches." (p. 11)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The lecture lasted for 105 min, including a
      15-minute break between two 45-minute sessions
      (Table 1)." (p. 6)

      2) "The students had unrestricted access to learning
      resources in both digital and print formats, including
      the course textbook and printed materials, a
      subscription-based online anatomy learning platform and
      all other publicly accessible online content." (p. 6)

      3) "Limitations include ... the JS group was allocated
      more total time (165 min) for the teaching procedure
      than the TT group (105 min), possibly influencing the
      comparability of the two approaches." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion B requires balancing time and resources
      between intervention and control unless (a) differences
      are negligible, (b) the extra resources are explicitly
      the treatment variable being tested, or (c) the control
      is otherwise matched with comparable educational inputs.

      Here, the paper explicitly acknowledges a non-negligible
      time imbalance: 165 minutes allocated for JS procedures
      versus 105 minutes for TT. In addition, the JS group is
      described as having "unrestricted access" to extensive
      digital and print resources, including a subscription-
      based online learning platform; the TT description does
      not indicate an equivalent resource provision.

      Importantly, the study’s stated comparison is between
      teaching methods (JS vs TT), not an explicit test of
      "more time/resources" as the intended treatment
      variable. The authors treat the time difference as a
      limitation affecting comparability, which supports the
      interpretation that the added time is a confound rather
      than the target of evaluation. The control condition is
      not described as receiving matched time or alternative
      activities of equivalent duration/resource intensity.

      Criterion B is not met because the intervention group
      received additional time/resources without a matched
      control and without framing extra resources as the
      treatment variable.

      (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion R requires independent replication of the
      same study (or a clearly equivalent replication) by a
      different research team in a different context, published
      in a peer-reviewed journal.

      The paper does not report that it is itself a replication
      of a prior identical RCT, nor does it cite an external
      study that independently replicated this specific trial’s
      design and findings. Given the paper’s very recent 2026
      publication, no independent replication of this specific
      RCT could be identified during this ERCT check.

      Criterion R is not met because there is no quoted or
      otherwise identifiable evidence of an independent
      replication of this specific RCT.
  a:

    explanation: >
      Criterion E is not met (the outcome test is not a

      Krathwohl [23] and Considine et al. [24]." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion A requires standardized exam-based
      assessment across all main subjects, and it explicitly
      depends on Criterion E being satisfied (standardized
      exams).

      This study uses a researcher-developed curriculum-based
      multiple-choice test focused on a specific anatomy and
      physiology topic, rather than standardized all-subject
      exams. Since Criterion E is not met, Criterion A is not
      met by definition.

      Criterion A is not met because the study does not use
      standardized exam-based assessments (Criterion E fails).
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study only follows students for three months and does
      not track outcomes through graduation; additionally,
      Criterion Y is not met, so G cannot be met.

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion G requires tracking participants until
      graduation at the relevant educational stage. This study
      includes only an immediate post-test and a three-month
      follow-up, with no indication of longer tracking.

      Additionally, ERCT rules specify that if Criterion Y
      (Year Duration) is not met, Criterion G cannot be met.
      Since the study lasts only three months (and Y is not
      met), G necessarily fails as well.

      Criterion G is not met because the study does not track
      students through graduation and has only a three-month
      follow-up.
  p:

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion P requires a publicly accessible
      pre-registered protocol (with registry/link and evidence
      that registration occurred before data collection).

      The paper explicitly states that trial registration is
      "not applicable" and provides no registration platform,
      identifier, or date. This indicates there was no
      pre-registration consistent with the ERCT requirement.

      Criterion P is not met because no pre-registered protocol
      is provided and trial registration is stated as not
      applicable.
