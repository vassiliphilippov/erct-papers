abstract: >-
  The goal of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of Foundations
  for Literacy for deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) children. Forty-eight
  teachers in 14 states were randomly assigned to intervention or control
  groups. Teachers in the intervention group used Foundations one hour a day
  throughout the school year. Teachers in the control group taught their
  typical curricula. DHH children in the intervention group showed
  significantly stronger gains on tests of spoken phonological awareness,
  alphabetic knowledge, and word reading than children in the control group.
  Effect sizes were moderate to large. Children in both groups showed
  equivalent accelerated gains in vocabulary compared to hearing norms.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The unit of randomization was the classroom (teacher), meeting the
      class-level RCT requirement.
    quote: >-
      "The study is a cluster-level randomized controlled trial with classrooms
      randomly assigned to intervention or control blocked within the two
      classroom modes of communication (spoken only or bimodal)." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study is a cluster-level randomized controlled trial with
      classrooms randomly assigned to intervention or control blocked within the
      two classroom modes of communication (spoken only or bimodal)." (p. 7)

      2) "Forty-eight teachers in 14 states were randomly assigned to
      intervention or control groups." (p. 2)

      3) "Randomization was conducted by this independent researcher in SAS 9.4
      using the rannor function, followed by PROC RANK on the random numbers,
      and then dividing into treatment versus control using the mod(y,2)
      function to achieve an even split." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires random assignment at the class level (or stronger) to
      reduce contamination that can occur with within-class student-level
      assignment. The paper explicitly describes the design as a cluster-level
      RCT, with classrooms (teachers) as the randomized unit, and it also
      describes the randomization procedure in detail.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met because randomization was
      implemented at the classroom level with a clearly described procedure.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The primary outcomes were measured using established, standardized
      assessments (for example PAT-2, Woodcock-Johnson III, and PPVT-IV).
    quote: >-
      "We assessed receptive vocabulary with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary
      Test-IV (Receptive Vocab; Dunn & Dunn, 2007)." (p. 9)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Children were assessed with four subtests of the Phonological
      Awareness Test-2 (PAT-2; Robertson & Salter, 2007)..." (p. 9)

      2) "Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement-III- Letter-Word Identification
      (Letter-Word ID, Woodcock et al., 2007)..." (p. 9)

      3) "We assessed receptive vocabulary with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary
      Test-IV (Receptive Vocab; Dunn & Dunn, 2007)." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized, widely recognized assessments rather
      than researcher-created tests aligned to the intervention. The paper
      reports multiple established standardized instruments, including PAT-2,
      Woodcock-Johnson III subtests, and PPVT-IV.

      The paper also includes a curriculum-based "Keyword Decoding Test", but
      the presence of that additional measure does not negate that the study
      used standardized exams for key literacy outcomes.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is met because key outcomes were
      assessed with widely used standardized tests (PAT-2, WJ-III, PPVT-IV).
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured across the school year, exceeding a single academic
      term.
    quote: >-
      "Teachers in the intervention group used Foundations one hour a day
      throughout the school year." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Teachers in the intervention group used Foundations one hour a day
      throughout the school year." (p. 2)

      2) "Examiners administered a battery of language and literacy assessments
      at the beginning and end of the school year." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcome measurement at least one academic term after
      the intervention begins. The intervention ran throughout the school year,
      and assessment occurred at the beginning and end of that year, which is
      longer than a term.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met because the study tracked
      outcomes from the start to the end of the school year.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control condition and baseline characteristics are documented, with
      both demographics (Table 1) and descriptions of control instruction.
    quote: >-
      "Table 1 provides the demographic and background characteristics of the
      sample participants by group based on teacher report." (p. 8)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Control teachers continued their usual teaching practices during the
      intervention year and received Foundations training and curriculum in the
      summer after the study was completed." (p. 7)

      2) "Table 1 provides the demographic and background characteristics of the
      sample participants by group based on teacher report." (p. 8)

      3) "Group comparisons showed that intervention and control groups did not
      differ significantly in terms of gender, age, ethnicity, home language,
      FRL, or additional disabilities." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires a well-documented control group: who they are, how
      comparable they are at baseline, and what they received. The paper
      documents the control condition as usual teaching practices (with delayed
      training after the study), provides a demographic table, and reports that
      groups did not differ significantly on key baseline characteristics.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because the paper provides
      both baseline comparability information and a clear description of the
      control condition.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization was at the classroom (teacher) level rather than at the
      school level.
    quote: >-
      "The study is a cluster-level randomized controlled trial with classrooms
      randomly assigned to intervention or control..." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study is a cluster-level randomized controlled trial with
      classrooms randomly assigned to intervention or control blocked within the
      two classroom modes of communication (spoken only or bimodal)." (p. 7)

      2) "There were 48 teacher participants from 39 schools located in 14
      states..." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level randomization (schools assigned to
      conditions). The study explicitly states that classrooms (teachers) were
      randomized. The sample includes 48 teachers from 39 schools, which is
      consistent with a design where multiple classes (and potentially multiple
      teachers within a school) could be the unit of assignment.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is not met because assignment was
      at the classroom/teacher level, not the school level.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention was developed and evaluated by the same research team,
      so the evaluation was not independent of the intervention designers.
    quote: >-
      "It was developed by researchers and teachers over a 10-year period..."
      (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "It was developed by researchers and teachers over a 10-year period
      using an iterative design process..." (p. 5)

      2) "The first and second authors contacted administrators at the state,
      city, and school level throughout the US." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the study be conducted independently from the
      intervention designers to reduce bias. The paper describes Foundations as
      developed through a multi-year process by researchers and teachers, and
      the authors themselves led recruitment. There is no statement that an
      external evaluation team independent of the intervention designers ran the
      study end-to-end.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is not met because the paper does
      not demonstrate independent (third-party) conduct separate from the
      intervention development team.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention and measurement spanned the full academic school year.
    quote: >-
      "Examiners administered a battery of language and literacy assessments at
      the beginning and end of the school year." (p. 8)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Teachers in the intervention group used Foundations one hour a day
      throughout the school year." (p. 2)

      2) "Examiners administered a battery of language and literacy assessments
      at the beginning and end of the school year." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires measurement at least one full academic year after the
      intervention begins. The paper states the intervention occurred
      throughout the school year and that assessments were administered at the
      beginning and end of that school year.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is met because the study covered
      and measured outcomes across a full school year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The treatment replaced part of the normal literacy block rather than
      adding extra student instruction time, and the study evaluates the full
      implementation package (curriculum plus required teacher training and
      coaching) against business-as-usual.
    quote: >-
      "Teachers in the intervention group used Foundations one hour a day
      throughout the school year. Teachers in the control group taught their
      typical curricula." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Teachers in the intervention group used Foundations one hour a day
      throughout the school year. Teachers in the control group taught their
      typical curricula." (p. 2)

      2) "Teachers in the intervention group attended a two-day professional
      development workshop during the summer." (p. 11)

      3) "To provide ongoing coaching, a research team member sent written
      feedback to the teachers within two weeks that a unit was recorded."
      (p. 11)

      4) "Control teachers continued their usual teaching practices during the
      intervention year and received Foundations training and curriculum in the
      summer after the study was completed." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B asks whether additional resources (time, budget, materials)
      are balanced across conditions, unless those resources are integral to the
      treatment being tested. Here, the student-facing instructional time is a
      one-hour literacy block, and the control group taught their typical
      curricula, suggesting the intervention is a curriculum replacement rather
      than added student time.

      The intervention package also includes additional teacher resources
      (two-day workshop and coaching feedback). These supports appear to be
      integral to implementing Foundations as tested in this RCT (the study
      evaluates Foundations under a feasible support model). The control group
      is business-as-usual by design (with delayed training after the study).

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met because the intervention
      primarily replaces existing instructional time, and added implementation
      supports are integral to the treatment package being evaluated.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication by a different research team was identified.
    quote: >-
      "It is the only randomized controlled trial of a comprehensive early
      literacy intervention specifically developed for DHH children..." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "It is the only randomized controlled trial of a comprehensive early
      literacy intervention specifically developed for DHH children..." (p. 2)

      2) "This study, together with previous peer-reviewed publications,
      supports the conclusion that Foundations is an effective intervention for
      young DHH children." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication (different authors and
      team) in a peer-reviewed outlet. The paper itself states this is the only
      RCT of this comprehensive intervention for this population. The paper also
      cites earlier Foundations studies, but these are part of the same overall
      program of research rather than an independent replication.

      A web search for replication studies of this specific RCT and intervention
      (using the title, intervention name, and DOI) did not identify a peer-
      reviewed, independent replication by other authors as of the ERCT check
      date.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is not met because no independent
      replication was found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were limited to language and literacy, with no standardized
      measures reported for other core subjects.
    quote: >-
      "Examiners administered a battery of language and literacy assessments at
      the beginning and end of the school year." (p. 8)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Examiners administered a battery of language and literacy assessments
      at the beginning and end of the school year." (p. 8)

      2) "Assessors administered the following six assessments:" (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized assessments across all main subjects,
      not only the target domain, to detect possible trade-offs. This study
      reports a battery of language and literacy assessments and lists literacy-
      related measures (phonological awareness, alphabetic knowledge/decoding,
      and vocabulary). The paper does not report standardized assessments in
      other core subject areas (for example math or science).

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because the study
      measured only language and literacy outcomes rather than all main subjects.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study did not track participants through graduation or an equivalent
      endpoint.
    quote: >-
      "We did not investigate the long-term outcomes of Foundations." (p. 18)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We did not investigate the long-term outcomes of Foundations." (p. 18)

      2) "Examiners administered a battery of language and literacy assessments
      at the beginning and end of the school year." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires follow-up tracking through graduation (an appropriate
      graduation endpoint for the educational stage). The paper explicitly
      states that it did not investigate long-term outcomes and that assessment
      occurred at the beginning and end of the school year.

      A search for follow-up publications by the same author team reporting
      long-term tracking of this RCT cohort (for example into later grades) did
      not identify a paper that tracks this randomized cohort to graduation as
      of the ERCT check date.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is not met because outcomes were
      not tracked beyond the school year and no graduation-tracking follow-up
      report was found.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper does not report a pre-registration record or registry identifier
      for the trial.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Study procedures that included teacher consent and parent notification
      were approved by the Georgia State University Institutional Review Board
      as well as those of participating school districts." (p. 8)

      2) "This research was supported by the US Department of Education,
      Institute of Education Sciences through Award #R324C120001." (p. 19)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the full study protocol be pre-registered before
      data collection begins, with a verifiable registry record and timing.
      The paper provides IRB approval and funding information but does not
      provide a pre-registration statement, registry name, URL, or registration
      identifier.

      Attempts to verify a registry record via common education trial registries
      did not produce a specific, citable pre-registration entry for this study
      based on the information reported in the paper.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is not met because the paper does
      not provide a pre-registration record and none could be verified.
