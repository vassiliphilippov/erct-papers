abstract: >-
  NORC at the University of Chicago designed and implemented an impact evaluation
  of the SEEDS of Learning (SEEDS) professional development (PD) program on
  behalf of the Kenneth Rainin Foundation, in collaboration with Kidango. SEEDS
  of Learning is an evidence-based PD program that prepares early childhood
  educators to help children develop the social-emotional, language, and emergent
  literacy skills they need to be kindergarten-ready. The purpose of the study
  was to evaluate the impact of the SEEDS PD program on students' oral language,
  literacy, and social-emotional outcomes. Using a clustered randomized controlled
  trial design, the study found positive impacts on early literacy skills, with
  the largest impacts in Year 2 of implementation, after the program experienced
  learning over time to better implement the SEEDS program.

    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Centers (preschool sites) were randomly assigned, which is class-level or
      stronger randomization.
    quote: >-
      "Centers were randomly assigned to receive the program or serve as a
      comparison control group." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The remaining two-thirds included 26 preschool centers with 459 students
      - aged four or five years." (p. 5)

      2) "Centers were randomly assigned to receive the program or serve as a
      comparison control group." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomization at the class level or stronger to avoid
      within-class contamination. Here, assignment occurs at the "preschool
      center" level, which is stronger than class-level assignment and therefore
      satisfies the requirement.

      Criterion C is met because entire centers (an institution-level unit) were
      randomly assigned to treatment versus control.    
  e:
    met: true

      The outcomes use established, widely used assessments (IGDI, FastBridge,
      HTKS) rather than a custom test created for this study.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To assess student language, emergent literacy, and executive function
      outcomes, we used three measures:" (p. 5)

      2) "Individual Growth and Developmental Indicators (IGDI Version 1.0) which
      assesses children in fall and spring (with a winter option) in skills that
      predict future reading proficiency." (p. 5)

      3) "FastBridge Learning: a valid, reliable measure of young children’s
      letter name and letter sound fluency (http://www.fastbridge.org/)" (p. 6)

      4) "Head, Toes, Knees, and Shoulders assessment (HTKS): a task-based
      assessment that assesses inhibitory control, working memory, and attention
      focusing (Cameron Ponitz, McClelland, Matthews, & Morrison, 2008)." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized, widely recognized assessments rather
      than a bespoke measure aligned to the intervention. The paper names three
      established measurement systems: IGDI, FastBridge Learning, and HTKS. The
      text also explicitly characterizes FastBridge as "valid, reliable" and
      positions IGDI as used "at scale," which is consistent with standardized
      use rather than a study-specific test.

      Criterion E is met because the study relies on established assessment
      instruments (IGDI, FastBridge, HTKS) rather than a custom-made exam.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes are measured from fall to spring within a school year, which is at
      least one academic term (and in practice close to a full year).
    quote: >-
      "This assessment is typically conducted 1:1 between teacher and student.
      In the context of the RCT, external assessors conducted the assessments for
      the fall and spring assessment periods." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Half the eligible centers were randomly assigned to receive SEEDS during
      the 2017-2018 school year (SEEDS Implementation Year 1, N=13), and the other
      half served as comparison controls (N=13)." (p. 5)

      2) "Individual Growth and Developmental Indicators (IGDI Version 1.0) which
      assesses children in fall and spring (with a winter option) in skills that
      predict future reading proficiency." (p. 5)

      3) "In the context of the RCT, external assessors conducted the assessments
      for the fall and spring assessment periods." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires at least one term between intervention start and the
      primary outcome measurement. The intervention is described as occurring
      during the "2017-2018 school year," and student measurement occurs in "fall
      and spring," which necessarily spans more than a single term.

      Criterion T is met because the study measures outcomes across fall-to-spring
      within a school year, exceeding the one-term minimum.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The paper clearly defines a comparison control group (including sample
      sizes) and reports balance checks and baseline equivalence statements.
    quote: >-
      "Half the eligible centers were randomly assigned to receive SEEDS during
      the 2017-2018 school year (SEEDS Implementation Year 1, N=13), and the other
      half served as comparison controls (N=13)." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Centers were randomly assigned to receive the program or serve as a
      comparison control group." (p. 5)

      2) "Half the eligible centers were randomly assigned to receive SEEDS during
      the 2017-2018 school year (SEEDS Implementation Year 1, N=13), and the other
      half served as comparison controls (N=13)." (p. 5)

      3) "Balance analyses found no statistically significant differences between
      the two experimental conditions in SEEDS Implementation Year 2 of the study
      there were sample differences in student race and ethnicity when compared
      to SEEDS Implementation Year 1." (p. 5)

      4) "Centers were randomized to treatment and control conditions, with all
      teachers within a center assigned to the center condition. Groups were
      equivalent at baseline and statistical adjustments were made to account for
      differential attrition from the study in year 2 based on student race and
      ethnicity (See Appendix A)." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control condition be clearly described and
      sufficiently documented to support interpretation. The paper explicitly
      defines a "comparison control group," provides the number of centers in
      each arm (N=13 / N=13), and reports that balance analyses were conducted.
      It also states that groups were "equivalent at baseline" and describes
      adjustment for differential attrition, indicating that baseline and group
      comparability were assessed and addressed.

      A limitation is that the paper’s sample characteristics table is organized
      by implementation year rather than by treatment vs. control. However, the
      control group identity, size, assignment mechanism, and baseline
      equivalence statements are explicit and usable for evaluation.

      Criterion D is met because the control group is clearly defined (who, how
      assigned, and N) and baseline equivalence/balance work is documented.

      Randomization occurred at the preschool center level, which meets the
      school-level RCT requirement in this context.

      2) "Centers were randomly assigned to receive the program or serve as a
      comparison control group." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the level of the educational
      institution implementing the intervention. In early childhood settings,
      "preschool centers" function as the institutional unit analogous to a
      school site. Randomizing 26 centers into treatment and control satisfies
      school-level assignment.

      Criterion S is met because whole preschool centers were randomized.

      The evaluation is conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago, while the
      program is implemented in collaboration with Kidango as the implementation
      partner.

      2) "Kidango, a leading early learning organization, was the primary research
      partner." (p. 4)

      3) "The study tested the impact of a new SEEDS Program implemented by
      Kidango (the implementation partner) ..." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I is about separation between the evaluator/research team and the
      intervention implementer/designer to reduce bias. The paper describes NORC
      (University of Chicago) as the group that "designed and implemented" the
      impact evaluation. It also explicitly labels Kidango as the "implementation
      partner" for the SEEDS program. This indicates a structural separation
      between evaluation and implementation roles.

      Criterion I is met because the evaluation is led by NORC, while Kidango is
      identified as the implementation partner for the intervention.

      2) "Individual Growth and Developmental Indicators (IGDI Version 1.0) which
      assesses children in fall and spring (with a winter option) in skills that
      predict future reading proficiency." (p. 5)

      3) "In the context of the RCT, external assessors conducted the assessments
      for the fall and spring assessment periods." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least one academic year after
      the intervention begins (or at minimum spanning the full academic cycle).
      The intervention is situated in the "2017-2018 school year," and outcomes
      are collected in fall and spring within that year. This aligns with a
      full-year academic cycle in typical US preschool calendars.

      Criterion Y is met because measurement spans fall-to-spring within the
      2017-2018 school year, representing a full academic cycle.

      Any additional resources (PD and coaching) are the intervention being
      tested, and the comparison group is business-as-usual with delayed treatment.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "It provides preschool teachers with content knowledge and pedagogical
      training via PD and coaching." (p. 2)

      2) "Centers were randomly assigned to receive the program or serve as a
      comparison control group." (p. 5)

      3) "The intervention had a staggered adoption such that the teachers in the
      control centers of the 2017-2018 school year (SEEDS Implementation Year 1)
      would receive SEEDS in the 2018-2019 school year (SEEDS Implementation Year
      2)." (p. 5)

      4) "In the present study, we evaluated the impacts of SEEDS on students
      through a cluster randomized controlled trial design with a delayed
      treatment for teachers in the control group." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B asks whether differences in time/budget/resources are balanced
      across conditions, unless the additional resource is explicitly the
      treatment variable being tested. Here, the intervention is professional
      development and coaching for teachers. That is inherently an "extra
      resource" relative to business-as-usual, but it is also the core treatment
      whose impact the study is designed to estimate. The paper also describes a
      delayed-treatment design, where control teachers receive SEEDS later, which
      is consistent with business-as-usual during the control period.

      Under the ERCT decision tree, this falls under the case where additional
      resources are integral to the intervention being tested; therefore a
      business-as-usual control without those resources is acceptable by design.

      Criterion B is met because the additional resources (PD/coaching) are the
      treatment variable, with a delayed-treatment control design.
  r:

      No peer-reviewed, independent replication of this specific SEEDS PD RCT was
      found in the available literature.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "While earlier studies reflected the promise of the SEEDS program, the
      present study rigorously tested the causal impact of SEEDS on student
      learning." (p. 10)

      2) "However, because SEEDS was confounded with other Reading Corps program
      features, it was impossible to isolate the effects of SEEDS." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication by a different research
      team in a different context, ideally published in a peer-reviewed journal.
      The paper frames itself as an effort to isolate SEEDS effects that were
      previously confounded in other program contexts. After searching broadly
      for replication studies of this specific SEEDS PD RCT, no qualifying
      independent replication publication was identified.

      Criterion R is not met because no independent, peer-reviewed replication of
      this specific RCT was found.

      The study focuses on language/literacy and executive function outcomes and
      does not assess all core subjects (for example, mathematics).

      2) "Student outcome measures included scales from two assessments: the
      Individual Growth and Development Indicators (IGDI) ... and the FastBridge
      assessment ..." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires exam-based assessment across all main subjects taught
      at that educational level to detect spillovers or tradeoffs. The listed
      outcomes are literacy/language measures (IGDI and FastBridge components)
      plus executive function (HTKS). There is no math achievement assessment or
      other core-subject coverage described in the outcome measures.

      Criterion A is not met because outcomes do not cover all core subjects and
      omit mathematics assessment.

      4) "Interviews were conducted in Study Year 3 among both original treatment
      and control group teachers ..." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation from the
      relevant educational stage. The paper documents outcome measurement within
      fall-to-spring assessment windows during implementation years and adds
      qualitative interviews in a later year. It does not describe following the
      student cohort to a graduation milestone (for example, kindergarten entry)
      and does not report later-stage outcomes.

      Additional searching for follow-up publications by the same authors that
      track the same cohort to graduation did not yield a qualifying paper with
      graduation-tracking results.

      Criterion G is not met because there is no evidence of student tracking to
      graduation from the educational stage.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires a publicly accessible pre-registered protocol with a
      registration date before data collection begins. The paper does not provide
      a registry name, link, identifier, or registration timing statement. A
      targeted search for a corresponding registration entry did not identify a
      verified pre-registration record for this study.

      Criterion P is not met because the study protocol is not shown to be
      pre-registered.
