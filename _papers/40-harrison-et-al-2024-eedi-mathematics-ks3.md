abstract: >-
  This report evaluates the impact of Eedi, a digital mathematics
  platform, on raising maths attainment amongst Key Stage 3 students
  (Year 7). The study used a randomised controlled trial design with 20
  schools, where schools were randomly assigned to either the
  intervention (Eedi) or control (business as usual) condition. The
  intervention ran from Autumn 2023 to June 2024. The primary outcome
  was attainment on the NWEA MAP Growth Standardised Assessment. Results
  showed that students using Eedi scored significantly higher than the
  control group, with an effect size of 0.17.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study was designed as a randomised controlled trial with whole
      schools (Year 7) assigned at random to either intervention (exposure to
      Eedi) or control conditions (non-exposure to Eedi) on a 1:1 basis."
      (p. 19)

      2) "Randomisation was carried out by the WhatWorked team who were
      ‘blind’ as to the identity of schools." (p. 19)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The unit of randomisation is the school ("whole schools ... assigned at
      random"), which is stronger than the minimum class-level requirement for
      criterion C. The randomisation process is described and was conducted by
      the evaluation team.

      Criterion C is met because whole schools were randomly assigned to
      intervention and control conditions.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The primary outcome for this study was attainment in KS3 Year 7
      mathematics as defined by the NWEA MAP Growth Standardised
      Assessment." (p. 21)

      2) "The online assessments are completed in the Autumn, Spring and
      Summer term and are standardised to US measures to allow for
      international comparisons for the grant funders." (p. 21)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study used NWEA MAP Growth, described as a "Standardised
      Assessment" and "standardised to US measures", as the primary outcome.
      This is not a bespoke researcher-made test, so it satisfies the ERCT
      requirement for an external standardised exam-based assessment.

      Criterion E is met because the primary outcome measure was the
      standardised NWEA MAP Growth assessment.
    quote: >-
      The primary outcome for this study was attainment in KS3 Year 7
      mathematics as defined by the NWEA MAP Growth Standardised
      Assessment.
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured using the standardised NWEA MAP Growth
      assessment rather than a custom test.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The Eedi programme was used in intervention schools from Autumn
      2023 to June 2024 to supplement classroom teaching, with the control
      schools not using the programme." (p. 3)

      2) "All participating Year 7 pupils completed the 45-minute online
      pre-test under examination conditions in the initial assessment window
      in September 2023, mid-point assessment in February 2024 and
      post-assessment in July 2024." (p. 21)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention began in Autumn 2023 and outcomes were measured again
      at post-assessment in July 2024. This is well beyond the minimum
      requirement of one academic term (3-4 months) from intervention start to
      outcome measurement.

      Criterion T is met because the time from intervention start to the final
      outcome measurement spans far longer than one term.
    quote: >-

      The study followed students from Autumn 2023 through the July 2024
      post-assessment, exceeding one full term.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Schools were only recruited if they did not currently use Eedi in
      Year 7 and if they agreed to participate and withhold the release of
      Eedi to Year 7 if they were selected as the control." (p. 20)

      2) "Each school was allocated an anonymous ID and Eedi used the DfE
      performance tables and a WhatWorked School look up to record the
      current progress 8 score, attainment 8 score, percentage of schools
      eligible for Pupil Premium (PP), percentage of pupils with English not
      as their first language (EAL) and school type." (p. 19)

      3) "The process evaluation also sheds light on the ‘business as usual’
      practices in control schools, which were similar to intervention schools
      in terms of homework frequency and duration." (p. 49)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The control condition is explicitly defined as schools withholding access
      to Eedi for Year 7. The report documents baseline school characteristics
      using official sources (DfE performance tables) and identifies the main
      features of "business as usual" in control schools. This is sufficient
      documentation to understand who the control group is and what they did.

      Criterion D is met because the control group is clearly described and
      baseline characteristics and practices are documented.
    quote: >-

      The report documents the control group definition, baseline school
      characteristics, and control schools business as usual practices.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This impact evaluation included 20 schools, with randomisation at
      school level." (p. 3)

      2) "This study was designed as a randomised controlled trial with whole
      schools (Year 7) assigned at random to either intervention (exposure to
      Eedi) or control conditions (non-exposure to Eedi) on a 1:1 basis."
      (p. 19)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The unit of allocation is the school, and the report states that 20
      schools took part. This satisfies ERCT criterion S, which requires
      school-level randomisation rather than only within-school class-level
      allocation.

      Criterion S is met because schools (not just classes) were randomly
      assigned to conditions.
    quote: >-
      This impact evaluation included 20 schools, with randomisation at school
      level.
    explanation: >-
      Twenty schools were randomised at the school level, satisfying the
      school-level RCT requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Randomisation was carried out by the WhatWorked team who were
      ‘blind’ as to the identity of schools." (p. 19)

      2) "The Eedi project is being delivered by Eedi in partnership with
      WhatWorked Education. Eedi are an education technology company
      (developers) and WhatWorked are a research evidence company
      (evaluators)." (p. 67)

      3) "The project is funded by Eedi with the aim of developing an evidence
      base for the impact of their programme in schools." (p. 67)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The report distinguishes the developer (Eedi) from the evaluator
      (WhatWorked Education). Randomisation was conducted by the WhatWorked
      team and they report being blind to school identity during randomisation.
      Although the project is funded by Eedi, the evaluation is described as
      being carried out by a separate research evidence company.

      Criterion I is met because the evaluation and randomisation were carried
      out by an organisation separate from the intervention developer.
    quote: >-
      Eedi are an education technology company (developers) and WhatWorked
      are a research evidence company (evaluators).
    explanation: >-
      The report separates the developer from the evaluator, with WhatWorked
      conducting randomisation and evaluation activities.

      in September 2023, mid-point assessment in February 2024 and
      post-assessment in July 2024." (p. 21)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention covered the 2023-2024 academic year and outcomes were
      tracked from September 2023 through July 2024, which is approximately a
      full school year. This satisfies the ERCT year-duration requirement.

      Criterion Y is met because the study tracked outcomes across a full
      academic year.
    quote: >-

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Reported frequency of maths homework was similar across
      intervention and control schools, with responding teachers in both
      groups reporting that maths homework is typically set by class teachers
      once a week (intervention n=56, control n=50)." (p. 52)

      2) "Reported duration of maths homework was similar across intervention
      and control schools, with responding teachers in both groups reporting
      that maths homework should take students approximately 30 minutes to
      complete (intervention n=34, control n=35)" (p. 53)

      3) "Control schools, on the other hand, displayed a broader usage of
      various online platforms throughout the trial. The most commonly used
      platforms in control schools were MathsWatch and Sparx, both of which
      are considered robust tools for addressing misconceptions and supporting
      students through targeted feedback and practice." (p. 54)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The key resource inputs relevant to this intervention are time and effort
      spent on maths homework and access to an online homework platform.
      Teacher survey data indicates similar homework frequency (once per week)
      and duration (about 30 minutes) in both groups. Control schools also used
      other well-known online maths platforms, suggesting that the intervention
      did not add materially more time or resources beyond business as usual.

      Criterion B is met because homework time expectations were similar and
      control schools used comparable online platforms.
    quote: >-

    explanation: >-
      The intervention did not add unbalanced time or resources: homework
      frequency and duration were similar and controls used other platforms.

      1) "This study follows on from an initial pilot in Year 1 for a pilot
      impact study to test the effectiveness of Eedi in KS3 mathematics in UK
      schools (Harrison, Brown & Higgins, 2023)." (p. 17)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The report cites a prior pilot study by the same author group, but it does
      not cite any independent replication conducted by a different research
      team and published in a peer-reviewed journal. A search of publicly
      available sources did not identify a peer-reviewed, independent
      reproduction of this specific 2023-2024 school-level RCT.

      mathematics as defined by the NWEA MAP Growth Standardised
      Assessment." (p. 21)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study reports outcomes for mathematics only. There is no evidence in
      the report that standardised assessments were also collected for other
      core subjects (for example, reading/language arts or science) to test for
      cross-subject trade-offs.

      Criterion A is not met because only mathematics attainment was assessed.

      1) "Schools were allocated to intervention and control conditions using
      random allocation on a 1:1 basis for access to Eedi for the Year 7 cohort
      for the academic year 2023-24." (p. 19)

      2) "All participating Year 7 pupils completed the 45-minute online
      pre-test under examination conditions in the initial assessment window
      in September 2023, mid-point assessment in February 2024 and

      Detailed Analysis:

      The reported follow-up ends with the post-assessment in July 2024 for the
      Year 7 cohort. The report does not describe any subsequent tracking of
      these pupils through to graduation (for example, GCSE completion in Year
      11), and no later follow-up publication by the same team reporting
      graduation outcomes was located.

      Criterion G is not met because students were not tracked until
      graduation.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The report does not mention pre-registration, trial registration, or a
      public protocol identifier (for example OSF, ISRCTN, or a registry link)
      dated before the intervention began. A search of major registries and the
      open web did not locate a public pre-registered protocol for this study.

      Criterion P is not met because no pre-registered protocol could be
