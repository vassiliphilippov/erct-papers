abstract: >-
  Time‑management skills are an essential component of college student
  success, especially in online classes. Through a randomized control
  trial of students in a for‑credit online course at a public 4‑year
  university, we test the efficacy of a scheduling intervention aimed at
  improving students’ time management. Results indicate the intervention
  had positive effects on initial achievement scores; students who were
  given the opportunity to schedule their lecture watching in advance
  scored about a third of a standard deviation better on the first quiz
  than students who were not given that opportunity. These effects are
  concentrated in students with the lowest self‑reported time‑management
  skills. However, these effects diminish over time such that we see a
  marginally significant negative effect of treatment on the last week’s
  quiz grade and no difference in overall course scores. We examine the
  effect of the intervention on plausible mechanisms to explain the
  observed achievement effects and find no evidence that the
  intervention affected cramming, procrastination, or the time at which
  students did work.&#8203;

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students were randomly assigned into treatment (N=79) and control
      (N=78) groups on the first day of the course."&#8203;

      2) "The suggestion was delivered to a randomly selected group of
      students in each of the first 2 weeks of the course."&#8203;

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomization occurred at the individual‑student level within a
      single online class section. Under ERCT criterion C,
      randomization must occur at the whole‑class (or stronger) level
      unless the intervention is one‑to‑one tutoring. Because students in
      the same class could interact and contamination is possible, the
      design does not satisfy the class‑level requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is not met because randomization was at
      the student, not class, level.

    explanation: >-
      Individual‑level randomization within one class violates the
      class‑level RCT requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Except for the week 1 quiz, which had a maximum score of 15, all
      of the other quizzes had a maximum score of 6 … Students’ final
      grades were determined by … weekly quizzes … and the final exam
      score."&#8203;

      2) "We focus our analyses on the weekly quiz scores and final course
      grade…"&#8203;

      Detailed Analysis:

      Outcome measures consist of instructor‑created weekly quizzes and a
      course‑specific final exam. No evidence is given that these are
      externally standardized assessments.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because only instructor
      tests, not standardized exams, were used.
    quote: >-
      "Except for the week 1 quiz … all of the other quizzes had a maximum
      score of 6."
    explanation: >-
      Assessments were custom course quizzes and a final, not a
      standardized exam.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We conducted our study in an online undergraduate STEM course
      lasting 5 weeks in a selective, public 4‑year university."&#8203;

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention and all outcome measurements occurred within a
      single 5‑week summer term—much shorter than a regular 3‑ to
      4‑month academic term required by ERCT.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is not met because tracking lasted only
      five weeks.
    quote: >-
      "…course lasting 5 weeks…"
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were collected after only five weeks, not a full term.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Table 1 presents summary statistics on student characteristics
      for the analytic sample, the treatment group, and the control
      group."&#8203;

      2) "The control students received emails from the course instructor
      asking them to respond to an online survey…"&#8203;

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper supplies demographic, baseline, and outcome data for the
      control group, and clearly describes the ‘business‑as‑usual’
      condition (placebo emails only). This satisfies documentation
      expectations.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met; the control group is thoroughly
      documented.
    quote: >-
      "Table 1 presents summary statistics … treatment group, and the
      control group."

      Demographics and baseline performance for the control group are

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomization occurred at the student level within one university
      course, not at the whole‑school level required for criterion S.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met.

      and the final exam score."&#8203;

      Detailed Analysis:

      Learning outcomes cover only the focal STEM course; the study does
      not assess other academic subjects, so it fails the all‑subject
      requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because only one subject was
      tested.
    quote: >-
      "…weekly quizzes … and the final exam score."
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes are limited to a single STEM course, not all subjects.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention and measurement window was five weeks—far less
      than the one‑year duration required for criterion Y.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met.
    quote: >-
      "Each is only 5 weeks long…"

      Study duration was five weeks, not a full academic year.

      1) "In order to ensure that the control students had an equal number
      of contacts from the instructor … control students received an
      email …"&#8203;

      2) "We provided control students with an emailed survey … it ensured
      that students received an equal number of contacts from the
      instructor."&#8203;

      Detailed Analysis:

      The only resource added by the intervention was the content of the
      scheduling survey. Control students received parallel emails and
      extra‑credit opportunities, matching contact time and incentives.
      No additional instructional time, tutoring, or budget differential
      existed.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is met; resources were balanced across
      groups.
    quote: >-
      "…ensured that students received an equal number of contacts from
      the instructor."
    explanation: >-
      Control and treatment groups received equivalent emails and
      incentives; no extra resources favored treatment.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "…the course also had a final exam that was held on campus on the
      last day of the course."&#8203;

      Detailed Analysis:

      Outcomes were measured only up to the final exam at week 5; the
      study did not track students through course completion or later
      graduation milestones.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because there is no
      post‑course follow‑up.
    quote: >-
      "…final exam … on the last day of the course."
    explanation: >-
      No tracking beyond the short 5‑week course was conducted.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The article reports no independent replication, and a literature
      search within the paper finds no mention of other teams repeating
      the same intervention in a separate context.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met; results have not been
      independently reproduced.

      internal lab.&#8203;

      Detailed Analysis:

      The research team designed the intervention, implemented it within
      their own institution, and analyzed the data—no external evaluator
      participated.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met; conduct was not independent
      of developers.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The manuscript contains no registration ID, registry name, or
      statement of pre‑registration. A text search of the PDF reveals no
      occurrence of "prereg" or "registration" related to a study
      protocol.

      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met; the study was not
      pre‑registered.

      No evidence of prospective trial registration is provided.
