  This article evaluates the impact that facilitated discussions about girls’
  education have on education outcomes for students in rural Zimbabwe. The
  staggered implementation of components of a randomized education project
  allowed for the causal analysis of a dialogue-based engagement campaign. This
  campaign involved regular discussions between trained facilitators and
  parents, teachers, and youth about girls’ rights, the importance of attending
  school, and the barriers girls face in pursuing education. The campaigns
  increased mathematics performance and enrollment in the year after
  implementation. There was no similar improvement in literacy performance
  during this period. Longer-term data on the broader project suggest that
  adding additional education-focused interventions did not further increase
  mathematics performance and enrollment beyond what can be attributable to the
  dialogue campaigns alone.

      Randomization was at the school level, which satisfies the class-level RCT
      requirement.

      "The program was implemented in randomly selected
      schools across 10 rural districts in Zimbabwe and is estimated to have
      reached 48,773 girls." (p. 214)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The program was implemented in randomly selected
      schools across 10 rural districts in Zimbabwe and is estimated to have
      reached 48,773 girls." (p. 214)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomization at the class level (or stronger). The
      paper states that schools were "randomly selected," implying a school-level
      cluster randomized design. School-level randomization is stronger than
      class-level randomization and therefore satisfies criterion C.

      Final summary: Criterion C is met because randomization occurred at the
      school level.

      Outcomes were measured using EGRA and EGMA, which are standardized
      assessment systems.

      "Girls also took the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) and Early Grade
      Mathematics Assessment (EGMA)." (p. 218)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Girls also took the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) and Early
      Grade Mathematics Assessment
      (EGMA)." (p. 218)

      2) "The EGRA and EGMA have strict development guidelines that ensure the
      difficulty level is standard-
      ized across versions." (p. 218)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized, widely recognized exam-based assessment
      rather than custom-made tests. The study used EGRA and EGMA and explicitly
      describes them as having "strict development guidelines" ensuring
      standardization across versions. This supports that outcomes were assessed
      with standardized instruments.

      Final summary: Criterion E is met because EGRA and EGMA are standardized
      assessment systems used to measure outcomes.

      Midline outcomes were measured about 1.5 years after implementation began,
      exceeding one academic term.
    quote: >-
      "Baseline data collection
      occurred before implementation began in February 2014. Midline data
      collection took place a year and a
      half later, in June–August 2015." (p. 216)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Baseline data collection
      occurred before implementation began in February 2014. Midline data
      collection took place a year and a
      half later, in June–August 2015." (p. 216)

      2) "The staggered implementation and its align-
      ment with data collection points allow us to measure the short-term impact
      of the dialogue-based en-
      gagement efforts by midline, nine months to one year after dialogues were
      introduced." (p. 213)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that outcomes are measured at least one full academic
      term after the intervention begins (typically 3-4 months). The paper states
      implementation began in February 2014 and midline measurement occurred in
      June–August 2015, about 16-18 months later. The paper also describes
      measuring impacts "nine months to one year after dialogues were introduced,"
      which exceeds one term.

      Final summary: Criterion T is met because outcomes were measured well over
      one term after the intervention began.

      The control group is described with sample sizes and baseline characteristics,
      including a baseline balance table.
    quote: >-
      "The evaluation sample included 37 treatment and 28 control locations."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The evaluation sample included 37 treatment and 28 control locations."
      (p. 217)

      2) "At midline, 385 and 557 girls are in the control and treatment samples,
      respectively." (p. 217)

      3) "Table 1. Baseline Summary Statistics" (p. 218)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control group is well documented (size and
      baseline characteristics). The paper reports the number of treatment and
      control locations and provides midline sample sizes for each group. It also
      provides a baseline summary statistics table (Table 1) comparing observable
      characteristics between control and treatment groups, supporting clear
      documentation of the control condition.

      Final summary: Criterion D is met because the control group is clearly
      described and baseline characteristics are reported.

      Treatment was assigned at the school level, meeting the school-level RCT
      requirement.

      schools across 10 rural districts in Zimbabwe and is estimated to have
      reached 48,773 girls." (p. 214)

      2) "Since the treatment
      was applied at the school level, and participation in the interventions was
      voluntary, this specification
      estimates the project’s intent-to-treat effect." (p. 219)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the school level. The paper states
      that the program was implemented in "randomly selected schools" and later
      explicitly notes that "treatment was applied at the school level." This is
      direct confirmation that assignment was at the school (cluster) level.

      Final summary: Criterion S is met because the unit of treatment assignment
      was the school.

      Data collection involved an external firm and the authors analyze secondary
      data rather than directly implementing the intervention.
    quote: >-
      "The data collection was funded by the UK government’s Girls’ Education
      Challenge fund and conducted by Miske Witt & Associates in collaboration
      with World Vision, the program implementer,
      and PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLC, the UK Aid Girls’ Education Challenge fund
      manager." (p. 211)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A preliminary exploration of the data by the research team was funded
      by World Vision Canada and conducted through Limestone Analytics, where
      Cotton holds a secondary affiliation and where
      Nordstrom and Nanowski previously worked." (p. 211)

      2) "The data collection was funded by the UK government’s Girls’ Education
      Challenge fund and conducted by Miske Witt & Associates in collaboration
      with World Vision, the program implementer,
      and PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLC, the UK Aid Girls’ Education Challenge fund
      manager." (p. 211)

      3) "World Vision provided the data set
      to the research team for academic research;" (p. 211)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the study is conducted independently from the
      intervention designers. The intervention was implemented by a consortium
      led by World Vision, while data collection was conducted by professional
      enumerators from a Zimbabwe-based firm and (per acknowledgments) by Miske
      Witt & Associates in collaboration with the implementer and fund manager.
      The authors are academics and analyze secondary data provided for academic
      research. The acknowledgments disclose that a preliminary exploration was
      funded by World Vision Canada and conducted through Limestone Analytics,
      which is a potential source of influence, but the main paper positions the
      analysis as academic research on secondary data rather than an internal
      self-evaluation by the implementers.

      Final summary: Criterion I is met because the analysis is conducted by an
      external academic team using secondary data, with disclosed relationships.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcomes to be measured at least one full academic
      year after intervention start. The paper reports an interval from
      implementation start (February 2014) to midline measurement (June–August
      2015) of about 16-18 months, which exceeds a typical academic year.

      Final summary: Criterion Y is met because the time from implementation
      start to outcome measurement exceeds one academic year.

      The intervention adds facilitated discussions, and those added resources are
      the treatment being tested rather than an uncontrolled add-on.

      education have on education outcomes

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This article evaluates the impact that facilitated discussions about girls’
      education have on education outcomes
      for students in rural Zimbabwe." (p. 211)

      2) "The dialogue sessions provided a setting for participants to comfortably
      discuss a guided set of topics
      in the presence of a trained facilitator." (p. 215)

      3) "The program provided no financial
      assistance or other resources to these groups or their members." (p. 215)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B requires comparable time and resources in treatment and control
      unless the additional resources are the treatment variable itself. The
      intervention consists of facilitated, structured discussions led by trained
      facilitators, which are additional time and personnel inputs relative to
      business-as-usual. The paper explicitly frames the causal question as the
      impact of these facilitated discussions. Therefore, the additional time and
      facilitation resources are integral to the intervention definition, not a
      confounding add-on that should be matched in the control condition.

      Final summary: Criterion B is met because the added resources (facilitated
      discussions) are the central treatment being evaluated.

      outcomes." (p. 214)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication by other authors in a
      different context, published in a peer-reviewed venue. The paper positions
      itself as "the first" to provide causal evidence for this mechanism in
      education, and it does not cite any independent replication of the same
      intervention and evaluation. Based on accessible sources reviewed for this
      ERCT check, no clear independent reproduction of this specific study was
      verifiable.

      Final summary: Criterion R is not met because independent reproduction was
      not identified or verifiable.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized assessments across all main subjects. The
      paper reports outcomes using EGMA (mathematics) and EGRA (reading) only. It
      does not report standardized outcomes for other core subject areas.

      Final summary: Criterion A is not met because only mathematics and reading
      were assessed.

      1) "Endline
      data collection occurred in November–December 2016, at the end of the project."
      (p. 216)

      2) "The analysis is
      limited to girls in grade seven or below (i.e., in primary school) at baseline
      for clarity of interpretation." (p. 217)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation. The study’s
      endline data collection occurred at the end of the project in late 2016.
      The analyzed cohort includes girls in Grade 7 or below at baseline, so many
      participants would not have reached graduation by the endline window. The
      paper provides no evidence of follow-up tracking until graduation for the
      full cohort.

      Final summary: Criterion G is not met because tracking ends at project endline
      rather than at participant graduation.

      The study reports AEA RCT Registry registration, but the registry entry timing
      could not be verified from accessible sources for this check.

      2) "The registry record is available at https://www. socialscienceregistry. org/trials/7963 ."
      (p. 217)

      3) "Baseline data collection
      occurred before implementation began in February 2014." (p. 216)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the protocol is pre-registered before the study
      begins. The paper states that the trial was registered and provides a
      registry URL, and it also states that baseline data collection occurred
      before implementation began in February 2014. However, during this ERCT
      check, the AEA registry entry itself was not accessible for verification of
      the registration date, so the timing relative to February 2014 could not be
      confirmed.

      Final summary: Criterion P is not met because pre-registration timing could
      not be verified from accessible sources for this check.
