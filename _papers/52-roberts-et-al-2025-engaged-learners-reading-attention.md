abstract: >-
  We investigate the efficacy of a reading intervention integrated with
  Engaged Learners, a program that applies behavioral and cognitive
  principles to increase student behavioral attention and reduce
  distractions during instruction. Using a three-arm randomized
  controlled trial, we randomized 159 Grade 3-5 students with
  co-occurring reading and behavioral attention challenges to a
  researcher-implemented small group reading intervention with Engaged
  Learners (READ +ENGAGE), an identical researcher-implemented reading
  intervention without Engaged Learners (READ), or a Business-as-Usual
  (BaU) condition. The READ +ENGAGE condition students demonstrated
  statistically significant greater behavioral attention according to
  direct observations and interventionist reports than READ condition
  students. The pattern of reading effect sizes contrasting the
  conditions suggests that the READ +ENGAGE and READ conditions were
  associated with higher performance on reading outcomes than the BaU
  condition and students in the READ condition significantly
  outperformed the BaU condition on measures of word reading, fluency
  and reading comprehension, and mid-transfer vocabulary and reading
  comprehension. We also explored whether integrating the Engaged
  Learners program in a reading intervention would be associated with
  improved reading outcomes by contrasting the READ + ENGAGE to the READ
  condition; however, the findings did not support this hypothesis.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Student-level randomization is acceptable here because the
      intervention is delivered as small-group tutoring (2-4 students).
    quote: >-
      "This process resulted in 159 students randomized 1:1:1, blocked
      on school and grade." (p. 6)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This process resulted in 159 students randomized 1:1:1, blocked
      on school and grade." (p. 6)

      2) "Intervention group sizes ranged from two to four students and
      took place outside of the core reading block." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires class-level (or stronger) randomization to
      avoid contamination, but ERCT allows an exception when the
      intervention is personal teaching like tutoring. The paper states
      students were randomized (not classes) and that intervention groups
      were small (two to four students) and conducted outside the core
      reading block, which matches a tutoring-like delivery model.

      Therefore, although randomization is at the student level, the
      tutoring exception applies and Criterion C is met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met/not met because the
      intervention is delivered as small-group tutoring, so student-level
      randomization is acceptable under the ERCT exception.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study used widely recognized standardized reading assessments
      (TOWRE-2, TOSREC, GMRT) with standard scores and reported
      reliability.
    quote: >-
      "Results are reported in standard scores." (p. 6)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Results are reported in standard scores." (p. 6)

      2) "The TOSREC (Wagner et al., 2010) is a 3-minute
      group-administered test of reading fluency and comprehension."
      (p. 7)

      3) "Internal consistency reliability ranges from .91 to .93, and
      the Kuder-Richardson reliability statistic ranges from .92 to .93."
      (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized exam-based assessments (not
      custom tests aligned to the intervention). The paper uses multiple
      established standardized instruments: TOWRE-2 and TOSREC report
      standard scores, and GMRT reports high internal consistency and
      Kuder-Richardson reliability. Although the paper also includes
      "mid-transfer" measures created from curriculum items, the presence
      of multiple standardized tests as outcomes satisfies Criterion E.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is met/not met because the
      primary outcomes include established standardized reading exams.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured after an intervention period running from
      October to February, which exceeds one academic term.
    quote: >-
      "researcher-hired interventionists delivered 30-40-minute
      intervention lessons for 3-5 days per week from October to
      February." (p. 8)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "researcher-hired interventionists delivered 30-40-minute
      intervention lessons for 3-5 days per week from October to
      February." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcome measurement at least one academic term
      after the intervention begins (typically about 3-4 months). The
      intervention ran "from October to February", which is roughly 4-5
      months, and posttest data were collected at the end of this period.
      This exceeds one term.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met/not met because the
      October-to-February timeline spans more than a full academic term.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The Business-as-Usual control is described and the paper reports
      control-group demographics and details of services received.
    quote: >-
      "The BaU condition students received instruction as determined by
      their schools without input or support from the research team."
      (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The BaU condition students received instruction as determined
      by their schools without input or support from the research team."
      (p. 4)

      2) "Table 1. Demographic Characteristics of the Analytic Sample"
      (p. 7)

      3) "Data indicated that school personnel delivered at least one
      reading intervention to 59.52% ... of the BaU ... students."
      (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires a well-documented control group (who they are,
      baseline characteristics, and what they received). The paper
      defines the BaU condition, provides demographic characteristics by
      condition (Table 1), and quantifies school-provided interventions
      received by each condition, including BaU. This is sufficient
      documentation to interpret comparisons.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met/not met because the
      BaU group is clearly described and supported with demographics and
      services-received data.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization occurred at the student level within schools rather
      than at the school level.
    quote: >-
      "This process resulted in 159 students randomized 1:1:1, blocked
      on school and grade." (p. 6)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This process resulted in 159 students randomized 1:1:1, blocked
      on school and grade." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level randomization (schools assigned to
      conditions). The quote shows students were randomized and merely
      blocked by school and grade. That is not school-level assignment.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is met/not met because the
      unit of randomization was students, not schools.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The authors developed the Engaged Learners program and the study
      was researcher-implemented with coaching by the first author.
    quote: >-
      "Our team developed the Engaged Learners program ..." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Our team developed the Engaged Learners program ..." (p. 3)

      2) "...randomized Grade 3-5 students ... to a
      researcher-delivered reading intervention ..." (p. 4)

      3) "Bi-weekly-or as needed-coaching was provided ... by doctoral
      students or the first author." (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires independent conduct by an external evaluator.
      The paper explicitly states the authors' team developed Engaged
      Learners, the interventions were researcher-delivered, and coaching
      was provided by the first author or doctoral students. No external
      independent evaluation team is described.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is met/not met because the
      intervention developers also implemented and oversaw delivery.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention and measurement window (October to February) is
      under a full academic year.
    quote: >-
      "researcher-hired interventionists delivered 30-40-minute
      intervention lessons for 3-5 days per week from October to
      February." (p. 8)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "researcher-hired interventionists delivered 30-40-minute
      intervention lessons for 3-5 days per week from October to
      February." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcomes measured at least one full academic
      year after the intervention begins (about 9-10 months in typical
      K-12 contexts). The stated October-to-February period is about
      4-5 months, so it does not meet the year-duration requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is met/not met because the
      stated study timeline is substantially shorter than a full academic
      year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention adds substantial instructional time and staffing,
      but these added resources are integral to what the study is testing
      against Business-as-Usual.
    quote: >-
      "researcher-hired interventionists delivered 30-40-minute
      intervention lessons for 3-5 days per week from October to
      February." (p. 8)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "researcher-hired interventionists delivered 30-40-minute
      intervention lessons for 3-5 days per week from October to
      February." (p. 8)

      2) "Intervention group sizes ranged from two to four students and
      took place outside of the core reading block." (p. 8)

      3) "The BaU condition students received instruction as determined
      by their schools without input or support from the research team."
      (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B asks whether time, budget, and staffing inputs are
      balanced between intervention and control, unless the added inputs
      are the treatment variable (or are integral to the intervention as
      defined and tested). Here, both active conditions receive a
      researcher-implemented small-group reading intervention delivered
      by researcher-hired interventionists outside the core reading
      block, which clearly adds instructional time and staffing relative
      to BaU.

      The paper's research questions explicitly compare the packaged
      interventions (READ and READ+ENGAGE) against Business-as-Usual,
      meaning the added tutoring time and staffing are integral to the
      defined intervention being evaluated, rather than an incidental
      add-on that should be matched by a placebo activity. Between the
      two active arms (READ vs READ+ENGAGE), delivery format and dosage
      are intended to be comparable, with differences focused on the
      Engaged Learners components.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met/not met because the
      added resources (small-group tutoring delivered by hired staff) are
      an integral part of the intervention package being tested against
      Business-as-Usual.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No peer-reviewed independent replication by other authors was
      found, and the paper itself calls for future replications.
    quote: >-
      "Replications of this study should consider its use." (p. 15)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Replications of this study should consider its use." (p. 15)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent reproduction by a different
      research team in a different context, published in a peer-reviewed
      journal. The paper itself frames replication as a future need.

      An internet search (as of 2025-12-30) did not identify any
      peer-reviewed studies by other author teams that explicitly report
      an independent replication of this specific three-arm RCT (READ +
      ENGAGE vs READ vs BaU) with the same Engaged Learners integration.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is met/not met because no
      independent peer-reviewed replication was found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study measured reading and attention outcomes only, not
      standardized outcomes across all core subjects.
    quote: >-
      "Reading Outcomes ... Attention Outcomes ..." (pp. 13-14)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Reading Outcomes" (p. 13)

      2) "Attention Outcomes" (p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized, exam-based measurement across
      all main subjects (not just the targeted domain) to detect possible
      trade-offs. This study reports reading outcomes and behavioral
      attention outcomes, and does not report standardized measures in
      other core subjects (for example mathematics or science). Therefore
      the all-subject requirement is not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is met/not met because the
      outcomes cover reading and attention only, not all core subjects.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not track students to graduation, and Criterion G
      cannot be met because Criterion Y is not met.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "researcher-hired interventionists delivered 30-40-minute
      intervention lessons for 3-5 days per week from October to
      February." (p. 8)

      2) "Graduate assistants (GA) ... coded each student's behavioral
      attention from a randomly selected pretest (baseline) and posttest
      (last 2 weeks) video-recorded lesson." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation, and
      ERCT specifies that if Criterion Y (year duration) is not met then
      Criterion G is not met. This study's described timeline runs from
      October to February with pretest and posttest measurement, which is
      far shorter than year-long tracking, and there is no description of
      tracking students through an educational-stage graduation.

      An internet search (as of 2025-12-30) did not identify follow-up
      papers by the same authors reporting graduation tracking for this
      cohort.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is met/not met because the
      study is short-term (under a year) and no graduation-tracking
      follow-up was found.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The authors explicitly state that the study was not pre-registered.
    quote: >-
      "This study's design, hypotheses, and data analytic plan were not
      pre-registered." (p. 12)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study's design, hypotheses, and data analytic plan were not
      pre-registered." (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires a pre-registered protocol with registration
      occurring before data collection begins. The paper explicitly states
      the design, hypotheses, and analytic plan were not pre-registered,
      so the criterion is not met and no registry verification is needed.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is met/not met because the
      authors state the study was not pre-registered.
