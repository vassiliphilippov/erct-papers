  Background and context: Early childhood computer science (CS) education is a
  high-priority focus worldwide, but early childhood CS tools are primarily developed
  and researched within the United States and Europe. As an example, the Coding as Another
  Language ScratchJr (CAL-ScratchJr) curriculum is used in multiple countries but was
  developed and evaluated in the United States. Objectives: This paper describes the
  implementation and evaluation of an adapted CAL-ScratchJr curriculum in Mendoza and
  Corrientes, Argentina. Method: We used mixed methods and a cluster-randomized control
  trial to evaluate curriculum success, measured by validated assessments and teacher
  interviews. Findings: The curriculum significantly improved student coding knowledge
  and computational thinking. Teachers saw the curriculum as successful across multiple
  domains. Implications: These findings reinforce that the success of CS education
  programs should be evaluated not only with internationally validated assessments but
  also by local understandings of success.

      "Schools were randomly assigned to teach the CAL-ScratchJr curriculum or
      the control condition."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We used mixed methods and a cluster-randomized control trial to evaluate
      curriculum success" (p. 2)

      2) "This study was designed as a cluster-randomized control trial, so to
      answer this research question, we used a three-level multilevel growth
      model with students' assessment scores as the independent variable, nested
      at the student level and finally at the school level." (p. 11)

      3) "Seventeen schools across the Corrientes and Mendoza provinces took part
      in the CAL-ScratchJr Argentina Project. Schools were randomly assigned to
      teach the CAL-ScratchJr curriculum or the control condition." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires the study to be a Randomized Controlled Trial
      (RCT) conducted at the class level or higher to prevent contamination. The
      authors explicitly state that the randomization occurred at the school
      level ("Schools were randomly assigned"), which is a stronger unit of
      randomization than the class level. Therefore, the requirement for
      class-level randomization is automatically satisfied.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met because the study utilized
      a cluster-randomized design where randomization occurred at the school
      level.
    explanation: Randomization was performed at the school level, satisfying the
      requirement for class-level assignment.

      "Coding knowledge... was evaluated using the Coding Stages Assessment (CSA)...
      The TechCheck assessments evaluated computational thinking"
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Coding knowledge, defined as knowledge of the ScratchJr coding
      language and its' syntax, was evaluated using the Coding Stages Assessment
      (CSA) (de Ruiter & Bers, 2021)." (p. 10)

      2) "The TechCheck assessments evaluated computational thinking, as defined
      by the cognitive skills necessary for coding (e.g. sequencing,
      abstraction) divorced from any one coding language (Relkin & Bers, 2021;
      Relkin et al., 2020, 2023)." (p. 10)

      3) "In Argentina, testing begins in third grade..." (p. 16)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires the use of standardized, widely recognized
      exam-based assessments (e.g., state or national exams) and explicitly
      excludes assessments specially designed for the study or specific to the
      intervention. The study uses the Coding Stages Assessment (CSA) and
      TechCheck. While the paper notes these have been "previously validated,"
      they are specific instruments developed by the research group (DevTech/Bers
      et al.) specifically for assessing coding and computational thinking in
      early childhood, rather than standard, widely recognized exams. Furthermore,
      the authors acknowledge that standard testing in Argentina only begins in
      third grade, implying these students (K-2) were not subject to standard
      exams.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is not met because the assessments
      used were specific research instruments developed by the authors' lab rather
      than widely recognized standardized exams.
    explanation: The study utilized specific assessments developed by the research
      group (CSA and TechCheck) rather than widely recognized standardized exams.

      "The curricula... consist of 24 45-minute lesson plans"
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The curricula, freely available online for kindergarten, first, and
      second grade, consist of 24 45-minute lesson plans..." (p. 4)

      2) "Teachers then implemented the 24-lesson coding curriculum in the
      classroom. During the curriculum, teachers were given a mid-curriculum
      survey... Finally, following the curriculum... students completed
      post-curriculum assessments." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires that outcomes be measured at least one full
      academic term (approx. 3-4 months) after the intervention begins. The text
      specifies the curriculum consists of "24 45-minute lesson plans." While 24
      lessons could theoretically span a term (e.g., if taught twice a week for
      12 weeks), the paper does not explicitly state the start and end dates of
      the intervention or the total duration in weeks/months. Without a quoted
      time interval confirming the duration was at least one term, the criterion
      cannot be confirmed as met according to the strict documentation requirements.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is not met because the specific
      calendar duration of the intervention is not explicitly stated, only the
      number of lesson plans.
    explanation: The paper specifies the number of lessons but does not provide specific
      dates or a duration interval to confirm the intervention spanned at least one full academic term.

      "Schools in the control condition participated in their daily activities...
      This did not include a standardized CS program"
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Schools in the control condition participated in their daily
      activities, with teachers receiving only their standard professional
      development and teaching their standard curriculum. This did not include a
      standardized CS program..." (p. 8)

      2) "Table 1. Distribution of students by gender, condition, and grade." (p.
      9) [Table lists Control totals: Girls 56+41+41, Boys 70+52+56, Total
      126+93+97]

      3) "17 schools, 9 in Corrientes and 8 in Mendoza." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires detailed documentation of the control group,
      including demographics and conditions. The paper provides a clear description
      of the control condition ("business as usual," no standardized CS program)
      and provides a specific breakdown of the control group's participants by
      grade and gender in Table 1.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because the authors
      provided demographic data and a clear description of the business-as-usual
      conditions for the control group.
    explanation: The control group's demographics are tabulated, and their
      "business as usual" condition is clearly described.

      "Schools were randomly assigned to teach the CAL-ScratchJr curriculum or
      the control condition."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The schools served as the clustering level, as teachers work within
      school communities." (p. 8)

      2) "Seventeen schools across the Corrientes and Mendoza provinces took part
      in the CAL-ScratchJr Argentina Project." (p. 8)

      3) "Schools were randomly assigned to teach the CAL-ScratchJr curriculum or
      the control condition." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires randomization at the school level. The paper
      explicitly states that the school was the unit of clustering and randomization
      ("Schools were randomly assigned").

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is met because the randomization
      was conducted at the school level.
    explanation: The study randomized entire schools rather than classes or
      students, satisfying the school-level RCT requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The Coding as Another Language for ScratchJr (CAL-ScratchJr) curricula
      were developed by the DevTech research group..." (p. 4)

      2) "Coding as another language: an early childhood programming curriculum in
      Argentina... Tess Levinson, Francisca Carocca P & Marina Bers" (p. 2)

      3) "Our process included first identification and open coding by two
      authors of teacher quotes... One author is a white American woman... The
      other author is a Latin American woman..." (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires the study to be conducted independently from the
      authors who designed the intervention. The intervention (CAL-ScratchJr) was
      developed by the DevTech research group, led by author Marina Bers. The
      authors of this paper (Levinson, Carocca, Bers) are directly involved in
      the research, data coding, and analysis. While they partnered with the
      Varkey Foundation for implementation, the analysis was conducted by the
      authors themselves.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is not met because the authors of
      the paper are the developers of the curriculum and conducted the analysis.
    explanation: The study was conducted and analyzed by the same researchers who
      developed the curriculum.

      the curriculum... students completed post-curriculum assessments." (p. 8)

      2) "The curricula... consist of 24 45-minute lesson plans" (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires outcomes to be measured at least one full academic
      year after the intervention begins. As established in the analysis for criterion
      T, the intervention consists of only 24 lessons. There is no mention of a
      follow-up period extending to a full academic year (approx. 9-10 months). The
      assessments were administered "following the curriculum."

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is not met because the study duration
      was limited to the implementation of 24 lessons and did not span a full academic year.
    explanation: The study tracked outcomes only until the end of the 24-lesson curriculum,
      not for a full academic year.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Schools in the control condition participated in their daily
      activities, with teachers receiving only their standard professional
      development and teaching their standard curriculum. This did not include a
      standardized CS program..." (p. 8)

      2) "Before teaching the CAL-ScratchJr curriculum, teachers received six
      sessions of an hour-long professional development..." (p. 8)

      3) "The CAL-ScratchJr curriculum was implemented at the classroom level
      either by the classroom teacher or by an enrichment teacher who received
      prior training." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires the control group to receive balanced resources
      (time/budget) unless the extra resources are the explicit variable being
      tested. The treatment group received a specific new curriculum, 6 hours of
      professional development, and support from enrichment teachers. The control
      group received "only their standard professional development" and
      "participated in their daily activities." There was no compensatory time,
      attention, or alternative intervention provided to the control group to
      balance the additional resources and training given to the treatment group.
      The study measures the efficacy of the curriculum itself, but the lack of
      resource balance means the effects could be attributed to the extra training
      and attention.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is not met because the treatment group
      received additional professional development and resources that were not matched
      in the control group.
    explanation: The control group did not receive resources, time, or professional
      development equivalent to the treatment group.

      "The curricula have been implemented and evaluated... (Bers, Blake-West, et
      al., 2023, Yang et al., 2023)."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The curricula have been implemented and evaluated in the United States
      as part of a pilot program and a multi-state cluster-randomized control
      trial (Bers, Blake-West, et al., 2023, Yang et al., 2023)." (p. 5)

      2) "This is the first paper to evaluate the CAL-ScratchJr curriculum and
      pedagogy outside of the United States..." (p. 16)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires independent replication by a different research
      team. The previous studies cited (Bers et al., Yang et al.) involve the
      same primary author (Bers) and research group (DevTech). There is no
      evidence provided of an independent replication by a completely different
      research team in a peer-reviewed journal.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is not met because all cited previous
      evaluations were conducted by the same research group, not independent teams.
    explanation: Previous evaluations were conducted by the same authors/research
      group; no independent replication is cited.

      (CSA)" (p. 10)

      2) "The TechCheck assessments evaluated computational thinking..." (p. 10)

      3) "Students... completed pre-curriculum assessments of coding knowledge
      and computational thinking." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires measuring impact on all main subjects taught in
      school. This study only assessed "coding knowledge" and "computational
      thinking." It did not assess impact on math, reading, science, or other
      core subjects. Additionally, since Criterion E (Exam-based Assessment) was
      not met, this criterion is automatically not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because the study only
      assessed specific domain knowledge (coding/CT) and did not utilize standardized
      exams for all main school subjects.
    explanation: The study limited assessment to coding and computational thinking,
      ignoring other core subjects.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Finally, following the curriculum... students completed post-curriculum
      assessments." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires tracking participants until graduation. The study
      collected data only immediately following the curriculum intervention. There
      is no mention of long-term tracking or follow-up until graduation in this
      paper or in subsequent papers by the same authors (as the study is from 2025
      and participants are in K-2).

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is not met because there was no
      long-term follow-up or tracking of students until graduation.
    explanation: Tracking ended immediately after the curriculum implementation.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study was approved by [AUTHORS' INSTITUTIONAL IRB] under protocol
      code [#########]." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires a pre-registered protocol (e.g., on OSF or
      ClinicalTrials.gov) before data collection begins. The paper mentions IRB
      approval, which is an ethical requirement, but does not cite a public
      pre-registration of the study design and hypotheses on a registry platform.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is not met because there is no evidence
      of a public pre-registered protocol.
    explanation: The paper mentions IRB approval but does not cite a public pre-registration
      of the study protocol.
