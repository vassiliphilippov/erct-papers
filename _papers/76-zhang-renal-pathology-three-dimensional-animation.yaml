  Objectives Teaching renal pathology, characterized by complex spatial
  relationships and dynamic pathological processes, poses significant
  challenges. Traditional methods such as static slides often fail to
  convey these concepts effectively. This study evaluated the efficacy of
  custom-developed renal pathology three-dimensional (3D) animations in
  enhancing learning outcomes and satisfaction during students' internal
  medicine clerkships in nephrology. Methods A randomized controlled
  trial was conducted. 93 students undertaking nephrology clerkships were
  randomly assigned 1:1 to either a conventional teaching group or a 3D
  animation group (intervention group). The intervention group utilized
  specifically developed 3D animations depicting renal microstructure and
  the dynamic progression of common pathologies. Teaching effectiveness
  was assessed via pre- and post-teaching written examinations. Student
  and faculty satisfaction with the 3D animations was evaluated using
  5-point scale questionnaires. Results Baseline knowledge scores were
  comparable between groups. Post-teaching scores were significantly
  higher in the 3D animation group, representing a greater score
  improvement (34.5±34.8 vs 19.1±32.4, p=0.03). Over 95% of students in 3D
  animation group rated the 3D animations superior to traditional slides
  for vividness and conceptual understanding, 89% reported increased
  learning initiative and outcomes. Faculty unanimously agreed animations
  improved structural explanation clarity and student attentiveness.
  Conclusions Incorporating 3D renal pathology animations significantly
  improved knowledge acquisition and achieved exceptionally high
  satisfaction among students and faculty during internal medicine
  clerkships.

criteria:
  c:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization was at the individual student level (not class or
      school), so class-level randomization to reduce contamination is
      not demonstrated.
    quote: >-
      "students were first randomly assigned using a random number table
      to either the conventional teaching group or the 3D animation group
      in a 1:1 ratio" (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "93 students undertaking nephrology clerkships were randomly
      assigned 1:1 to either a conventional teaching group or a 3D
      animation group (intervention group)." (p. 2)

      2) "students were first randomly assigned using a random number
      table to either the conventional teaching group or the 3D animation
      group in a 1:1 ratio" (p. 7)

      3) "Within each program, both the traditional teaching group and
      the 3D animation group received instruction from the same instructor
      on the same day, with sessions held consecutively and separated by a
      few minutes." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomization at the class level (or stronger)
      to reduce contamination across students who share the same learning
      environment. In this study, the unit of randomization is explicitly
      "students" (individual-level assignment), not intact classes,
      clerkship groups, or sites.

      The consecutive same-day delivery by the same instructor to both
      groups further highlights a plausible contamination pathway (students
      in the same rotation environment can share information), which is
      exactly what class-level (or site-level) randomization is meant to
      mitigate.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is not met because randomization was
      conducted at the individual student level rather than at the class
      (or school/site) level.

  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured using locally developed Test A/Test B
      examinations rather than a widely recognized standardized exam.
    quote: >-
      "Two examination sets (Test A and Test B) of comparable difficulty,
      developed by senior nephrology faculty and renal pathologists..."
      (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Teaching effectiveness was assessed via pre- and post-teaching
      written examinations." (p. 2)

      2) "Two examination sets (Test A and Test B) of comparable
      difficulty, developed by senior nephrology faculty and renal
      pathologists, were uniformly administered as pre- and
      post-intervention assessments to all participants across teaching
      groups and academic programs." (p. 7)

      3) "Each examination was administered in a multiple-choice format
      consisting of 20 items, with a maximum attainable score of 100
      points." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires a standardized, widely recognized exam-based
      assessment (e.g., national/state standardized tests), not an
      instrument created for the study.

      The paper states that Test A/Test B were "developed by senior
      nephrology faculty and renal pathologists" and provides formatting
      details, but does not identify the exams as externally standardized
      or widely used beyond this study.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because the outcome measures
      were locally developed examinations rather than standardized exams.

  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention and measurement occurred within a 2-week rotation
      with immediate post-teaching testing, which is shorter than a full
      academic term.
    quote: >-
      "Both groups underwent a teaching effectiveness evaluation
      immediately following the session." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "the renal pathology 3D animations were directly integrated into
      targeted explanations of relevant topics throughout the standardized
      2-week clerkship rotation period." (p. 6)

      2) "Both groups underwent a teaching effectiveness evaluation
      immediately following the session." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcomes to be measured at least one academic
      term after the intervention begins (or at least term-long follow-up
      after a short intervention).

      Here, the instructional period is a "standardized 2-week clerkship
      rotation period," and the evaluation was conducted "immediately
      following the session." The paper does not describe any delayed
      (term-later) follow-up measurement.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is not met because outcomes were assessed
      immediately after teaching within a 2-week rotation rather than at
      least one term after intervention start.

  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control condition and baseline characteristics (including group
      sizes and demographics) are described with pre-test scores.
    quote: >-
      "These students were allocated to the conventional teaching group
      (n=47) ... and the 3D animation group (n=46)..." (p. 9)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Conventional teaching group received instruction using
      traditional PowerPoint slides, including schematic diagrams and
      histopathological images, to explain renal microstructure and various
      pathological features." (p. 7)

      2) "These students were allocated to the conventional teaching group
      (n=47), consisting of 28 clinical medicine and 19 stomatology
      students, and the 3D animation group (n=46), with 27 clinical medicine
      and 19 stomatology students." (p. 9)

      3) "The group comprised 51 males and 42 females, with no significant
      difference in gender distribution between groups (59% male vs. 51%
      male, p=0.46)." (p. 9)

      4) "pre-teaching assessment revealed comparable baseline performance
      between the two student groups (48.3±35.8 vs 50.1±35.3, p=0.08)."
      (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control group be clearly documented,
      including what it received and baseline characteristics to support
      comparability.

      The paper specifies the control instruction method (traditional
      PowerPoint slides), reports group sizes (including program breakdown),
      provides demographics (gender, age comparison), and reports baseline
      pre-test performance.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the control condition and
      baseline comparability information are clearly documented.

  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Schools (or clerkship sites) were not randomized; students were
      individually assigned, so school-level randomization is absent.
    quote: >-
      "students were first randomly assigned ... to either the conventional
      teaching group or the 3D animation group" (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "93 students undertaking nephrology clerkships were randomly
      assigned 1:1 to either a conventional teaching group or a 3D
      animation group (intervention group)." (p. 2)

      2) "students were first randomly assigned using a random number table
      to either the conventional teaching group or the 3D animation group
      in a 1:1 ratio" (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the school (or equivalent
      implementation unit, such as clerkship sites/centers) level.

      The paper describes individual student assignment and does not
      describe randomization of sites, departments, or schools.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met because randomization was not
      conducted at the school/site level.

  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The research team developed the animations and also collected and
      analyzed the data, with no clearly independent evaluator.
    quote: >-
      "Faculty members on the research team first referred to the syllabus
      and teaching objectives." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Faculty members on the research team first referred to the
      syllabus and teaching objectives." (p. 5)

      2) "The questionnaires were designed by the researchers based on a
      review of relevant literature." (p. 7)

      3) "QZ, YXX, SM and WJW completed the informed consent procedures,
      conducted the questionnaires, and collected the data. QZ and WJW
      analyzed the data." (p. 14)

      4) "The realism and accuracy of the 3D animations were independently
      reviewed and validated by a multidisciplinary panel comprising the
      teaching director, teaching supervisors, course instructors, and
      renal pathology specialists." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the evaluation be conducted independently
      from the intervention designers.

      The paper indicates the research team developed the 3D animations and
      that members of the author team designed the questionnaires, collected
      data, and analyzed the data. The "independently reviewed" panel is
      described as validating the realism/accuracy of animations, not as an
      independent trial evaluation or analysis team.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because the intervention
      developers/authors also conducted key evaluation steps without a
      clearly independent evaluator.

  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention and outcome measurement occurred over a 2-week
      rotation with immediate post-testing, far below 75% of an academic
      year.
    quote: >-
      "the standardized 2-week clerkship rotation period." (p. 6)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Undergraduate students completing clerkships in the nephrology
      department between August 2025 and October 2025 were enrolled."
      (p. 4)

      2) "the renal pathology 3D animations were directly integrated into
      targeted explanations of relevant topics throughout the standardized
      2-week clerkship rotation period." (p. 6)

      3) "Both groups underwent a teaching effectiveness evaluation
      immediately following the session." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least 75% of an academic
      year after the intervention begins.

      While enrollment occurred across multiple months (August 2025 to
      October 2025) across cohorts, each participant experienced a 2-week
      rotation and was tested immediately after the session, which is far
      shorter than the required year-duration tracking.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because outcomes were measured
      immediately after a 2-week rotation, not over most of an academic year.

  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Instructional objectives and in-session teaching time appear matched
      across groups; the only extra resource (post-session online access)
      occurred after the immediate post-test, making any resource
      imbalance negligible for the main outcome.
    quote: >-
      "This plan ensured that the core learning objectives and key knowledge
      points were identical across both instructional methods." (p. 6)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This plan ensured that the core learning objectives and key
      knowledge points were identical across both instructional methods."
      (p. 6)

      2) "Within each program, both the traditional teaching group and the
      3D animation group received instruction from the same instructor on
      the same day, with sessions held consecutively and separated by a few
      minutes." (p. 6)

      3) "Both groups underwent a teaching effectiveness evaluation
      immediately following the session." (p. 7)

      4) "Students in the 3D animation group were subsequently provided with
      an online link to access the animations for self-directed review."
      (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B requires that time/resources be balanced between groups,
      unless the extra resources are explicitly the treatment variable.

      The paper indicates a standardized plan with identical objectives and
      key points across both methods, and the same instructor taught both
      groups on the same day. The only clear additional resource is that
      the 3D animation group received an online link for review.

      However, the primary learning outcome (post-teaching written exam) was
      administered "immediately following the session," before students
      could plausibly benefit from later self-directed review access.
      Therefore, for the main measured outcome, the resource difference is
      negligible.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is met because in-session instruction was
      standardized across groups and the only additional resource was
      provided after the immediate post-test.

  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication study is reported or identifiable as a
      direct replication of this specific RCT.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      (No quotes in the paper indicate an independent replication of this
      specific RCT.)

      External Search (replication by other authors):

      No peer-reviewed replication publications explicitly replicating this
      specific study were identified in publicly accessible sources at the
      time of this ERCT check.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication by a different team,
      in a different context, published in a peer-reviewed venue.

      The paper presents a single-site RCT and does not mention any prior or
      subsequent independent replication. Given the paper's very recent
      publication timing, and the lack of identified replication reports,
      this criterion cannot be marked as met.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because there is no quoted or
      independently verifiable evidence of replication by another research
      team.

  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Because standardized exams are not used (criterion E not met), the
      all-subject standardized exam requirement cannot be met.
    quote: >-
      "Exam content, based on the syllabus and clinical diagnostic or
      therapeutic needs, covered renal pathology and related nephrology
      knowledge." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Two examination sets (Test A and Test B) of comparable difficulty,
      developed by senior nephrology faculty and renal pathologists..."
      (p. 7)

      2) "Exam content, based on the syllabus and clinical diagnostic or
      therapeutic needs, covered renal pathology and related nephrology
      knowledge." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires all-subject outcomes measured with standardized
      exam-based assessments, and ERCT rules state that if criterion E is not
      met, criterion A is not met.

      Here, the assessments are faculty-developed Test A/Test B (so E is not
      met). In addition, the described content is renal pathology/nephrology,
      not all core subjects for the relevant educational program.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because criterion E is not met
      and the assessments are not standardized all-subject exams.

  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not track participants to graduation and explicitly
      notes the lack of long-term follow-up; additionally, ERCT rules
      require criterion Y to be met for criterion G to be met.
    quote: >-
      "The lack of long-term follow-up to evaluate knowledge retention and
      the enduring impact of the animations represents a significant
      limitation." (p. 12)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Both groups underwent a teaching effectiveness evaluation
      immediately following the session." (p. 7)

      2) "The lack of long-term follow-up to evaluate knowledge retention
      and the enduring impact of the animations represents a significant
      limitation." (p. 12)

      External Search (follow-up papers by the same authors):

      No subsequent peer-reviewed follow-up publication by the same author
      team was identified that tracks this cohort to a graduation milestone.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation from the
      relevant educational stage. The paper documents only immediate
      post-session testing and explicitly identifies the lack of long-term
      follow-up as a limitation.

      Additionally, ERCT rules state that if criterion Y (year duration) is
      not met, then criterion G cannot be met. Since this study does not
      meet criterion Y, criterion G must remain not met even before
      considering graduation endpoints.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because the study did not
      include long-term follow-up through graduation and criterion Y is not
      met.

  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The trial registration is explicitly described as retrospective and
      dated after enrollment, so it was not pre-registered before data
      collection began.

      2025-11-18, retrospective registration)." (p. 7)

      3) "Undergraduate students completing clerkships in the nephrology
      department between August 2025 and October 2025 were enrolled."
      (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires a publicly available pre-registered protocol
      dated before data collection begins.

      The paper explicitly labels the registration as "retrospective
      registration" with a date of 2025-11-18. The enrollment period is
      August 2025 to October 2025, which is earlier than 2025-11-18.

      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met because the study was registered
      retrospectively after enrollment/data collection had already occurred.
