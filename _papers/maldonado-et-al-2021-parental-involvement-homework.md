  This paper provides causal evidence on parental involvement in a financial
  education course. Two randomised controlled trials were conducted with 2779
  students (grade 8 and 9) in Flanders, assigning schools to three treatment
  variants and one control group. Although the combined classroom intervention
  and homework showed positive effects on financial literacy, adding a prompt
  for parental involvement did not significantly increase learning gains on
  average. However, disadvantaged students benefited more from the parental
  involvement prompt in behavioral items. The study is registered in the AEA
  RCT Registry (AEARCTR-0003481).

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: "They randomized at the school level, stronger than class-level."
    quote: "“Randomisation was done at school level … 116 schools registered … assigned in four experimental groups…” (pp. 6–7)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion C requires randomisation at the class level or stronger. The paper
      explicitly states that randomization occurred at the school level: “Randomisation
      was done at school level to avoid contamination at class or teacher level.”
      Since randomizing entire schools is stronger, the study meets Criterion C.

  e:
    met: false
    explanation: "They used a custom instrument, not a standardized exam."
    quote: "“The pretest ... was composed of items specifically covering the topics of the intervention ... attitudes.” (p. 10)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion E requires an externally developed, standardized exam-based
      assessment. This study used custom instruments designed specifically for
      measuring intervention outcomes, thus not meeting Criterion E.

  t:
    met: false
    explanation: "The intervention lasted only a few weeks, less than a term."
    quote: "“Classes in grade 8 participated between February and mid-April 2018, ... four class periods.” (pp. 8–9)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion T requires at least one full academic term duration (3–4 months).
      The intervention consisted of four class periods over a few weeks, failing
      to meet Criterion T.

  d:
    met: true
    explanation: "Thorough baseline demographics and scores provided for control."
    quote: "“Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics and test scores ... 850 students in control.” (pp. 12–13)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion D requires detailed baseline data for the control group. This study
      clearly provided demographics and performance data, thus meeting Criterion D.

  s:
    met: true
    explanation: "Randomized at school-level, clearly fulfilling the criterion."
    quote: "“Randomisation was done at school level ... Registered schools were randomised...” (p. 7)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion S requires school-level randomization. The study clearly randomized
      entire schools, unequivocally satisfying Criterion S.

  a:
    met: false
    explanation: "Measured financial literacy only, not all core subjects."
    quote: "“Financial literacy was assessed on nine multiple choice questions … measuring knowledge.” (p. 10)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion A requires standardized testing of all core subjects. The study
      only measured financial literacy outcomes, not meeting Criterion A.

  y:
    met: false
    explanation: "Intervention spanned weeks, not a full academic year."
    quote: "“...four class periods ... implemented between February and June 2018.” (pp. 8–9)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion Y requires a full-year intervention. The intervention lasted only
      a few weeks, thus not meeting Criterion Y.

  b:
    met: false
    explanation: "No equivalent resources provided to the control group."
    quote: "“Control received post-test six weeks after pretest ... teaching material after experiment.” (p. 9)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion B requires balanced extra resources for control and treatment
      groups. The control received no equivalent resource/time, not meeting Criterion B.

  g:
    met: false
    explanation: "Short-term post-tests only, no graduation tracking."
    quote: "“Students completed a post-test at the end ... second post-test, seven weeks later.” (p. 9)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion G requires graduation tracking. The study only measured immediate
      outcomes, thus failing Criterion G.

  r:
    met: false
    explanation: "Two waves under the same team, no independent replication."
    quote: "“The intervention was implemented in two waves to increase external validity.” (pp. 8–9)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion R requires independent replication by external researchers. The
      study was conducted by the same research team, not meeting Criterion R.

  i:
    met: false
    explanation: "Study run by the intervention designers, not externally independent."
    quote: "“Assignment created by senior teachers in project team.” (p. 8)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion I requires external independence from designers. The same team
      developed materials and managed the study, not meeting Criterion I.

  p:
    met: true
    explanation: "Study pre-registered in AEA RCT Registry (AEARCTR-0003481)."
    quote: "“This study is registered in AEA RCT Registry under AEARCTR-0003481.” (p. 2)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion P requires pre-registration. The study explicitly reported
      registration in the AEA RCT Registry, thus clearly meeting Criterion P.
