  Background: Cancer cases are increasing every day, which makes
  oncology nursing education very important. Nursing students need
  to learn how to manage the many symptoms caused by cancer and its
  treatments. This study aimed to examine the effect of a cooperative
  learning approach with concept maps on nursing students' knowledge
  acquisition on symptom management in cancer patients. Methods: This
  study was a pre-test post-test open-label, randomized controlled
  design. The study sample consisted of 90 second-year nursing
  students randomized into experimental (n=45) and control (n=45)
  groups. Symptom management training was implemented with the
  experimental group students using a cooperative learning approach
  with concept maps. Standard training was maintained with the
  control group students. The study data were collected using the
  "Personal Information Form", "Knowledge Test on Symptom Management
  in Cancer Patients", and "Self-Directed Learning Scale". Results:
  According to repeated-measures ANCOVA analyses adjusted for
  baseline scores, a significant time effect was observed in the
  intervention group (F = 13.24, p = 0.001). After adjustment, the
  intervention group achieved higher adjusted post-test and follow-up
  knowledge scores compared with the control group. In addition,
  ANCOVA results for self-directed learning ability demonstrated a
  strong group effect on post-test scores (F(1,87) = 97.75,
  p < 0.001, partial η² = 0.529), with higher adjusted mean scores in
  the intervention group. Conclusions: This study concluded that the
  cooperative learning approach using concept mapping for symptom
  management in cancer patients is effective in increasing nursing
  students' knowledge levels and knowledge retention, as well as in
  developing self-directed learning.

criteria:
  c:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Students (not whole classes or schools) were randomized, so the unit of
      randomization was below the class level and risks contamination.
    quote: >-
      "Students who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the
      intervention and control groups using simple randomization based on
      computer-generated random numbers." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This randomized controlled trial with a pretest-posttest design was
      planned to examine the effect of the cooperative learning approach using
      concept maps on nursing students' knowledge acquisition and self-directed
      learning regarding symptom management in cancer patients." (p. 4)

      2) "Students who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the
      intervention and control groups using simple randomization based on
      computer-generated random numbers." (p. 5)

      3) "To further ensure the integrity of the intervention and comparability
      between groups, the intervention and control sessions were conducted
      separately and at different times." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomization at the class level (or stronger), unless
      the intervention is explicitly one-to-one tutoring/personal teaching. The
      paper states that individual students were randomly assigned to
      intervention and control groups using computer-generated random numbers.
      It does not state that intact classes (or schools/sites) were randomized.

      The authors note scheduling and anti-contamination measures, but these do
      not change the unit of randomization. Because student-level randomization
      is below the class level and the intervention is not described as
      one-to-one tutoring, the ERCT class-level RCT requirement is not met.

      This criterion is not met because randomization was at the student level,
      not at the class (or school) level.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The primary educational outcome used a researcher-developed knowledge test
      rather than a widely recognized standardized exam.
    quote: >-
      "This test developed by the researchers according to the literature was
      created in two stages (16,17)." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study data were collected using the "Personal Information Form",
      the "Knowledge Test on Symptom Management in Cancer Patients", and the
      "Self-Directed Learning Scale"." (p. 5)

      2) "This test developed by the researchers according to the literature was
      created in two stages (16,17)." (p. 5)

      3) "In the first stage, 20 questions were created by the researchers based
      on the expected course outcomes related to the oncological symptoms
      covered in the internal medicine nursing course and the resources used in
      the course." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires a standardized exam-based assessment (i.e., a widely
      recognized external exam, not created for this particular study). The
      paper’s primary knowledge outcome is measured by a "Knowledge Test on
      Symptom Management in Cancer Patients" that was created by the
      researchers, based on course outcomes, and then evaluated for content
      validity and reliability.

      While these psychometric steps support internal quality, the instrument is
      still a researcher-developed test rather than a standardized, externally
      administered exam used broadly beyond this study context. The
      Self-Directed Learning Scale is not an exam-based achievement measure and
      does not satisfy the exam-based requirement for academic outcomes.

      This criterion is not met because the study uses a researcher-developed
      knowledge test rather than a standardized exam.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were assessed after a short intervention with only a 4-week
      follow-up, and the stated study period spans far less than an academic
      term.
    quote: >-
      "To measure the retention of knowledge, the same test was administered
      again 4 weeks after the post-test." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The research was carried out between 11.25.2024 and 01.03.2025 in the
      nursing department of the faculty of health sciences of a university."
      (p. 4)

      2) "A three-session plan was implemented with the experimental group
      students." (p. 6)

      3) "To measure the retention of knowledge, the same test was administered
      again 4 weeks after the post-test." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that outcomes be measured at least one full academic
      term (typically about 3–4 months) after the intervention begins. The paper
      describes a three-session intervention and a follow-up assessment "4 weeks
      after the post-test."

      The reported overall study window is "between 11.25.2024 and 01.03.2025".
      Interpreting these as month.day.year dates (as written), this spans from
      November 25, 2024 to January 3, 2025 (about 5–6 weeks), which is shorter
      than a full academic term. The last described follow-up point is only four
      weeks after post-test, reinforcing the short time horizon.

      This criterion is not met because the study’s follow-up period is far
      shorter than a full academic term.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control condition is clearly described (standard instruction), and
      baseline demographic comparability between groups is documented.
    quote: >-
      "The control group students received standard instruction (four hours of
      theoretical training on symptom management in cancer patients)." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The control group students received standard instruction (four hours
      of theoretical training on symptom management in cancer patients)."
      (p. 7)

      2) "Students were not given any additional resources for preparation or
      practice." (p. 7)

      3) "There was no statistically significant relationship between the
      experimental and control groups when the distribution of age (p=0.341),
      gender (p=0.063), marital status (p=0.240), history of chronic disease
      (p=1.000), and family history of oncological disease (p=0.667) was compared
      (Table 1)." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires a well-documented control group, including what the
      control group received and baseline information enabling comparison. The
      paper specifies the control condition as standard instruction with four
      hours of theoretical training and explicitly notes that control students
      were not given additional preparation/practice resources during the study.

      The paper also provides baseline demographic comparisons (Table 1 and its
      narrative) indicating no statistically significant differences between
      groups on several listed characteristics. This is sufficient to understand
      the control condition and baseline comparability.

      This criterion is met because the control condition and baseline group
      characteristics are clearly documented.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization occurred at the student level within one university program,
      not by random assignment of schools or sites.
    quote: >-
      "Students who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the
      intervention and control groups using simple randomization based on
      computer-generated random numbers." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The research was carried out between 11.25.2024 and 01.03.2025 in the
      nursing department of the faculty of health sciences of a university."
      (p. 4)

      2) "Students who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the
      intervention and control groups using simple randomization based on
      computer-generated random numbers." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level (institution/site-level) randomization.
      The study was conducted within a single university department and
      explicitly states that students were randomized. There is no indication
      that multiple schools, sites, or equivalent institutions were randomized.

      This criterion is not met because randomization was not performed at the
      school (site) level.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not report an independent third-party evaluation; key study
      elements were developed and analyzed by the author team.
    quote: >-
      "Author’s contributions Conceptualization: B.B.K., Methodology: B.B.K,

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This test developed by the researchers according to the literature was
      created in two stages (16,17)." (p. 5)

      2) "Researchers created six concept maps based on the literature and
      course outcomes (16,17)." (p. 6)

      3) "Author’s contributions Conceptualization: B.B.K., Methodology: B.B.K,
      A.A., Validation: A.A. B.B.K., Formal analysis: A.A. B.B.K, Investigation:

      S.B, Writing - original draft: A.A., B.B.K, Writing - review & editing:
      A.A. B.B.K." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires evidence that the study was conducted independently
      from the intervention designers/authors (e.g., external evaluators,
      independent data collection/analysis teams). The paper describes that the
      researchers developed key study materials (the knowledge test and concept
      maps). The author contribution statement indicates the author team
      performed core study functions, including methodology, formal analysis,
      and investigation.

      The paper does not include a statement indicating that an independent
      third party conducted implementation, data collection, or analysis.

      This criterion is not met because independent conduct by a third party is
      not demonstrated.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study duration and follow-up are far shorter than 75% of an academic
      year, and ERCT rules also imply Y is not met when T is not met.
    quote: >-
      "The research was carried out between 11.25.2024 and 01.03.2025 ..." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The research was carried out between 11.25.2024 and 01.03.2025 in the
      nursing department of the faculty of health sciences of a university."
      (p. 4)

      2) "To measure the retention of knowledge, the same test was administered
      again 4 weeks after the post-test." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcomes measured at least 75% of an academic year
      after the intervention begins. The reported study period is only several
      weeks (late November 2024 to early January 2025), and the final outcome
      assessment described is a four-week follow-up after post-test. This is
      substantially shorter than an academic year.

      Additionally, ERCT rules specify that if criterion T is not met, then
      criterion Y is not met. Since T is not met for this paper, Y is also not
      met.

      This criterion is not met because the study does not track outcomes for a
      year-like duration (and T is not met).
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The paper reports equal instructional session duration across groups, and
      the main resource difference (concept maps/cooperative structure) is the
      intervention being tested rather than an unmatched time or budget boost.
    quote: >-
      "The duration allocated for the educational sessions was equal across
      groups." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A three-session plan was implemented with the experimental group
      students." (p. 6)

      2) "Each group was given a concept map prepared under the relevant
      heading." (p. 7)

      3) "In the first session, each group member was asked to make individual
      preparations within the topics and concept map." (p. 7)

      4) "The control group students received standard instruction (four hours
      of theoretical training on symptom management in cancer patients)." (p. 7)

      5) "Students were not given any additional resources for preparation or
      practice." (p. 7)

      6) "The training content was standardized using a structured presentation,
      and the same topic content was provided to both the experimental and
      control groups." (p. 7)

      7) "The duration allocated for the educational sessions was equal across
      groups." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B evaluates whether the intervention group received additional
      time/budget/resources not matched in the control group, unless those
      additional resources are explicitly integral to what is being tested.

      The paper explicitly states that "The duration allocated for the
      educational sessions was equal across groups" and that content was
      standardized, which supports time balance during scheduled sessions.

      The experimental group used concept maps and cooperative learning. The
      control group received standard instruction and was not given additional
      preparation/practice resources. The experimental group was asked to make
      individual preparations in the first session; this likely implies
      additional student effort outside the cooperative sessions. However, that
      preparation appears to be a core component of the cooperative learning
      approach as implemented (i.e., integral to the treatment definition),
      rather than an optional add-on like extra tutoring hours or extra
      funded support. The paper does not describe additional paid staffing,
      extra class hours, or additional budget exclusive to the intervention.

      This criterion is met because scheduled instructional time is explicitly
      equal across groups and the primary resource difference is integral to
      the pedagogical intervention being tested.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication by a different research team was found for this
      specific study/intervention as of the ERCT check date.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      (No relevant quotes about independent replication were found in the paper.)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires evidence that a different research team independently
      replicated this specific study (or a clearly equivalent intervention and
      evaluation) in a different context, published in a peer-reviewed journal.

      The paper itself does not describe being a replication, and it does not
      cite any external replication of this exact study. An internet search was
      conducted (including queries by DOI, title, and NCT ID) to identify
      independent replication studies by other authors, and no such peer-
      reviewed replication publications were found.

      This criterion is not met because independent replication evidence for
      this specific study was not identified.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not use standardized exams across all core subjects, and
      because E is not met, A is not met as well.
    quote: >-
      "The study data were collected using the "Personal Information Form", the
      "Knowledge Test on Symptom Management in Cancer Patients", and the

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study data were collected using the "Personal Information Form",
      the "Knowledge Test on Symptom Management in Cancer Patients", and the
      "Self-Directed Learning Scale"." (p. 5)

      2) "This test developed by the researchers according to the literature was
      created in two stages (16,17)." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all main
      subjects, and ERCT rules specify that if criterion E is not met then
      criterion A is not met. The study’s assessments include a researcher-
      developed knowledge test focused on symptom management and a self-directed
      learning scale; these are not standardized exams across a broad set of
      core subjects.

      This criterion is not met because standardized all-subject exams are not
      used and criterion E is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not track participants until graduation, and because Y is
      not met, G is not met as well.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To measure the retention of knowledge, the same test was administered
      again 4 weeks after the post-test." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation from the
      relevant educational stage. The paper reports only post-test assessment
      and a single follow-up "4 weeks after the post-test," with no mention of
      graduation outcomes or long-term follow-up.

      Per ERCT rules, if criterion Y is not met then criterion G is not met. Y
      is not met for this study, so G cannot be met.

      An internet search was also conducted for follow-up publications by the
      same authors on this cohort (using the paper title, DOI, author names,
      and the NCT identifier), and no graduation-tracking follow-up papers were
      identified.

      This criterion is not met because there is no graduation tracking (and Y
      is not met).
  p:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Trial registration information indicates the study was registered on
      ClinicalTrials.gov before the study start date.
    quote: >-
      "Study Start (Actual) November 15, 2024" (ClinicalTrials.gov record as

      2) "Trial Registration The study was prospectively registered at
      ClinicalTrials.gov prior to participant recruitment. The registration
      number is NCT06695702." (p. 13)

      mirrored by ICHGCP)

      5) "First Posted (Actual) November 19, 2024" (ClinicalTrials.gov record as
      mirrored by ICHGCP)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the protocol be pre-registered before the study
      begins (before data collection/participant recruitment). The paper
      provides a ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT06695702) and explicitly
      states that registration was prospective and occurred prior to recruitment.
      It also provides a registration date (November 11, 2024).

      The ClinicalTrials.gov record (accessed via the ICHGCP mirror, which
      states it retrieves information from ClinicalTrials.gov) lists "First
      Submitted November 14, 2024" and "Study Start (Actual) November 15, 2024",
      indicating the record was submitted before the study start date.

      This criterion is met because registry dates indicate registration
      occurred before the recorded study start date.
