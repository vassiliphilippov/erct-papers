abstract: >-
  Tutoring programs for low-performing students, delivered in-person or
  online, effectively enhance school performance, yet their medium- and
  longer-term impacts on labor market outcomes remain less understood. To
  address this gap, we conduct a randomized controlled trial with 839
  secondary school students in Germany to examine the effects of an online
  tutoring program for low-performing students on academic performance and
  school-to-work transitions. The online tutoring program had a
  non-significant intention-to-treat effect of 0.06 standard deviations on
  math grades six months after program start. However, among students who
  had not received other tutoring services prior to the intervention, the
  program significantly improved math grades by 0.14 standard deviations.
  Moreover, students in non-academic school tracks experienced smoother
  school-to-work transitions, with vocational training take-up 18 months
  later being 5 percentage points higher-an effect that was even larger
  (12 percentage points) among those without prior tutoring. Overall, the
  results indicate that tutoring can generate lasting benefits for
  low-performing students that extend beyond school performance.

    explanation: Student-level random assignment is clearly described.

      The students were then pair-wise randomly assigned to either a
      treatment or a control group.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To analyze the effectiveness of the Lern-Fair online tutoring
      program, we conducted a randomized field experiment." (p. 14)

      2) "The students were then pair-wise randomly assigned to either a
      treatment or a control group." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper describes a randomized field experiment in which eligible
      students enter a randomization process and are assigned to treatment
      (online tutoring invitation) or control. This is an individual-level
      randomization within an education context, which matches the intent of
      criterion C (testing below the school level to reduce contamination and
      allow a clean comparison).

      Final: Criterion C is met because students are randomly assigned to
      treatment or control.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes rely on self-reported grades rather than standardized exams.
    quote: >-
      All grades are self-reported by the young participants and relate to
      the final grades from school years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023,
      respectively.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "All grades are self-reported by the young participants and relate to
      the final grades from school years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023,
      respectively." (p. 25)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The main academic outcome is based on students' reported school grades,
      not standardized test or external exam scores. The ERCT criterion E
      requires exam-based (standardized) assessment so outcomes are objective
      and comparable across students and settings. Self-reported grades do not
      satisfy that requirement.

      Final: Criterion E is not met because outcomes are based on self-reported
      grades, not exams.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Follow-up measurement occurs after a substantial interval post-
      intervention start.
    quote: >-
      The first survey (follow-up I) took place in October and Novem- ber
      2022, during the new school year, after the treatment group had been
      invited to participate in Lern-Fair.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In response to our invitation to participate in the online tutoring
      program, 30% of the students did in fact take part, usually attending
      weekly sessions for more than three months." (p. 6)

      2) "The first survey (follow-up I) took place in October and Novem- ber
      2022, during the new school year, after the treatment group had been
      invited to participate in Lern-Fair." (p. 17)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention is an online tutoring offer that (for participants)
      typically runs for more than three months with weekly sessions. Outcome
      measurement is not immediate: the first follow-up survey occurs in
      October-November 2022 after students were invited to participate in the
      program, and the intervention period is described as spanning multiple
      months. This satisfies the "at least one term after intervention begins"
      requirement in the ERCT specification.

      Final: Criterion T is met because outcomes are measured after a
      substantial post-start interval.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Treatment and control conditions are clearly described and baseline
      balance is shown.
    quote: >-
      Students assigned to the treatment group received an invitation to
      participate in the Lern-Fair online tutoring program.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students assigned to the treatment group received an invitation to
      participate in the Lern-Fair online tutoring program." (p. 14)

      2) "Table 1 indicates that student characteristics were balanced between
      the treatment and the control group at baseline." (p. 17)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper clearly defines the treatment condition as receiving an
      invitation to join the Lern-Fair online tutoring program. It also
      reports baseline balance between treatment and control groups (Table 1),
      indicating that the control group is well-characterized and comparable at
      baseline. This level of documentation is sufficient for criterion D,
      which requires a clearly described and analyzable control condition.

      Final: Criterion D is met because the control condition is clearly
      defined and baseline balance is documented.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: Randomization is not conducted at the school level.
    quote: >-
      The students were then pair-wise randomly assigned to either a treatment
      or a control group.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The students were then pair-wise randomly assigned to either a
      treatment or a control group." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the school level. Here, the
      randomization occurs at the student level (pair-wise assignment of
      students). While students and schools are geographically dispersed, the
      unit of randomization is not the school, so criterion S is not satisfied.

      Final: Criterion S is not met because randomization is not at the school
      level.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: Key outcomes are self-reported, not independently assessed.
    quote: >-
      All grades are self-reported by the young participants and relate to the
      final grades from school years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023, respectively.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "All grades are self-reported by the young participants and relate to
      the final grades from school years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023,
      respectively." (p. 25)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires outcomes to be assessed by third-party or
      independent evaluators to reduce bias. The key outcome measures rely on
      student self-reports of grades (and survey-based outcomes more
      generally). Self-reported outcome measurement does not meet the intent of
      independent evaluation.

      Final: Criterion I is not met because key outcomes are self-reported
      rather than independently assessed.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes span more than one academic year, including a second follow-up
      in late 2023.
    quote: The second survey (follow-up II) took place in November and December 2023.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The second survey (follow-up II) took place in November and December
      2023." (p. 17)

      2) "All grades are self-reported by the young participants and relate to
      the final grades from school years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023,
      respectively." (p. 25)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcomes covering at least one academic year.
      The paper uses final grades from two school years (2021/2022 and
      2022/2023) and conducts a second follow-up in November-December 2023.
      Together, these details show that measurement spans more than a single
      academic year.

      Final: Criterion Y is met because outcomes cover multiple school years
      and include an 18-month follow-up.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Extra instructional time is the intervention itself and is explicitly
      tested.
    quote: >-
      In response to our invitation to participate in the online tutoring
      program, 30% of the students did in fact take part, usually attending
      weekly sessions for more than three months.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In response to our invitation to participate in the online tutoring
      program, 30% of the students did in fact take part, usually attending
      weekly sessions for more than three months." (p. 6)

      2) "Students assigned to the treatment group received an invitation to
      participate in the Lern-Fair online tutoring program." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The treatment is explicitly an online tutoring program, which by
      definition adds instructional time and support. The additional tutoring
      time is not an incidental add-on; it is the intervention being tested
      ("online tutoring"). Under the updated ERCT criterion B rules, when the
      extra time/resources are integral to the treatment variable, the control
      group can remain business-as-usual, and the criterion can still be met,
      provided this intent is clear. Here, the intent is to estimate the
      effect of offering/receiving tutoring, so the resource difference is the
      treatment itself.

      Final: Criterion B is met because the extra instructional time is the
      core treatment being tested.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: No independent replications were found in available sources.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      No independent replication studies were found in the sources checked.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires independent reproduction by other authors. I searched
      for later or parallel studies explicitly reproducing this specific RCT and
      its results (using the exact title, author list, and the Lern-Fair program
      name) across major working-paper listings and indexes where this study is
      hosted (EdWorkingPapers, IZA, RFBerlin, and RePEc/IDEAS). These sources
      only list the original study by the same author team and do not surface
      independent replication papers.

      Final: Criterion R is not met because no independent replications were
      found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Not applicable because exam-based assessment is not used and outcomes are
      not across all core exams.
    quote: >-
      To measure school performance, we preregistered two main outcomes: grades
      in math and grade retention.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To measure school performance, we preregistered two main outcomes:
      grades in math and grade retention." (p. 25)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires exam-based assessment (criterion E) and effects
      measured across all core subjects/exams. Because criterion E is not met,
      criterion A is automatically not met under the ERCT rules. In addition,
      the preregistered school performance outcomes focus on math grades and
      grade retention, not a full set of core subject exam outcomes.

      Final: Criterion A is not met because criterion E is not met and outcomes
      are not across all core exams/subjects.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No evidence of tracking outcomes until graduation for the full cohort was
      found.
    quote: >-
      At this point, students, particularly those on the non-academic school
      track (which finishes after grade 9 or 10), face crucial decisions
      regarding their educational and career paths.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "At this point, students, particularly those on the non-academic
      school track (which finishes after grade 9 or 10), face crucial decisions
      regarding their educational and career paths." (p. 6)

      2) "The second survey (follow-up II) took place in November and December
      2023." (p. 17)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking students until graduation. The study's
      longer follow-up is about 18 months after program start and focuses on
      school-to-work transitions during a key decision period, especially for
      non-academic tracks that can end after grade 9 or 10. The paper does not
      report tracking the full cohort to graduation outcomes, and I did not
      find subsequent publications by the same author team that extend follow-up
      to graduation for this RCT in the sources checked.

      Final: Criterion G is not met because there is no evidence of tracking the
      cohort until graduation.
  p:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study reports preregistration in the AEA RCT Registry and analyzes
      outcomes as registered.
    quote: >-
      The experiment was preregistered in the AEA RCT registry, AEARCTR-0008937.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The experiment was preregistered in the AEA RCT registry,
      AEARCTR-0008937." (p. 3)

      2) "All outcomes are analyzed as registered." (p. 83)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper explicitly states that the experiment was preregistered in
      the AEA RCT Registry (with an AEARCTR identifier), and the appendix
      discusses deviations from a preregistered analysis plan while stating that
      all outcomes are analyzed as registered. In this environment, the AEA RCT
      Registry pages themselves were not accessible for an independent check of
      the registry's registration timestamp, so this assessment relies on the
      paper's explicit preregistration statement and internal consistency with
      a preregistered plan.

      Final: Criterion P is met because the study reports preregistration in the
      AEA RCT Registry and analyzes outcomes as registered.
