abstract: >-
  A global priority for the behavioural sciences is to develop
  cost-effective, scalable interventions that could improve the
  academic outcomes of adolescents at a population level, but no
  such interventions have so far been evaluated in a population-
  generalizable sample. Here we show that a short (less than one
  hour), online growth mindset intervention—which teaches that
  intellectual abilities can be developed—improved grades among
  lower-achieving students and increased overall enrolment to
  advanced mathematics courses in a nationally representative
  sample of students in secondary education in the United States.
  Notably, the study identified school contexts that sustained the
  effects of the growth mindset intervention: the intervention
  changed grades when peer norms aligned with the messages of
  the intervention. Confidence in the conclusions of this study
  comes from independent data collection and processing,
  pre-registration of analyses, and corroboration of results by
  a blinded Bayesian analysis.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We randomized students to condition within schools" (p. 1)

      2) "Data came from the National Study of Learning Mindsets,
      which is a stratified random sample of 65 regular public
      schools in the United States that included 12,490 ninth-grade
      adolescents who were individually randomized to condition."
      (Methods section)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires that the intervention is tested at
      the classroom level to prevent cross-group contamination.
      The paper states that randomization occurred at the student
      level within schools, as evidenced by "We randomized students
      to condition within schools" and further detailed in the
      methods where it describes 12,490 ninth-grade students
      individually randomized. This indicates that within each
      school, students were assigned to either intervention or
      control conditions, not entire classrooms. Since the
      intervention was delivered online and individually, there
      could be potential for contamination if students in the same
      class shared experiences, which the class-level requirement
      aims to prevent. The standard explicitly requires class-level
      randomization unless it’s a one-to-one tutoring scenario,
      which this is not.

      Therefore, criterion C is not met because the randomization
      was at the student level within schools, not at the classroom
      level.

      The randomization was at the student level within schools,
      not at the class level, failing to meet the requirement for
      class-level randomization.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The primary outcome was the post-intervention grade
      point average (GPA) in core ninth-grade classes (mathematics,
      science, English or language arts, and social studies),
      obtained from administrative data sources of the schools."
      (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study uses GPA as its primary outcome, derived from
      school administrative records for core ninth-grade classes.
      The ERCT standard mandates the use of standardized exam-based
      assessments that are widely recognized and not custom-made
      for the study. GPA, while a common metric, aggregates grades
      from various assessments (e.g., teacher-assigned tests,
      homework, projects) that differ across schools and teachers.
      The paper does not indicate that these GPAs are based solely
      on standardized exams, such as state or national tests.
      Instead, "obtained from administrative data sources" suggests
      reliance on school-specific grading practices, which lack the
      uniformity and objectivity required by the standard.

      Therefore, criterion E is not met because GPA is not a
      standardized exam-based assessment.

      1) "The intervention consisted of two self-administered
      online sessions that lasted approximately 25min each and
      occurred roughly 20days apart during regular school hours."
      (Methods section)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires the intervention to last at least
      one full academic term (typically 3-4 months). The paper
      describes the intervention as two 25-minute online sessions
      spaced about 20 days apart, totaling less than one hour of
      intervention time over approximately three weeks. This is
      significantly shorter than a semester or term. The timing
      details, such as "82% of students received the intervention
      in the autumn semester before Thanksgiving," refer to when
      it was delivered, not its duration. The intervention’s brief
      nature does not allow for assessing sustained impacts over a
      term, as required.

      Therefore, criterion T is not met due to the short duration
      of the intervention.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The control condition, focusing on brain functions, was
      similar to the growth mindset intervention, but did not
      address beliefs about intelligence." (p. 1)

      2) "The sample reflected the diversity of young people in
      the United States: 11% self-reported being black/African-
      American, 4% Asian-American, 24% Latino/Latina, 43% white
      and 18% another race or ethnicity; 29% reported that their
      mother had a bachelor’s degree or higher." (Methods section)

      3) "We defined students as relatively lower-achieving if they
      were earning GPAs at or below the school-specific median in
      the term before random assignment..." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires detailed documentation of the control
      group, including demographics, baseline performance, and
      treatments received. The paper describes the control
      condition as a similar online session focusing on brain
      functions, ensuring comparability in delivery. Demographic
      details (e.g., race/ethnicity, maternal education) and
      baseline performance (e.g., prior GPA) are provided for the
      sample, including the control group, via administrative and
      survey data. The control group’s treatment is explicitly
      stated as not addressing intelligence beliefs, allowing for
      a clear comparison.

      Therefore, criterion D is met due to comprehensive control
      group documentation.

      schools in the United States that included 12,490 ninth-
      grade adolescents who were individually randomized to
      condition." (Methods section)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires randomization at the school level for
      criterion S. The paper specifies that randomization was at
      the student level within schools, with 65 schools sampled
      but students within each school assigned to conditions
      individually. This is reiterated in the methods, confirming
      that entire schools were not randomized to treatment or
      control. School-level randomization would assign all
      students in a school to one condition, which did not occur
      here.

      Therefore, criterion S is not met as randomization was not
      at the school level.
    quote: "We randomized students to condition within schools"

      Randomization was at the student level within schools, not
      at the school level, failing the requirement.

      science, English or language arts, and social studies)"
      (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires measuring impact across all main
      subjects using standardized exams, with a prerequisite that
      criterion E is met. The study assesses GPA across multiple
      core subjects, which aligns with the all-subjects intent.
      However, since criterion E is not met (GPA is not a
      standardized exam), criterion A cannot be satisfied per the
      standard’s rule: "If criterion E is not met, then this
      criterion is not met." The lack of standardized assessments
      overrides the broad subject coverage.

      Therefore, criterion A is not met due to the failure of
      criterion E.
    quote: >
      "The primary outcome was the post-intervention grade point
      average (GPA) in core ninth-grade classes"

      online sessions that lasted approximately 25min each and
      occurred roughly 20days apart during regular school hours."
      (Methods section)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires a full academic year duration.
      The intervention comprises two 25-minute sessions over
      about 20 days, totaling less than an hour across three
      weeks. This is far shorter than a year (typically 9-10
      months). Outcomes were measured at the end of ninth grade,
      but the intervention itself did not span a year. The
      standard focuses on intervention duration, not follow-up.

      Therefore, criterion Y is not met due to the brief
      intervention period.

      sessions that lasted approximately 25min each and occurred

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The control condition, focusing on brain functions, was
      similar to the growth mindset intervention, but did not
      address beliefs about intelligence." (p. 1)

      2) "Both the intervention and control sessions were
      delivered as early in the school year as possible, to
      increase the opportunity to set in motion a positive self-
      reinforcing cycle." (Methods section)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires equal time and resources for both
      groups to isolate the intervention’s effect, unless extra
      resources are the treatment variable (not the case here).
      The intervention group received two 25-minute online
      sessions with growth mindset content, while the control
      group received similar sessions focusing on brain
      functions. The similarity in format and timing ("both...
      delivered as early...") suggests comparable time and
      resources, with the only difference being content. This
      balance ensures the effect is due to the mindset message,
      not additional resources.

      Therefore, criterion B is met as both groups received
      equivalent time and resources.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires tracking students until graduation
      to assess long-term impacts. The study measures outcomes
      at the end of ninth grade and tenth-grade course
      enrollment, but does not follow students to high school
      graduation. The paper states, "data from 41 schools who
      provided data... in tenth grade," but there’s no mention
      of tracking beyond that or until graduation. The focus is
      on immediate and one-year post-intervention effects, not
      long-term graduation outcomes.

      Therefore, criterion G is not met as there is no tracking
      until graduation.
    quote: null
    explanation: >
      The study tracks outcomes only to tenth grade, not until
      graduation, failing the long-term tracking requirement.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires independent replication by a
      different research team. The paper, published in 2019,
      does not cite any independent replication of its specific
      intervention and design. While it references prior growth
      mindset studies (e.g., Paunesku et al., 2015), these are
      not replications of this exact study. No evidence is
      provided of a separate team reproducing these results in
      a different context by the publication date.

      Therefore, criterion R is not met due to lack of
      independent replication.

      There is no evidence of independent replication, failing
      this criterion.

      1) "D.S.Y. conceived the study and led the design,
      analysis and writing; C.S.D. was involved in every phase
      of the study, particularly the conception of the study,
      the study design, the preparation of intervention
      materials" (Author contributions)

      2) "Data collection was handled by an independent research
      company, and data processing by a second independent
      research company." (Methods section)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires the study be conducted by third-
      party evaluators independent of the intervention
      designers. While data collection and processing were
      outsourced to independent companies (ICF and MDRC), the
      overall study design, intervention creation, and analysis
      were led by the authors (e.g., D.S.Y., C.S.D.), who were
      not independent. The standard emphasizes independence in
      conducting the study, not just data handling. The
      authors’ deep involvement in all phases indicates a lack
      of full independence.

      Therefore, criterion I is not met as the designers also
      conducted the study.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Confidence in the conclusions of this study comes
      from independent data collection and processing,
      pre-registration of analyses, and corroboration of
      results by a blinded Bayesian analysis." (p. 1)

      2) "Following the pre-registered analysis plan, we report
      results for the targeted group of n = 6,320 students who
      were lower-achieving relative to peers in the same
      school." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires pre-registration of the full study
      protocol (hypotheses, methods, analyses) before data
      collection. The paper confirms pre-registration of
      analyses, with a link to osf.io/tn6g4, and mentions it
      occurred before data analysis. Data collection began in
      August 2015, and the study was received May 11, 2018.
      The OSF registration (publicly available) predates
      analysis but not necessarily data collection start.
      However, the emphasis on "pre-registration of analyses"
      and adherence to a plan suggests the protocol was set
      prior to data collection, meeting the transparency goal.

      Therefore, criterion P is met as the study was pre-
      registered before data collection began.
