abstract: >-
  A global priority for the behavioural sciences is to develop cost-effective,
  scalable interventions that could improve the academic outcomes of
  adolescents at a population level, but no such interventions have so far
  been evaluated in a population-generalizable sample. Here we show that a
  short (less than one hour), online growth mindset intervention—which
  teaches that intellectual abilities can be developed—improved grades
  among lower-achieving students and increased overall enrolment to
  advanced mathematics courses in a nationally representative sample of
  students in secondary education in the United States. Notably, the
  study identified school contexts that sustained the effects of the growth
  mindset intervention: the intervention changed grades when peer norms
  aligned with the messages of the intervention. Confidence in the
  conclusions of this study comes from independent data collection and
  processing, pre-registration of analyses, and corroboration of results by
  a blinded Bayesian analysis.

  c:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomisation was conducted at the individual student level within
      schools rather than at the class level, leading to potential
      contamination across students in the same class.
    quote: >-
      "12,490 ninth-grade adolescents who were individually randomized to
      condition." (p. 1)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "12,490 ninth-grade adolescents who were individually randomized
      to condition." (p. 1)
      
      2) "The coin-tossing symbol indicates that random assignment was
      made during session 1." (Fig. 1, p. 2)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The paper describes random assignment of individual students
      within schools ("individually randomized"), rather than assigning
      entire classes to treatment or control. The ERCT 'C' criterion
      requires at minimum class-level randomisation to prevent
      contamination between groups. This individual-level
      randomisation fails to satisfy the class-level RCT requirement.
      
      Thus, criterion C is not met because randomization occurred at the student
      level within classes rather than at the class level, introducing a risk of
      contamination.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The primary outcome is based on post‑intervention grade point
      averages from school records, not a standardized exam‑based
      assessment.
    quote: >-
      "The primary outcome was the post‑intervention grade point average
      (GPA) in core ninth‑grade classes…" (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "The primary outcome was the post‑intervention grade point
      average (GPA) in core ninth‑grade classes…" (p. 3)
      
      2) "Grades and course taking… After ninth grade." (Fig. 1, p. 2)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT 'E' criterion requires use of a standardized exam‑based
      assessment. Here, the study uses administrative GPAs, which vary
      by school and teacher and are not a uniform, standardized test.
      Therefore, the criterion is not satisfied.
      
      Thus, criterion E is not met because the study's outcomes are GPAs rather
      than standardized exam scores.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes (end‑of‑year GPAs) were measured at the end of the
      academic year, at least one full term after the intervention.
    quote: >-
      "Grades and course taking… After ninth grade." (Fig. 1, p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "Intervention and survey… Before data collection Ninth grade 1–4
      weeks later* After ninth grade" (Fig. 1, p. 2)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The timeline shows that the intervention occurred early in the
      ninth‑grade year, and outcomes were measured at the end of the
      same school year. This covers more than one full academic term
      (~9 months), satisfying the requirement for term‑duration follow‑up.
      
      Therefore, criterion T is met because outcomes were measured at the end of
      the school year, more than one full term after the intervention began.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control condition and its baseline data are clearly described,
      including content, fidelity, and demographics.
    quote: >-
      "The control condition, focusing on brain functions, was similar to
      the growth mindset intervention, but did not address beliefs about
      intelligence." (p. 8)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "The control condition, focusing on brain functions, was similar to
      the growth mindset intervention, but did not address beliefs about
      intelligence." (p. 8)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The paper documents the control group’s materials, delivery
      protocol and fidelity metrics. This level of documentation meets
      the ERCT 'D' criterion for a documented control group.
      
      Thus, criterion D is met as the control group was thoroughly documented.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomisation occurred at the student level within schools, not at
      the school level.
    quote: >-
      "individually randomized to condition." (p. 1)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "12,490 ninth‑grade adolescents who were individually randomized
      to condition." (p. 1)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      Level 2 criterion 'S' requires randomisation among schools as units.
      This study randomized individual students within schools, so it
      fails to meet the school‑level RCT requirement.
      
      Hence, criterion S is not met since randomization was done at the student
      level rather than the school level.
  i:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Independent professional research companies conducted data
      collection and processing, separate from the intervention designers.
    quote: >-
      "Two different professional research companies… were contracted."
      (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "One company (ICF)… obtained administrative data… clean and
      merged data… blind to treatment conditions." (p. 7)
      
      2) "A second professional research company (MDRC) processed the
      data… blind to the consequences… as described in Supplementary
      Information section 12." (p. 7)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The study explicitly describes the use of independent firms for
      recruitment, data collection, and data processing, separate from
      the design team. This satisfies the ERCT 'I' criterion for independent
      conduct.
      
      Therefore, criterion I is met because independent external firms handled
      the implementation and data, minimizing bias.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were tracked through the end of ninth grade, covering a
      full academic year.
    quote: >-
      "After ninth grade" (Fig. 1, p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "After ninth grade" (Fig. 1 timeline)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The study measured outcomes at the end of ninth grade,
      approximately one academic year after start, thus meeting the
      Year‑Duration requirement.
      
      Thus, criterion Y is met, having tracked outcomes through approximately one
      academic year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Both intervention and control groups received equivalent session
      time and attention, balancing educational inputs.
    quote: >-
      "The intervention consisted of two self-administered online
      sessions… The control condition… was similar… but did not
      address beliefs about intelligence." (p. 8)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "The intervention consisted of two self-administered online
      sessions… lasted approximately 25 min each." (p. 8)
      
      2) "The control condition, focusing on brain functions, was similar…"
      (p. 8)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      Both groups engaged in two sessions of equal duration and
      structure. There was no difference in time or materials beyond
      content focus, satisfying the Balanced Control Group criterion.
      
      Therefore, criterion B is met since both the intervention and control groups
      received equal session time and similar materials (only the content differed).
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication of this national study by a different
      team is reported.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) No mention of subsequent, independent replication of this
      specific experiment appears in the paper.
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The paper references previous pilot studies but does not report an
      independent replication of the National Study of Learning Mindsets.
      Since publication, an independent analysis by a third party (MDRC)
      corroborated the main results using the original data, and a similar
      intervention was tested in another country (Norway) with support from the
      original authors. However, no fully independent replication study has been
      published to date.
      
      As such, criterion R is not met because no independent replication by an
      external team has been reported.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No standardized exam-based assessments across all core subjects;
      the study relies on administrative GPAs.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "The primary outcome was the post‑intervention grade point
      average (GPA) in core ninth‑grade classes…" (p. 3)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      All‑subject Exams requires standardized exam scores across major
      subjects. Using GPAs from school records does not meet the
      standardized exam requirement.
      
      Hence, criterion A is not met as no standardized exams across all core
      subjects were used.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Participants were only tracked through ninth grade; no graduation
      tracking is reported.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) No follow-up beyond ninth grade is described.
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The study concludes data collection at the end of ninth grade with
      no evidence of further graduate tracking, failing the Graduation
      Tracking criterion.
      
      Thus, criterion G is not met because the study did not follow students
      through to high school graduation.
  p:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The analysis plan and moderation hypotheses were pre-registered
      on OSF prior to data analysis.
    quote: >-
      "The tick symbol indicates that a comprehensive analysis plan was
      pre-registered at https://osf.io/tn6g4." (Fig. 1 legend, p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "The tick symbol indicates that a comprehensive analysis plan was
      pre-registered at https://osf.io/tn6g4." (Fig. 1 legend, p. 2)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The study explicitly notes pre-registration of hypotheses and
      analysis plan before conducting data collection and analysis,
      satisfying the Pre-registered Protocol criterion.
      
      Therefore, criterion P is met because the study protocol and analysis plan
      were pre-registered before data collection.
