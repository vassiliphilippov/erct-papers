  OBJECTIVES: Physical inactivity is an important health concern worldwide.
  We examined the effects of an exercise intervention on children’s academic
  achievement, cognitive function, physical fitness, and other health-related
  outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cluster RCT among 2301
  fourth‑grade students in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Schools were randomized
  to intervention or control using stratified block randomization. The
  intervention comprised twice‑weekly HIIT sessions over 10 weeks, replacing
  the initial segment of physical education classes. The primary outcome was
  national examination scores in mathematics and Mongolian language. A linear
  mixed‑effects model compared pre‑ and post‑intervention scores. RESULTS:
  Of 2301 students, 2101 completed the trial. Intervention groups showed
  greater improvements in total examination scores than controls (urban:
  +8.36 points, 95% CI: 6.06–10.66; mixed: +9.55 points, 95% CI:
  6.58–12.51). No injuries were reported. CONCLUSIONS: A school‑based HIIT
  program significantly improved academic achievement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Stratified block randomization was used to randomly allocate the 10
      cluster schools into the intervention and control groups.” (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper describes randomization at the school (cluster) level, which
      exceeds the class‑level requirement by preventing cross‑class
      contamination.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met because school‑level
      randomization satisfies or exceeds class‑level RCT.
    explanation: >-
      Randomization was conducted at the school (cluster) level, satisfying the
      class‑level RCT criterion.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The primary outcome was academic achievement, assessed by the
      participants’ total mathematics and Mongolian language scores on the
      national examination.” (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study uses national examination scores—a standardized, widely
      recognized assessment—rather than a custom test, fulfilling the
      Exam‑based Assessment criterion.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is met because a national
      standardized exam was used.
    explanation: >-
      The study measured outcomes using national examination scores, a
      standardized assessment.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “This population-based cluster RCT was conducted ... from February to
      December 2018.” (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention and follow‑up spanned roughly ten months—longer than a
      typical academic term (~3–4 months)—and outcomes were measured at the
      end of that period, satisfying Term Duration.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met because follow‑up lasted
      more than one term.
    explanation: >-
      Intervention and follow‑up lasted ten months, exceeding a full academic
      term.

      2) Tables 1 and 2 detail control‑group demographics and baseline scores.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The control group’s composition, size, and baseline characteristics are
      clearly documented, fulfilling the requirement for a well‑documented
      control group.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because the control group
      is fully described.
    explanation: >-
      The control group’s size and baseline characteristics are clearly
      documented in the methods and tables.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Entire schools, not individual classes or students, were randomized to
      conditions, satisfying the School‑level RCT criterion.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is met because randomization was
      at the school level.
    explanation: >-
      Entire schools were randomized, satisfying the school‑level RCT criterion.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention developers also conducted and analyzed the trial with no
      external evaluation, failing the Independent Conduct criterion.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is not met because no
      independent evaluator was involved.
    explanation: >-
      The same team that designed the intervention conducted and analyzed the
      trial without independent oversight.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Participants were followed for approximately ten months—covering a full
      academic year—thus satisfying Year Duration.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is met because the follow‑up
      spanned a full year.
    explanation: >-
      Participants were tracked from February through December—one full academic
      year.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The intervention group received a 3‑minute HIIT program ... implemented
      twice weekly over 10 weeks ... For the rest of the class, participants
      underwent the normal physical education class.” (pp. 1–3)

      2) “Control group participants received the usual physical education class.”
      (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The HIIT sessions replaced an equal duration of standard PE time,
      so both groups had equivalent class time.
      Although the intervention was delivered by additional instructors (MNIPE teachers and RAs),
      this was integral to the program and not an extra academic resource. Therefore,
      Balanced Resources is satisfied.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met because instructional time
      and resources were balanced.
    explanation: >-
      HIIT was integrated into standard PE time without additional class time or
      resources, keeping groups balanced.
    quote: >-

      education class. Control group participants received the usual physical

      Detailed Analysis:

      No independent replication of this study is cited, so the Reproduced
      criterion is not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is not met because no replication
      exists.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Only two subjects (mathematics and language arts) were tested, not all core
      subjects, failing the All‑subject Exams criterion.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because only two
      subjects were assessed.
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured only in mathematics and Mongolian language, not all
      main subjects.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Follow-up ended at study completion in December 2018; participants were not
      tracked through to graduation, so Graduation Tracking is not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is not met because there was no
      follow-up until graduation.
    explanation: >-
      Participants were not followed until graduation; follow-up ended at study
      completion.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “This trial has been registered with UMIN Clinical Trials Registry
      (identifier UMIN000031062).” (p. 9)
      2) “Trial registration: UMIN: UMIN000031062. Registered on 1st February 2018.” (UMIN-CTR)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Registration is documented, and trial registry records confirm it was registered on 1st February 2018
      (before data collection),
      so the Pre‑registered Protocol criterion is met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is met because registration occurred before data collection started.
    explanation: >-
      Trial registration was completed before the study began (registered 1st February 2018).
    quote: >-
