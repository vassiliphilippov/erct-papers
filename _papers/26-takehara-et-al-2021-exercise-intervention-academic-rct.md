abstract: >-
  Physical inactivity is an important health concern worldwide. In this study,
  we examined the effects of an exercise intervention on children's academic
  achievement, cognitive function, physical fitness, and other health-related
  outcomes. We conducted a population-based cluster randomized controlled
  trial among 2301 fourth-grade students from 10 of 11 public primary schools
  in 1 district of Ulaanbaatar between February and December 2018. Schools
  were allocated to an intervention or control group with 5 schools each by
  using urban and mixed residential area stratified block randomization. The
  intervention group received a 3-minute high-intensity interval exercise
  program that included jumps, squats, and various steps implemented twice
  weekly over 10 weeks for 10 to 25 minutes per session. The control group
  received the usual physical education class. The primary outcome was
  academic achievement assessed by scores on the national examination. A
  linear mixed-effects model was applied. The difference between
  preintervention and post intervention was compared by least-squares means,
  estimated on the basis of the interaction of group, measurement time point,
  and school location. Only 1 statistician, responsible for the analysis, was
  blinded. Of 2301 students, 2101 (1069 intervention; 1032 control) were
  included in the analysis. Intervention group members in an urban area
  showed an 8.36-point improvement (95% confidence interval: 6.06 to 10.66)
  in academic scores when compared with the control group, whereas those in
  a mixed residential area showed a 9.55-point improvement (95% confidence
  interval: 6.58 to 12.51). No intervention-associated injuries were
  observed. The exercise program significantly improved children's academic
  achievement.

      2) "Stratified block randomization was used to randomly allocate the 10
      cluster schools into the intervention and control groups." (Page 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study describes a cluster randomized controlled trial where entire
      schools were randomized to either the intervention or control group.
      This means that all classes within a school received the same treatment,
      which satisfies the requirement for a class-level RCT. In fact, since
      entire schools were randomized, this is even stronger than randomizing
      individual classes, as it minimizes contamination across groups within
      the same school.

      The study meets the criterion for a class-level RCT because entire
      schools, and thus all classes within those schools, were randomized to
      treatment or control.

      2) "The participants’ scores ranged from 0 to 100 points, meaning the
      total score for both ranged from 0 to 200 points." (Page 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study used scores from the national examination in mathematics and
      Mongolian language as the primary outcome measure. National
      examinations are typically standardized and widely recognized, meeting
      the ERCT requirement for a standardized exam-based assessment rather
      than a custom test designed for the study.

      The study meets the criterion for exam-based assessment because it used
      scores from a national standardized examination.

      The study does not fully meet the criterion for term duration because
      the intervention lasted for 10 weeks, which is slightly less than a
      typical academic term of 3-4 months.

      the second phase, which lasted 4 weeks from October to November 2018, ..."
      (Page 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention lasted a total of 10 weeks, approximately 2.5 months,
      split into two phases (6 weeks and 4 weeks). The ERCT Standard defines a
      term as typically a semester or equivalent, around 3-4 months. While the
      intervention spanned parts of two seasons, its active duration of 10
      weeks falls short of the typical term length. Even considering the
      break between phases, it does not extend to a full term.

      The study does not fully meet the criterion for term duration because
      the intervention lasted for 10 weeks, which is slightly less than a
      typical academic term of 3-4 months.

      The study meets the criterion for a documented control group because it
      provides detailed information about the control group's characteristics
      and the treatment they received.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The control group received the usual physical education class."
      (Page 1)

      2) "Control group participants received the usual physical education
      class consisting of a 10-minute warm-up and stretching; 30-minute
      activities, such as small-sided team sport games, for example,
      basketball, jump rope, and throw and catch activities; and a 5-minute
      cooldown." (Page 3)

      3) Table 2 ("Background of Participants") provides demographic information
      for both intervention and control groups. (Page 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study clearly describes the control group’s treatment as the
      standard physical education class, detailing its structure and
      activities. Additionally, Table 2 provides baseline characteristics such
      as age, sex, house type, household income, parental education, and
      siblings for both groups, ensuring comparability and transparency.
      This satisfies the ERCT requirement for a well-documented control group.

      The study meets the criterion for a documented control group because it
      provides detailed information about the control group's characteristics
      and the treatment they received.

      The study meets the criterion for a school-level RCT because entire
      schools were randomized to treatment or control.

      2) "Stratified block randomization was used to randomly allocate the 10
      cluster schools into the intervention and control groups." (Page 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study explicitly states that randomization occurred at the school
      level, with entire schools assigned to either the intervention or
      control group using stratified block randomization. This meets the ERCT
      requirement for a school-level RCT, which is stronger than class-level
      randomization and reduces contamination risks.

      The study meets the criterion for a school-level RCT because entire
      schools were randomized to treatment or control.

      The study does not meet the criterion for all-subject exams because it
      only assessed performance in mathematics and Mongolian language, not
      all main subjects.
    quote: >

      2) "The secondary outcomes were the individual mathematics and
      Mongolian scores..." (Page 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study measured academic achievement using scores from mathematics
      and Mongolian language exams, which are core subjects. However, the
      ERCT criterion requires assessment across all main subjects taught in
      the school (e.g., science, social studies, etc.). Since only two subjects
      were assessed, it does not meet the all-subject exams requirement,
      despite using standardized exams (Criterion E is met).

      The study does not meet the criterion for all-subject exams because it
      only assessed performance in mathematics and Mongolian language, not
      all main subjects.

      The study does not meet the criterion for year duration because the
      intervention lasted only 10 weeks, not a full academic year.
    quote: >
      "The intervention group received a 3-minute high-intensity interval
      exercise program that included jumps, squats, and various steps

      (Page 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention’s total duration was 10 weeks, far less than a full
      academic year (typically 9-10 months). Even accounting for the two
      phases, the active intervention period does not span a year. Since
      Criterion T (Term Duration) is not met, and Y requires a longer
      duration, this criterion is also not satisfied.

      The study does not meet the criterion for year duration because the
      intervention lasted only 10 weeks, not a full academic year.

      The study does not meet the criterion for balanced resources because
      the intervention group received additional exercise sessions, while the
      control group did not receive equivalent additional resources.

      2) "The control group received the usual physical education class."
      (Page 1)

      3) "Control group participants received the usual physical education
      class consisting of a 10-minute warm-up and stretching; 30-minute
      activities... and a 5-minute cooldown." (Page 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention group received a specific HIIT program twice weekly in
      addition to regular physical education, totaling 20-50 minutes of extra
      activity per week. The control group received only the standard
      physical education class (45 minutes per session), with no additional
      time or resources to match the intervention’s input. The ERCT Standard
      requires equivalent resources unless the extra resource is the
      treatment variable, which is not explicitly stated here. This imbalance
      suggests the intervention’s effect may be due to extra time rather than
      the specific program.

      The study does not meet the criterion for balanced resources because
      the intervention group received additional exercise sessions, while the
      control group did not receive equivalent additional resources.

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      There is no mention in the paper of tracking students until graduation.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study measured outcomes immediately after the intervention (in the
      same academic year) and did not track participants through to a later
      educational milestone or graduation. A search for follow-up studies by
      the authors found none; the trial’s registry indicates outcomes were
      assessed only in May 2018, with no further follow-up of
      these students.

      The study does not meet the criterion for graduation tracking because
      it did not follow up with students until their graduation.

      The study does not meet the criterion for replicated results because

    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      There is no mention in the paper of the study being independently
      replicated.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires that the study be replicated by an
      independent research team in a different context. No independent
      replication of this trial by other researchers has been published as of
      2025. In fact, similar school-based physical activity RCTs in other 
      settings have shown mixed results, and a large cluster RCT in Norway 
      concluded that evidence is still "inadequate... to conclude that 
      increased physical activity in school enhances academic achievement in 
      all children"&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Thus, the study does not meet the criterion for 
      replicated results because there is no evidence of an independent replication.

      The study does not meet the criterion for independent conduct because
      it was conducted by the same team that designed the intervention.

      Relevant Quotes:

      The authors are affiliated with various institutions, including the
      National Center for Child Health and Development in Japan and the
      Mongolian National Institute of Physical Education. It appears that the
      study was conducted by the authors themselves.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires that the study be conducted by an
      independent third party, separate from those who designed the
      intervention. The paper indicates that the authors conceptualized,
      designed, and implemented the study, with no mention of an external
      evaluator. This lack of independence fails the criterion.

      The study does not meet the criterion for independent conduct because
      it was conducted by the same team that designed the intervention.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study was registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, which
      satisfies the ERCT requirement for a pre-registered protocol. According
      to the trial’s record, it was registered on February 1, 2018, before
      the enrollment of participants on February 6, 2018&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
      This timing confirms that the protocol was pre-registered prior to data
      collection.

      The study meets the criterion for a pre-registered protocol because it
