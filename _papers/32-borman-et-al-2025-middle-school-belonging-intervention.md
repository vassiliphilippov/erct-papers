abstract: >-
  Recent randomized studies suggest brief social-psychological interventions can
  help students reappraise common social and academic worries during the
  difficult transition to middle school and, in turn, improve school
  performance. We conducted a preregistered student-level randomized controlled
  trial to assess the replicability of these findings for sixth-grade students
  transitioning to middle school in three Texas schools (n=604). Hypothesized
  main effects for the preregistered confirmatory academic and behavioral
  outcomes did not replicate. However, exploratory analyses revealed that
  treatment students with greater numbers of disciplinary referrals during the
  transition to middle school experienced larger reductions in referrals after
  intervention than those with fewer baseline referrals. Also, students of color
  showed greater improvements in their grade point averages after intervention
  than their white and Asian peers. Non-replicated main effects may be explained
  by an unusual district context and by evidence suggesting that the
  intervention mitigated students' academic worries but did not resolve social
  worries.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We conducted a preregistered student-level randomized controlled trial
      to assess the replicability of these findings..." (p. 1)

      2) "A total of 808 sixth-grade students were randomly assigned to either
      the treatment or control conditions within each school." (p. 5)

      3) "We randomized only those students who were on the original rosters at
      the beginning of the school year..." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires that the study be conducted at the class level
      or school level to prevent contamination, unless it involves personal
      tutoring. The paper explicitly states that this was a "student-level"
      randomized controlled trial where students were assigned to conditions
      "within each school." While the intervention was administered within
      classrooms using packets, randomization was not done by class. Since the
      intervention involves writing exercises done in a shared classroom
      environment, student-level randomization does not meet the strict
      class-level requirement designed to minimize contamination.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is not met because the study used
      student-level randomization rather than class-level or school-level
      randomization.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We calculated a student's GPA using administrative data provided by
      the school district. The letter grades were converted into a numerical
      score (i.e., A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0), and the average score was
      computed." (p. 6)

      2) "The analysis focused on core academic courses only, including math,
      science, English language arts, and history/social studies." (p. 6)

      3) "Outcomes... D and F grade counts, school attendance rates, and
      disciplinary referral and suspension counts." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires the use of standardized exam-based
      assessments that are widely recognised. This study uses Grade Point
      Averages (GPA) derived from teacher-assigned letter grades in core
      courses, as well as counts of D and F grades. These are school-based
      measures, not standardized external exams. There is no mention of state
      standardized tests (e.g., STAAR in Texas) being used as the outcome
      measure.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is not met because the outcomes
      measured were teacher-assigned grades (GPA) rather than standardized
      exams.

      1) "The first exercise... was administered early in the school year
      (September)... The process was then repeated approximately 6 weeks later
      (November)..." (p. 5)

      2) "we created the GPA outcome measure using the post-treatment GPA by
      averaging students' GPAs from the final three quarters of the school year.
      The first term GPA served as the baseline measure." (pp. 6-7)

      3) "We measured student suspension as the total number of suspensions
      accumulated after the date of the second intervention administration..."
      (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention began in September and the second part occurred in
      November. The outcomes were measured based on the "final three quarters of
      the school year" (Terms 2, 3, and 4). A typical academic year runs until
      May or June. The interval from the start of the intervention (September)
      to the end of data collection (end of school year) exceeds one full
      academic term (3-4 months).

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met because the outcomes were
      tracked over the course of the remainder of the school year, exceeding the
      one-term duration requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In the control condition, students also completed two writing
      exercises of equal length, but the prompts focused on neutral middle
      school experiences unrelated to belonging uncertainty, including dealing
      with a noisy lunchroom and learning about politics." (p. 5)

      2) "Table 1... Student Sample Characteristics and Baseline Equivalence...
      Control (N=310)... White 0.17... Black 0.37..." (p. 10)

      3) "The packets given to treatment and control students had identical
      cover sheets..." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper provides a clear description of the control group's activities
      (neutral writing exercises) and documents their demographic
      characteristics and baseline performance in Table 1. The sample size and
      composition are explicitly detailed.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because the study provides
      comprehensive documentation of the control group's characteristics, size,
      and the specific "business as usual" or placebo activity they undertook.

      the treatment or control conditions within each school." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard for Level 2 requires randomization at the school level.
      This study explicitly used student-level randomization within schools.
      School-level randomization was not employed.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is not met because the study
      randomized individual students rather than schools.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The authors of the paper are the ones who conducted the trial ("We
      conducted..."). They are also the designers/adapters of the intervention
      based on their prior work (Borman et al., 2019). There is no statement
      indicating that an independent third party conducted the data collection
      or analysis.

      quarters of the school year." (pp. 6-7)

      3) "outcomes measured at least one full academic year after the
      intervention begins" (ERCT Standard)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention started in September, at the beginning of the academic
      year. The outcomes were aggregated over Terms 2, 3, and 4, effectively
      covering the rest of the academic year (typically ending in May/June). The
      tracking covers the full academic cycle (~9 months) from the start of the
      intervention.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is met because the study tracked
      outcomes through the end of the academic year, covering the required
      duration.

      3) "The intervention involved two 15-minute in-class exercises..." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study does not utilize additional resources (budget, extra tutoring
      time) as the treatment variable; it tests the content of a writing
      exercise. The control group activity was matched in terms of time (two
      15-minute exercises) and resources (identical packets, just different
      prompts). Both groups performed the task as "routine assignments within
      the sixth-grade English language arts classes." There was no imbalance in
      educational time or budget.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met because the control group
      received an equivalent placebo intervention matching the time and
      materials of the treatment group.
    quote: >-

      1) "We conducted a direct... replication of a brief middle-school

      3) "Borman et al. (2019) first studied the middle-school belonging
      intervention..." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires *independent* replication by a *different*
      research team. While this study is a replication of previous work, the
      lead author (Geoffrey D. Borman) is the same lead author of the original
      study (Borman et al., 2019). An independent search for replications of
      this specific middle-school belonging intervention by strictly external
      teams yielded no published results in peer-reviewed journals. Therefore,
      it does not constitute an independent replication.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is not met because the
      replication was conducted by the same primary researcher as the original
      study and no independent replications were found.
    quote: >-

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The analysis focused on core academic courses only, including math,

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study assessed GPA across all main core subjects (math, science, ELA,
      history). However, the ERCT standard states that if Criterion E
      (Exam-based Assessment) is not met, then Criterion A is automatically not
      met. Since this study used teacher-assigned grades (GPA) and not
      standardized exams, it fails this criterion despite covering multiple
      subjects.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because the outcome
      measures were not standardized exams (Criterion E not met).
    quote: >-
      "The analysis focused on core academic courses only, including math,
      science, English language arts, and history/social studies."

      2) "post-treatment GPA by averaging students' GPAs from the final three
      quarters of the school year." (pp. 6-7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study tracked students only until the end of the sixth-grade academic
      year. The ERCT standard requires tracking until graduation (e.g., end of
      8th grade for middle school or 12th grade for high school). A search for
      subsequent publications using the Killeen ISD sample (2018-19 cohort)
      authored by Borman et al. did not yield any follow-up studies tracking
      graduation rates, likely due to the null main effects reported in this
      study.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is not met because tracking ended
      at the conclusion of the single academic year, not upon graduation.
    quote: >-
      "we created the GPA outcome measure using the post-treatment GPA by
      averaging students' GPAs from the final three quarters of the school

      https://osf.io/45nek/)..." (p. 4)

      3) "We preregistered the study prior to recruitment of KISD..." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper explicitly states that the study was preregistered before the
      recruitment of the school district (i.e., before data collection). A link
      to the Open Science Framework (OSF) registration (https://osf.io/45nek/)
      is provided and confirms the registration details.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is met because the study provides
      evidence of preregistration prior to the start of data collection.
    quote: >-
      "We preregistered the study prior to recruitment of KISD"
    explanation: >-
      The study protocol was preregistered on OSF before the start of the study.
