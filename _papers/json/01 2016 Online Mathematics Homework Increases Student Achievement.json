    "abstract": "In a randomized field trial with 2,850 seventh-grade mathematics students, the authors evaluated whether an educational technology intervention (ASSISTments) increased mathematics learning when used for homework. The intervention provided automated feedback and hints for students, while delivering organized performance data to teachers so they could adapt their instruction. Results showed significant gains in math test scores, especially for students with lower prior achievement.",

        "analysis": "First, we look for evidence that the paper used a class-level (or stronger) randomization rather than randomizing students within the same classroom. The paper states: “We investigated this question through a randomized controlled experiment in which schools were assigned to either an intervention or a business-as-usual condition.” (p. 2). Also: “Schools were placed into pairs with similar prior achievement levels and enrollment sizes, and pairs were randomly assigned to treatment and control.” (p. 6) These quotes confirm that randomization took place at the school level, which is stronger than class-level randomization.\n\nBecause the randomization was performed at the school level, there is no risk of contamination within the same classroom, and it also automatically meets the weaker requirement of class-level randomization. The authors clearly describe how schools—rather than individual students—were assigned, noting that this was a ‘school-level RCT.’\n\nTherefore, since randomization was not student-level within a single classroom, and the authors do not rely on a one-to-one tutoring exception, the Class-level RCT criterion (C) is satisfied by virtue of their stronger design.",

        "analysis": "Next, we consider whether the paper used an exam-based assessment. The authors explicitly mention: “...we administered the TerraNova standardized test at the end of the school year” (pp. 5–6). They also describe TerraNova as having “well-established and reputable psychometric qualities” (p. 5). They thus employed a standardized, widely recognized exam rather than a custom-made test.\n\nThis meets the requirement for an exam-based assessment (E), since TerraNova is a standard assessment widely used in multiple contexts. The study did not rely on a researcher-designed test solely aligned to the intervention.\n\nHence, the exam-based assessment criterion is clearly fulfilled.",

In this study, the authors indicate the intervention was implemented for a full school year: “Teachers used ASSISTments with a new cohort of seventh-grade students during the second school year. Scores from this second cohort ... were used ... at the end of seventh-grade.” (pp. 3–4). This intervention period, which spanned most or all of the academic year, far exceeds a single term.\n\nMoreover, teachers had a ‘warm-up year’ and then a subsequent year in which student outcomes were measured. This well exceeds the minimal requirement of a one-term duration. Therefore, T is satisfied.\n\nNo quotes suggest a shorter intervention window. Instead, the study covers an entire seventh-grade academic cycle with professional development starting the summer before the school year. Thus, T is met.",

The authors note: “As discussed, schools were placed into pairs with similar prior achievement levels ... and pairs were randomly assigned to treatment and control.” (p. 6). Further, Table 1 (p. 4) shows demographics (FRL status, race, special education) for students in the sample. They also confirm that control schools “continued with existing homework practices” (pp. 2–3).\n\nWe see that the control group’s baseline performance was documented through prior-year NECAP math and reading scores (e.g., p. 7, describing baseline equivalence). The paper clarifies that the control teachers did not receive ASSISTments training or support and merely followed normal homework policies.\n\nHence, the control group is well documented: Table 1 includes student demographic data, and the authors confirm they used “business-as-usual” approaches.

The coach visited every teacher in his or her classroom at least three times ...
