abstract: >-
  This paper presents results from a large-scale randomized evaluation of the One
  Laptop per Child program, using data collected after 15 months of implementation
  in 318 primary schools in rural Peru. The program increased the ratio of computers
  per student from 0.12 to 1.18 in treatment schools. This expansion in access
  translated into substantial increases in use of computers both at school and at
  home. No evidence is found of effects on test scores in math and language. There
  is some evidence, though inconclusive, about positive effects on general cognitive
  skills.

      The study randomized at the school level, which inherently includes class-level
      randomization.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We implemented a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at the school level,
      as this is the level of intervention of the OLPC program." (p. 300)

      2) "The process to determine the study sample started with the list of schools
      prioritized by the government." (p. 300)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study randomized entire schools, which is a stronger design than class-level
      randomization. Since schools encompass multiple classes, randomizing at the
      school level ensures that all classes within a school are assigned to either the
      treatment or control group, preventing cross-group contamination within a school.
      The ERCT Standard’s ‘C’ criterion requires class-level randomization to avoid
      contamination, and school-level randomization satisfies this by default as it
      inherently includes all classes within the randomized unit.

      The criterion is met because randomization at the school level exceeds the
      minimum requirement of class-level randomization.

      The assessments were custom-made for the study, not widely recognized
      standardized exams.
    quote: >
      "We applied achievement tests in math and reading constructed by the
      educational expert on the research team separately for the three mentioned
      groups, using items drawn from previous national standardized examinations."

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The main study outcomes include academic achievement in math and
      language and cognitive skills as measured by Raven’s Progressive Matrices, a
      verbal fluency test, and a coding test." (p. 296)

      2) "We applied achievement tests in math and reading constructed by the
      educational expert on the research team separately for the three mentioned
      groups, using items drawn from previous national standardized examinations."
      (p. 304)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires the use of standardized, widely recognized exams,
      not custom tests designed for the study. Although the math and reading tests
      incorporated items from previous national standardized examinations, they were
      constructed by the research team specifically for this evaluation, making them
      bespoke assessments rather than a pre-existing, broadly accepted standardized
      test. The cognitive tests (Raven’s Progressive Matrices, verbal fluency, and
      coding) are recognized in psychological research but are not standardized
      educational exams covering core academic subjects as required.

      The criterion is not met because the assessments were custom-made, not widely
      recognized standardized exams.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The intervention lasted approximately 15 months, exceeding the minimum
      requirement of one academic term.
    quote: >
      "Extensive data collected after about 15 months of implementation are used to
      test whether increased computer access affected human capital accumulation."

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The intervention was implemented between April and November 2009, and
      on average, laptops were delivered around August 2009." (p. 301)

      2) "Extensive data collected after about 15 months of implementation are used
      to test whether increased computer access affected human capital
      accumulation." (p. 296)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard defines a term as approximately 3-4 months, and the ‘T’
      criterion requires the intervention to last at least one full academic term. The
      study reports that laptops were delivered around August 2009, with data
      collected in October-November 2010, indicating a duration of about 15 months.
      This exceeds the minimum term length, providing ample time to assess
      meaningful impacts beyond short-term effects.

      The criterion is met because the 15-month duration surpasses the term
      requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The control group must be well-documented. Documentation should include
      demographic information, baseline performance, and any treatments received."
      (ERCT Standard)

      2) "Table 1 shows summary statistics from administrative records for all
      schools in Peru, those prioritized by the government for the intervention, and
      the original and final research samples." (p. 301)

      3) "Panel A presents statistics on school inputs and student characteristics
      constructed from the 2007 school census. Panel B reports statistics
      constructed from the 2008 second grade national standardized examination."
      (p. 301)

      4) "Results indicate that observable characteristics of schools in the final
      research sample are similar to those of schools in the original research sample
      and to the set of schools prioritized by the government for the program."
      (p. 301)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard mandates detailed documentation of the control group,
      including demographics, baseline performance, and treatments received. The
      paper provides this through Table 1, which includes school and student
      characteristics (e.g., rural status, enrollment, overage students) from the 2007
      census and baseline test scores from the 2008 national exam for the control
      group. The control group received no laptops during the study, maintaining a
      business-as-usual condition, which is implicitly clear from the design.

      The criterion is met due to the comprehensive documentation of the control
      group’s characteristics and baseline data.

      The study randomized entire schools to treatment and control groups.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We implemented a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at the school level,
      as this is the level of intervention of the OLPC program." (p. 300)

      2) "Two-thirds of schools were selected for treatment, and the remainder was
      assigned to the control group." (p. 300)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ‘S’ criterion requires randomization at the school level, which the study
      explicitly confirms by stating that the RCT was conducted at the school level.
      Schools were randomly assigned to treatment (receiving laptops) or control (no
      laptops), with two-thirds in treatment and one-third in control, stratified by
      region and other factors. This design aligns with the ERCT requirement for
      school-level randomization to capture real-world implementation effects.

      The criterion is met as the study clearly randomized entire schools.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study did not use standardized exams for all main subjects, only assessing
      math and language.
    quote: >
      "We applied achievement tests in math and reading constructed by the
      educational expert on the research team." (p. 304)

      2) "We applied achievement tests in math and reading constructed by the
      educational expert on the research team." (p. 304)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ‘A’ criterion requires standardized exams assessing all core subjects taught
      in the school, not just selected areas, and depends on criterion ‘E’ being met
      (standardized exams). The study tested only math and language, omitting other
      primary school subjects like science or social studies. Moreover, since
      criterion ‘E’ is not met (custom tests were used, not standardized ones), ‘A’
      cannot be satisfied regardless of subject coverage.

      The criterion is not met because the study did not assess all main subjects with
      standardized exams.
  y:
    met: true

      The intervention lasted approximately 15 months, exceeding the minimum
      requirement of one academic year.

      2) "The intervention was implemented between April and November 2009, and
      on average, laptops were delivered around August 2009." (p. 301)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ‘Y’ criterion requires an intervention duration of at least one academic
      year (typically 9-10 months). The study’s timeline, with laptops delivered
      around August 2009 and data collected after about 15 months (October-November
      2010), indicates a duration well beyond one year. This satisfies the requirement
      for a year-long intervention to assess sustained effects.

      The criterion is met as the 15-month duration exceeds one academic year.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The control group did not receive equivalent resources to match the laptops
      provided to the treatment group.
    quote: >
      "The intervention generated a substantial increase in computer use both at
      school and at home." (p. 318)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The control group must balance time on education and budget. If the
      intervention increases time or budget, the control group should match this for
      'business as usual' activities." (ERCT Standard)

      2) "The intervention generated a substantial increase in computer use both at
      school and at home." (p. 318)

      3) "There were 1.18 computers per student in the treatment group, compared
      with 0.12 in control schools at follow-up." (p. 296)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ‘B’ criterion requires that if the intervention group receives additional
      resources (time, budget, materials), the control group must receive equivalent
      resources for business-as-usual activities, unless the extra resources are the
      treatment variable. Here, the treatment group received laptops (a significant
      resource increase), raising the computer-to-student ratio from 0.12 to 1.18,
      while the control group did not receive equivalent resources or additional
      educational time. The study tests the effect of laptop provision, but the
      control group’s lack of compensatory resources creates an imbalance, making it
      unclear if effects stem from laptops or just increased resources.

      The criterion is not met because the control group lacked equivalent resources.

      The study did not track students until graduation, only following them for 15

      2) "Extensive data collected after about 15 months of implementation are used
      to test whether increased computer access affected human capital
      accumulation." (p. 296)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ‘G’ criterion mandates tracking students until graduation from their
      educational stage (e.g., primary school) to assess long-term impacts. The study
      followed students for 15 months, from laptop delivery (August 2009) to data
      collection (October-November 2010), covering second, followed cohort (mostly
      fourth), and sixth graders. However, primary education in Peru spans six grades
      (ages 6-11), and there’s no indication of tracking until graduation (e.g., sixth
      grade completion for all participants), which could take several years beyond
      15 months.

      The criterion is not met as the study did not track students until graduation.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study has not been independently replicated by a different research team.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study must be independently replicated." (ERCT Standard)

      2) No mention of replication in the paper.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ‘R’ criterion requires independent replication by a different research team
      in a different context. The paper, published in 2017, does not reference any
      replication studies, and no external evidence of replication is provided within
      the document. While it cites related studies (e.g., Beuermann et al. 2015),
      these are not replications of this specific RCT in rural Peru but separate
      evaluations of OLPC.

      The criterion is not met due to the absence of independent replication.
  i:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The study was conducted by researchers independent of the intervention
      designers.
    quote: >
      "This paper presents results from a large-scale randomized evaluation of
      OLPC." (p. 296)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study must be conducted independently from the authors who designed
      the intervention." (ERCT Standard)

      2) "This paper presents results from a large-scale randomized evaluation of
      OLPC." (p. 296)

      3) "The authors are from the Inter-American Development Bank and other
      institutions." (p. 295)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ‘I’ criterion requires the study to be conducted by researchers not involved
      in designing the intervention. The OLPC program was developed by the OLPC
      Foundation (originating at MIT), while the authors are affiliated with the
      Inter-American Development Bank and other independent entities. They
      evaluated an existing program, not one they created, maintaining independence
      from the intervention’s design.

      The criterion is met as the researchers were independent evaluators.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study protocol was not pre-registered before data collection began.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The full study protocol must be pre-registered before the study begins."
      (ERCT Standard)

      2) No mention of pre-registration in the paper.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ‘P’ criterion requires pre-registration of the study protocol (hypotheses,
      methods, analyses) before data collection starts. The paper, detailing an
      intervention from 2009-2010, provides no evidence of pre-registration (e.g., no
      registry link or date prior to August 2009). In 2009, pre-registration was less
      common, and its absence here suggests it was not done.

      The criterion is not met as there is no evidence of pre-registration.
