  This paper presents results from a large-scale randomized evaluation of
  the One Laptop per Child program, using data collected after 15 months
  of implementation in 318 primary schools in rural Peru. The program
  increased the ratio of computers per student from 0.12 to 1.18 in
  treatment schools. This expansion in access translated into substantial
  increases in use of computers both at school and at home. No evidence is
  found of effects on test scores in math and language. There is some
  evidence, though inconclusive, about positive effects on general cognitive
  skills.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We implemented a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at the school level,
      as this is the level of intervention of the OLPC program."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomization occurred at the school level, which satisfies the requirement
      for class-level randomization and exceeds it. Under the ERCT Standard,
      school-level randomization automatically meets the class-level criterion.

      Final sentence: This criterion is met as randomization was conducted at the
      school level, which is stronger than class-level RCT.
    explanation: >
      Randomization was performed at the school level, exceeding the class-level
      requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We applied achievement tests in math and reading constructed by the
      educational expert on the research team separately for the three mentioned
      groups, using items drawn from previous national standardized examinations."

      Detailed Analysis:

      The follow-up measures of academic achievement were custom tests designed
      by the authors using items from previous standardized exams, not official
      recognized tests. Under the ERCT Standard, criterion E requires the use of a
      widely recognized standardized exam, not custom instruments.

      Final sentence: This criterion is not met as the study used custom-designed
      tests rather than an official standardized exam.
    explanation: >
      The study used custom-designed tests rather than a recognized standardized
      exam.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The main data used in this paper were collected during October and
      November 2010, after about 15 months of program implementation."

      Detailed Analysis:

      The primary outcome measures were collected after roughly 15 months
      of implementation, exceeding the minimum of one full academic term
      (typically 3–4 months). Thus, the study satisfies the requirement
      for term-long follow-up.

      Final sentence: This criterion is met because outcomes were measured at
      least one term after the intervention began.
    explanation: >
      Outcomes were measured about 15 months after the intervention start,
      exceeding one academic term.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The resulting sample includes 318 schools, 209 treatments, and
      109 controls."

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper clearly documents the size and composition of the control
      group (109 schools) and states that these schools received no laptops,
      providing a proper baseline comparison.

      Final sentence: This criterion is met as the control group is well
      documented in terms of size and treatment received.
    explanation: >
      The control group’s size and treatment condition are clearly described,
      fulfilling documentation requirements.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We implemented a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at the school level,
      as this is the level of intervention of the OLPC program."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomization at the school level directly satisfies the school-level RCT
      criterion, ensuring assignments were made across entire institutions,
      not just classes.

      Final sentence: This criterion is met because entire schools were
      randomly assigned.
    explanation: >
      Entire schools, rather than individual classes, were randomized to
      treatment and control.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This paper presents results from a large-scale randomized evaluation of
      the One Laptop per Child program." (p. 296)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The OLPC initiative was created by the OLPC Foundation (MIT Media Lab),
      while this study was conducted and analyzed by a separate team from the
      Inter-American Development Bank and partner universities. There is no indication
      that the evaluation was carried out by the same individuals who designed the
      laptops or software, so implementation and analysis were truly independent.

      Final sentence: This criterion is met because the researchers evaluating the
      program were not the original designers of the intervention.
    explanation: >
      The evaluation was performed by an independent team (IDB and academic partners),
      distinct from the OLPC Foundation designers.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The main data used in this paper were collected during October and
      November 2010, after about 15 months of program implementation."

      Detailed Analysis:

      A follow-up period of approximately 15 months covers more than a full
      academic year, satisfying the Year-Duration requirement.

      Final sentence: This criterion is met as outcomes were tracked over at
      least one academic year.
    explanation: >
      Outcomes were measured 15 months post-start, satisfying the full
      academic year requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The program increased the ratio of computers per student from 0.12
      to 1.18 in treatment schools."
      2) "About 71 percent of teachers in the treatment group (7 percent of those in
      the control) attended a 40-hour training module aimed at facilitating the use
      of the laptops for pedagogical purposes."

      Detailed Analysis:

      The distribution of laptops and teacher training were integral parts of
      the intervention being tested. As these additional resources were the
      treatment variable, the control group’s standard condition is by design.

      Final sentence: This criterion is met because the extra resources were
      the core treatment variable.
    explanation: >
      Additional resources (laptops and training) were the treatment variable
      being tested, so the control condition appropriately remained business-as-usual.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Our results suggest that in the first two years of its implementation
      the program had no effects on math and reading scores." (Uruguay replication)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The original study did not report any independent replication.
      However, a separate RCT in Uruguay by de Melo et al. (2014) similarly found
      no impact on students’ math or reading outcomes, indicating the findings
      were reproducible.

      Final sentence: This criterion is met because the study's results were
      independently replicated.
    explanation: >
      An independent replication in Uruguay has confirmed the results.

      1) "The main study outcomes include academic achievement in math and
      language and cognitive skills as measured by Raven’s Progressive Matrices,
      a verbal fluency test, and a coding test."

      Detailed Analysis:

      Only math and language were assessed, without measuring impact on other
      core subjects, failing the all-subjects requirement.

      Final sentence: This criterion is not met because outcomes were measured
      in only two subjects.
    explanation: >
      Only math and language outcomes were assessed, not all main subjects.
    quote: >
      "The main study outcomes include academic achievement in math and

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The main data used in this paper were collected during October and

      2) "We use administrative and survey data on academic achievement and grade
      progression through 2019 ... student trajectories as they progress from primary
      school to university." (2024 follow-up)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The initial study followed students for 15 months; however, a 2024 follow-up
      by the researchers extended tracking through high school graduation.

      Final sentence: This criterion is met now that long-term outcomes were
      tracked through graduation.
    explanation: >
      A long-term follow-up study tracked student outcomes through graduation,
      meeting this criterion.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study does not mention any pre-registered protocol or registry ID prior to
      data collection.

      Final sentence: This criterion is not met because there is no evidence of
      a pre-registered protocol.
    explanation: >
      No statement of pre-registration is provided.
