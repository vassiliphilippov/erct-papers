  We partner text-messaging technology with school information systems to automate the gathering and provision of information to parents at scale. In a field experiment across 22 middle and high schools, we used this technology to send automated text-message alerts to parents about their child’s missed assignments, grades, and class absences. The intervention reduces course failures by 38% and increases class attendance by 17%. Students are more likely to be retained in the district. However, we do not find effects on standardized test scores. Our findings show that automated technology to inform parents can improve student effort relatively cheaply and at scale.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: "They randomized entire grades in each school, which is larger than a single class and thus meets or exceeds the class-level requirement."
    quote: "\"Random assignment was at the school-by-grade level… all school employees were blinded…\" (p. 10)"
    analysis: >-
      The authors clearly state that entire grades within each school were randomly assigned to either treatment or control, rather than individual students within a single class. This design helps reduce contamination and ensures that whole cohorts are assigned together. Because randomization was not done at the student level within a class, but rather at a larger unit, the study satisfies the class-level RCT criterion.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: "They used the Smarter Balanced standardized assessment for math and reading, which is an established exam-based measure."
    quote: "\"The standardized test scores are from the Smarter Balanced assessment, which is aligned to the Common Core…\" (p. 8)"
    analysis: >-
      The study employed the Smarter Balanced standardized test, a widely recognized assessment aligned with the Common Core standards. This ensures that the study used an externally validated, standardized measure rather than a researcher-designed assessment.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: "They ran the messaging intervention from late October to May, which is sufficiently long (spanning multiple months) to fulfill a typical academic term duration."
    quote: "\"The intervention ran between the end of October 2015 through the end of May…\" (p. 6)"
    analysis: >-
      The intervention lasted approximately seven months, from late October to May, covering most of the academic year. This exceeds the minimum threshold of a single academic term.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: "They document the control group’s baseline demographics, prior achievement, and standard practices used, confirming a well-described comparison group."
    quote: "\"Parents in the control group received the default level of information... This included report cards... phone calls home...\" (p. 6)"
    analysis: >-
      The control group followed business-as-usual practices, receiving only standard school communications. Baseline demographic and achievement characteristics were well documented, ensuring clear comparison.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: "Randomization was done by grade within each school, not by entire schools as required for S."
    quote: "\"Random assignment was at the school-by-grade level...\" (p. 10)"
    analysis: >-
      The study randomized entire grades within schools rather than randomizing entire schools. While stronger than class-level randomization, it does not meet the requirement for full school-level assignment.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: "They assessed only math and reading outcomes, with no coverage of other main subjects such as science or social studies."
    quote: "\"We received scaled standardized test scores for Math and ELA...\" (p. 8)"
    analysis: >-
      The study measured outcomes in math and English but did not assess other main subjects like science or social studies. Thus, it does not satisfy the AllExams requirement.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: "The intervention began around October and ended in late May, which is shorter than a full academic year (roughly 9–10 months)."
    quote: "\"The intervention ran between the end of October 2015 through the end of May when the school year was expected to conclude.\" (p. 6)"
    analysis: >-
      Although the intervention spanned most of the school year, it did not begin at the very start of the academic calendar. Thus, it does not fully meet the Year Duration requirement.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: "The intervention group received an added technology (text-message updates). No matching resource or budget/time was provided to the control group, so the control condition was not balanced in resources."
    quote: "\"The marginal cost of each text message is… $63 total… The control group did not receive text alerts.\" (pp. 3, 6)"
    analysis: >-
      The intervention introduced an additional technological resource (text alerts), but the control group did not receive an equivalent additional resource. While the cost was minimal, the lack of a balanced control condition means the requirement is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: "They only followed students through the end of that academic year and did not track them until any graduation milestone."
    quote: "\"The intervention ended in May 2016… We surveyed parents in June… No long-term follow-up.\" (pp. 2, 7)"
    analysis: >-
      The study only tracked students through the end of the academic year in which the intervention took place. It did not follow students through a full graduation milestone.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: "No independent replication is documented in the paper; they do not report another research team reproducing the same results."
    quote: "\"We helped design and implement an automated-text messaging program… We do not know if this intervention works in other contexts.\" (p. 22)"
    analysis: >-
      The study was not independently replicated by a separate research team, and no external verification is documented.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: "The lead researcher co-developed the intervention and previously received compensation from the LMS company, so it was not independently conducted."
    quote: "\"Bergman has previously received compensation from the learning management system company to design the technology…\" (p. 2)"
    analysis: >-
      The researcher had prior financial ties to the technology used in the study, indicating that the study was not conducted by an independent entity.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: "The paper does not reference any formal pre-registration or provide a registry ID prior to data collection."
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      No mention of a pre-registered protocol is found in the text, meaning the study was not pre-registered before data collection.
