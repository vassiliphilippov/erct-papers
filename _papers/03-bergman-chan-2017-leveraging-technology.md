abstract: >-
  While leveraging parents has the potential to increase student performance,
  programs that do so are often costly to implement or they target younger
  children. We partner text‐messaging technology with school information
  systems to automate the gathering and provision of information to parents at
  scale. In a field experiment across 22 middle and high schools, we used this
  technology to send automated text‐message alerts to parents about their
  child’s missed assignments, grades and class absences. We pre‐specified five
  primary outcomes. The intervention reduces course failures by 38% and
  increases class attendance by 17%. Students are more likely to be retained
  in the district. The positive effects are particularly large for students with
  below‐average GPA and students in high school. There are no effects on
  standardized test scores however. We randomly chose either the mother or
  the father to receive the alerts, but there were no differential effects 
  across these subgroups. As in previous research, the intervention appears to 
  change parents’ beliefs about their child’s performance and increases parent
  monitoring. Our results show that this type of automated technology can
  improve student effort relatively cheaply and at scale.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Random assignment was at the school‐by‐grade level to minimize the
      potential for spillovers into the control group.” (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The authors state that entire grade cohorts within each school were
      randomized, not individual students. This clustering at the grade‐by‐school
      level prevents contamination across treatment and control within the same
      classroom, satisfying the class‐level RCT requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met because the unit of
      randomisation is at or above the class level.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The standardized test scores are from the Smarter Balanced
      assessment, which is aligned to the Common Core.” (p. 12)

      2) “We received scaled standardized test scores for Math and ELA for
      2015 and 2016 examinations.” (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study uses the Smarter Balanced assessment, a widely recognized,
      state‐wide standardized exam aligned to the Common Core, for Math and
      English Language Arts. This fulfills the Exam‐based Assessment criterion.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is met because standardized
      exams were used.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The intervention ran between the end of October 2015 through the end
      of May when the school year was expected to conclude.” (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The text‐message intervention spanned the majority of the 2015–2016
      academic year, covering at least one full term (~semester equivalent).
      This meets the Term Duration requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met because the study covered
      a full academic term.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Parents in the control group received the default level of
      information that the schools and teachers provided. This included report
      cards that are sent home after each marking period every six to nine
      weeks along with parent‐teacher conferences and any phone calls home
      from teachers.” (p. 10)

      2) “Table 1 presents baseline summary statistics for the control group,
      the difference in means from the treatment group and the p‐value showing
      the statistical significance of these differences.” (p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The authors provide a clear description of the control group’s
      communications, baseline demographics and performance in Table 1,
      allowing proper comparison. This satisfies the Documented Control Group
      requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because control‐group
      details are fully documented.

      1) “Random assignment was at the school‐by‐grade level to minimize the
      potential for spillovers into the control group.” (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomisation occurred at the grade‐by‐school level, not at the whole
      school level. Multiple grades within the same school could be split
      between treatment and control, so the School‐level RCT criterion is not
      met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is not met because randomisation
      was below the whole‐school level.
    quote: >
      “Random assignment was at the school‐by‐grade level to minimize the
      potential for spillovers into the control group.” (p. 9)

      schools.

      Relevant Quotes:

      No quotes indicate use of an external, third‐party evaluator.

      Detailed Analysis:

      All aspects of design, implementation and analysis were conducted by
      the authors (and their LMS partner) with no independent evaluation
      reported. This introduces potential bias, violating the Independent
      Conduct requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is not met because no external
      evaluator was used.

      The study was designed, implemented, and analyzed by the same team
      without external evaluation.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study covers the full 2015–2016 academic year from fall through
      spring graduation. This satisfies the Year Duration requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is met because the study spanned
      an entire academic year.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Despite sending more than 32,000 text messages, the total cost of all
      of these messages was approximately $63. The gradebook and personnel
      training cost an additional $7 dollars per student.” (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The only extra input was low‐cost text messages and minimal training.
      No additional instructional time or budget was provided, so there is no
      imbalance of educational resources between treatment and control.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met because no extra resources
      were added beyond information delivery.

      1) Berlinski et al. (2021) – “Our 18-month intervention raised average 
      math scores by 0.09 of a standard deviation and increased the share of 
      students satisfying attendance requirements for grade promotion by 4.7 
      percentage points.”

      Detailed Analysis:

      An independent research team in Chile implemented a similar text-message 
      intervention for parents and found significant improvements in student 
      outcomes. This demonstrates that the original findings can 
      be reproduced by other researchers in a different context.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is met because at least one 
      independent replication has been conducted.

      standardized test scores for Math and ELA for 2015 and 2016
      examinations.” (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Only Math and English Language Arts were assessed via standardized
      exams. Other core subjects (e.g., science, social studies) were not
      measured, so the All‑subject Exams criterion is not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because not all
      subjects were assessed.

      Relevant Quotes:

      No quotes indicate follow‑up beyond the end of the school year.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study tracks participants only through May of the intervention year.
      No data are collected through graduation, so the Graduation Tracking
      criterion is not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is not met because no tracking
      continued to graduation.

      Participants were tracked only through the end of the school year, not
      until graduation.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “We pre-registered our analysis plan, subgroups of interest, and 
      primary outcomes prior to obtaining outcome data.”

      Detailed Analysis:

      The authors explicitly state that they pre-registered their analysis 
      plan and specified primary outcomes before collecting the outcome data. 
      This indicates that a study protocol was established in advance, 
      satisfying the Pre-registered Protocol criterion.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is met because the study was 
      pre-registered before data collection.
    quote: >
      “We pre-registered our analysis plan, subgroups of interest, and primary 
      outcomes prior to obtaining outcome data.” (footnote 1)
    explanation: >
      The study’s analysis plan and outcomes were publicly pre-registered 
      before data collection began.
