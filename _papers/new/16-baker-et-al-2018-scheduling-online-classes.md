abstract: >
  Through a randomized control trial of students in a for-credit online course
  at a public 4-year university, this paper tests the efficacy of a scheduling
  intervention aimed at improving students’ time management. While the
  intervention initially improved quiz scores for students with lower
  self-reported time management skills, those early positive effects did not
  persist over the full 5-week term. The study discusses potential mechanisms,
  including procrastination and cramming, though no strong effects on these
  behaviors were found. Overall, the results suggest that simple scheduling
  prompts may briefly enhance performance but may not sustain long-term gains if
  they are discontinued.

erct_level: 0
rct: true
criteria:
  c:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Randomization occurred at the individual-student level, not at the class or
      school level, and the personal-tutoring exception does not apply.
    quote: >
      “We employ a randomized control trial ... We randomly assigned students into
      treatment and control groups.” (p. 6)
    analysis: >
      First Paragraph: The ERCT ‘C’ criterion requires that randomization occur at
      the class level (or at least not student-level within the same classroom)
      unless an approved exception applies (e.g., personal tutoring). In the paper,
      the authors state: “We employ a randomized control trial testing the effects
      of a ... scheduling intervention on course achievement ... We randomly
      assigned students into treatment and control groups.” (p. 6). Here,
      randomization is clearly done at the individual student level within a
      single online course.
      
      Second Paragraph: The authors do not mention randomizing entire classes or
      multiple sections. Instead, they note: “A total of 176 students enrolled ...
      157 students were randomly assigned” (pp. 7–8). This indicates the random
      assignment was effectively ‘student-by-student’ in one course.
      
      Third Paragraph: The ERCT standard’s exception for individualized tutoring
      or personal one-to-one instruction does not apply here, because this is not a
      one-on-one tutoring program. It is an email-based scheduling prompt delivered
      to each student in an online lecture course. There is no evidence that the
      entire class or entire schools were assigned as units; hence contamination
      remains possible within the same class if students discussed their scheduling
      practice.
      
      Conclusion Paragraph: Because this was a student-level RCT in a single class,
      and no valid exception applies, the requirement that entire classes (or
      schools) be randomized is not satisfied. Therefore, criterion C is not met.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Only instructor-created or course-specific quizzes were used, rather than a
      recognized standardized exam.
    quote: >
      “We focus our analyses on the weekly quiz scores and final course grade as
      opposed to the daily homework scores... we find positive treatment effects on
      initial quiz grades.” (pp. 11–12)
    analysis: >
      First Paragraph: The ‘E’ criterion requires use of a standardized exam-based
      assessment. In this study, the main outcomes are weekly quiz scores and the
      final course grade. The authors report the effect of encouraging students to
      schedule their coursework on academic performance.
      
      Second Paragraph: There is no indication that these assessments are
      externally validated standardized tests. Instead, the quizzes and exam
      appear to be designed by the course instructors.
      
      Third Paragraph: Since no evidence shows the use of a widely recognized
      standardized test, the study does not fulfill the Exam-based Assessment
      requirement. Therefore, criterion E is not met.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The intervention lasted only 5 weeks in a summer course, which is shorter than
      a standard academic term.
    quote: >
      “We conducted our study in an online undergraduate STEM course lasting 5
      weeks in a selective, public 4-year university.” (p. 8)
    analysis: >
      First Paragraph: The ‘T’ criterion requires that the intervention be
      implemented for at least one full academic term (typically 3–4 months). In
      this paper, the course was a 5-week summer class.
      
      Second Paragraph: The authors emphasize the short duration of the course,
      which is well below the standard academic term length.
      
      Third Paragraph: Because the entire study spanned only 5 weeks, it does not
      satisfy the minimum term duration requirement. Therefore, criterion T is not
      met.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      They present baseline demographics, performance, and a clear description of
      control group activities (placebo survey).
    quote: >
      “A total of 176 students enrolled in this course ... 157 students were
      randomly assigned... The control students received an email ... The authors
      tested for baseline equivalences (Table 1).” (pp. 7–10)
    analysis: >
      First Paragraph: Criterion D requires that the control group be well-documented
      with demographic information, baseline performance, and conditions. The
      authors provide a thorough description of how the control group was assigned.
      
      Second Paragraph: Detailed baseline characteristics for both groups are
      provided, including age, SAT scores, race/ethnicity, and self-reported time
      management measures.
      
      Third Paragraph: The control group’s environment is described, confirming a
      business-as-usual condition. Hence, criterion D is met.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      They randomized individual students, not entire schools, so the design does
      not satisfy school-level RCT.
    quote: >
      “We randomly assigned 157 students who were enrolled in the online class into
      treatment or control groups.” (p. 8)
    analysis: >
      First Paragraph: ‘S’ requires that entire schools be randomized. In this
      study, randomization occurred within a single online class.
      
      Second Paragraph: There is no mention of multiple schools or entire
      institutions being assigned to different arms.
      
      Third Paragraph: Therefore, since randomization is at the student level,
      criterion S is not met.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      They exclusively assessed performance in one STEM course and did not test all
      main subjects.
    quote: >
      “Our outcomes are weekly quiz scores and final course grade in an online STEM
      class.” (p. 2)
    analysis: >
      First Paragraph: The ‘A’ criterion requires measuring the impact on all main
      subjects. The authors focus solely on one course’s performance.
      
      Second Paragraph: This single-course setting limits assessment to one subject,
      excluding other academic domains.
      
      Third Paragraph: Thus, the AllExams requirement is not fulfilled, and
      criterion A is not met.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Implementation only covered 5 weeks in summer, not a full academic year.
    quote: >
      “The course was in the summer term ... Each is only 5 weeks long.” (p. 8)
    analysis: >
      First Paragraph: ‘Y’ requires the study to last at least one academic year.
      The paper repeatedly notes that the course spanned only 5 weeks.
      
      Second Paragraph: Five weeks is far shorter than the typical academic year.
      
      Third Paragraph: Therefore, criterion Y is not satisfied.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      No significant resource difference existed; both groups received identical
      instructor contacts and extra credit opportunities.
    quote: >
      “In order to ensure ... control students had an equal number of contacts from
      the instructor ... The control students received an email with a survey about
      web browsers...” (p. 9)
    analysis: >
      First Paragraph: Criterion B requires equivalent extra resources for both
      groups if the treatment group receives additional advantages. In this study,
      both groups received similar instructor contacts and extra credit.
      
      Second Paragraph: The control group received a placebo survey ensuring
      balanced conditions.
      
      Third Paragraph: Thus, criterion B is met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      They only measured outcomes within a 5-week window and did not follow students
      until graduation.
    quote: >
      “We observe no statistically significant difference between the control and
      treatment groups ... and no difference in overall course scores.” (p. 14)
    analysis: >
      First Paragraph: Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation.
      This study only reports data from the 5-week course.
      
      Second Paragraph: There is no follow-up after the course ends.
      
      Third Paragraph: Hence, the Graduation Tracking requirement is not met.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      No mention of a separate independent replication by different researchers in
      another context.
    quote: >
      “Although many studies have previously explored ... The three prior studies took
      place in MOOCs ... The current study extends these contexts.” (pp. 3–5)
    analysis: >
      First Paragraph: Criterion R requires that the intervention be replicated
      independently by a different team. The authors reference prior studies but do
      not indicate an independent replication.
      
      Second Paragraph: The current study is conducted by the same team that
      developed the scheduling intervention.
      
      Third Paragraph: Therefore, criterion R is not met.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The authors themselves designed and delivered the intervention, with no
      external group conducting the study.
    quote: >
      “The goal of this paper is to test the efficacy of a scheduling intervention in
      an online postsecondary course. We employ a randomized control trial ...” (p.
      2)
    analysis: >
      First Paragraph: Criterion I requires that the study be conducted by
      researchers independent of the intervention’s original designers.
      
      Second Paragraph: Here, the same group that designed the scheduling prompt
      also implemented and analyzed the study.
      
      Third Paragraph: Thus, the Independent Conduct criterion is not met.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The authors do not mention any formal pre-registration or registry entry made
      prior to data collection.
    quote: null
    analysis: >
      First Paragraph: Criterion P requires that the study be pre-registered
      before data collection.
      
      Second Paragraph: No registration ID or statement is provided.
      
      Third Paragraph: Therefore, the Pre-Registered criterion is not met.
