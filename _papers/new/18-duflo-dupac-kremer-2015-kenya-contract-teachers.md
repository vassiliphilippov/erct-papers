abstract: >-
  This paper investigates a program under which randomly selected Kenyan schools
  were funded to hire an additional contract teacher, outside of the normal
  civil-service channels, alongside a parallel governance intervention that
  empowered parents in the hiring and monitoring process. The authors examine
  whether extra teachers and local governance reforms can work as complements
  in improving test scores and reducing class size. Results show a positive
  effect on test scores only for pupils assigned to locally hired contract
  teachers, especially when parents were formally empowered to supervise them.
  However, these short-term gains faded out once the intervention ended.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They conducted a randomized assignment of entire schools to the Extra
      Teacher Program, which meets or exceeds class-level RCT requirements.
    quote: >-
      “The ETP program provided 70 randomly selected school committees with funds
      to hire an additional teacher…We set up an experiment…” (pp. 93-94)
    analysis: >-
      The paper describes random assignment of entire schools to receive the
      Extra Teacher Program (ETP) or serve as a control. The key randomization
      was at the school level, which is acceptable or stronger. Therefore,
      criterion C is met.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They used a study-specific math and literacy test, not a widely recognized
      external standardized exam.
    quote: >-
      “Standardized tests covering math and literacy questions… were administered
      in all schools after 5 school terms… [T]rained enumerators and a separate
      team graded them.” (p. 97)
    analysis: >-
      Although tests were administered, they appear to be researcher-created
      rather than a widely recognized external exam. Thus, criterion E is not met.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They implemented the program for at least 18 months, easily surpassing the
      minimum term requirement.
    quote: >-
      “All but two of the 70 schools… had a contract teacher in place by early May
      2005… data on test scores were collected in November 2006…” (pp. 94, 97)
    analysis: >-
      The program spanned from May 2005 through November 2006, covering multiple
      school terms and lasting over a year and a half. Thus, criterion T is met.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They clearly described the control group’s composition, baseline data, and
      normal teaching practices.
    quote: >-
      “Background data… was collected in 2004… The 210 schools were randomly divided…
      70 schools formed the comparison group.” (p. 94, Table 1)
    analysis: >-
      The control group is well documented with baseline characteristics and usual
      practices. This satisfies criterion D.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They assigned entire schools to the program or control condition,
      satisfying school-level randomization.
    quote: >-
      “We set up an experiment… The ETP program provided 70 randomly selected school
      committees with funds… out of 210.” (pp. 93-94)
    analysis: >-
      Since the unit of randomization was the entire school, the study meets
      criterion S.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They only measured math and literacy outcomes, not all main subjects in the
      curriculum.
    quote: >-
      “Standardized tests covering math and literacy questions…we find large
      differences… we do not see mention of science or other subjects.” (p. 97)
    analysis: >-
      Focusing solely on math and literacy, the study did not assess other core
      subjects; thus, criterion A is not met.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They ran the program for roughly 18–19 months, clearly exceeding one school
      year.
    quote: >-
      “ETP was implemented… from May 2005 through November 2006, covering at least 3
      school terms or more.” (pp. 94, 97)
    analysis: >-
      With the intervention lasting over a year and a half, criterion Y is met.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Only the ETP schools received funds to hire contract teachers, with no
      corresponding resource for the control schools.
    quote: >-
      “…the control group continued under standard instruction with no additional
      teacher… (class size ~82) whereas the ETP group hired an extra teacher…” (pp.
      92, 96)
    analysis: >-
      The imbalance in resources between treatment and control groups means that
      criterion B is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They tested students at 19 months and then a year later, but did not track
      them until primary school graduation.
    quote: >-
      “The same tests were administered again… one year after the program ended
      (November 2007).” (p. 99) No mention of following them through primary
      completion.
    analysis: >-
      Without tracking students until the end of primary school, criterion G is not
      satisfied.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They reference related studies but do not report an independent replication by
      a separate research team.
    quote: >-
      “A separate set of schools were chosen for an alternative… (p. 94) … We also
      note Muralidharan & Sundararaman (2013) in India, but that is not an explicit
      replication.”
    analysis: >-
      The study lacks evidence of an independent replication; thus, criterion R is
      not met.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The authors led the design and analysis without an independent external team.
    quote: >-
      “We set up an experiment… ICS staff met with the headmaster… but the authors
      appear to lead design and research.” (p. 93)
    analysis: >-
      With the same team handling design and analysis, there is no independent
      conduct, so criterion I is not satisfied.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No mention is made of any pre-registration or a publicly accessible analysis
      plan.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      The absence of a pre-registered protocol means that criterion P is not met.
