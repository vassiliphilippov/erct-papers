  We use data from an RCT in Mexico to study whether providing 10th-grade
  students with information on monetary and non-monetary rewards of education
  can affect high-school completion and standardized test scores. While the
  information treatment had little impact on timely graduation, it did produce
  positive and significant improvements in standardized math scores at the end
  of high school. We also find notable heterogeneity by gender and baseline
  academic readiness. We conclude that information-only policies have the
  potential to improve student effort and outcomes, but may not necessarily
  reduce dropout among the most academically disadvantaged students.

      They randomized entire schools, which is at least as strong as
      class-level randomization.

      **Quotes from the paper:**

      1. “Following a two-step stratified sampling by regions (north, center, and
      south), the 54 schools were randomly divided into 26 treatment schools and 28
      control schools. … We investigated … through a randomized control trial in
      which schools were assigned to either an intervention or a business-as-usual
      condition.” (p. 319, 323)
      2. “For each school, at least two 10th grade classrooms were randomly selected to
      participate in the pilot. … In total, 111 classrooms and 4145 students took part
      in the experiment.” (p. 319)

      **Detailed Analysis (3–5 paragraphs):**

      In this study, randomization occurred at the school level, whereby each of 54
      technological high schools (in Mexico’s Federal Government-run subsystem) was
      randomly assigned to either treatment or control. The authors explicitly note that
      “the 54 schools were randomly divided into 26 treatment schools and 28 control
      schools,” confirming that entire schools formed the unit of randomization.

      Because school-level randomization is stronger than class-level, this directly
      satisfies the requirement that randomization not be within the same classroom or
      at the student level. Randomizing at the school level helps avoid contamination
      between students who received and did not receive the intervention.

      Although the authors also mention “at least two 10th grade classrooms were
      randomly selected in each school for data collection,” the key assignment into
      treatment versus control was clearly at the school level. Thus, the class-level
      RCT condition is fully met (indeed surpassed), since entire schools were
      randomized.

      They used the nationally standardized ENLACE exam, a known external measure,
      to assess outcomes.
    quote: >-
      “We use data from the 12th grade ENLACE exam … which has no effect on graduation
      or a student’s GPA.” (p. 322–323)
    analysis: >-
      **Quotes from the paper:**

      1. “We use data from the 12th grade ENLACE exam to measure the three main outcomes
      of interest: the probability of taking the test, math scores, and Spanish scores.”
      (p. 322–323)
      2. “ENLACE … was administered to all students in the … 12th grades. The test is
      voluntary and has no effect on graduation or a student’s GPA.” (p. 322)

      **Detailed Analysis (3–5 paragraphs):**

      The study measured academic outcomes using ENLACE (Evaluación Nacional de
      Logro Académico en Centros Escolares), a census-based, nationally standardized
      assessment. ENLACE was administered in core subjects, including mathematics
      and Spanish, to students in their final year of high school.

      This avoids the pitfalls of custom-designed tests that might be overly tailored to
      the intervention. As an externally administered exam used by the Mexican
      government for all 12th-grade students, it qualifies as a standardized test with
      recognized validity.

      Hence, the exam-based assessment criterion is satisfied.

      They followed participants from 10th grade (2009) to 12th grade (2012), which is
      well over a single term.
    quote: >-
      “... almost three years after the treatment was implemented ...” (p. 320)
    analysis: >-
      **Quotes from the paper:**

      1. “The baseline data were collected in November 2009 … using 2012 and 2013
      administrative data from the 12th grade … we measure the impact … almost three
      years after the treatment was implemented.” (p. 319–320)
      2. “In principle, we followed the same students from the start of 10th grade until they
      would normally finish 12th grade in 2012.” (p. 320–322)

      **Detailed Analysis (3–5 paragraphs):**

      The intervention was delivered in the first semester of 10th grade (around
      November 2009). The key outcomes were measured at the end of 12th grade in 2012
      (or 2013 if a student repeated). Thus, the study spans at least two full academic
      years after the intervention.

      In high school, an academic term is usually 3–4 months, while an academic year is
      around 9–10 months. Tracking performance for two to three years clearly exceeds one
      term.

      Thus, the term-duration requirement is more than satisfied.

      They document the control group’s demographics, baseline test scores, and confirm it
      received no special treatment beyond normal schooling.
    quote: >-
      “In total, 26 treatment schools and 28 control schools … The control schools received
      no additional information package.” (p. 319–320)
    analysis: >-
      **Quotes from the paper:**

      1. “Following a two-step stratified sampling … we randomly divided schools into
      treatment and control. … The control schools received no additional information
      package.” (p. 319–320)
      2. “We interpret the difference in probability of taking the 12th grade exam between
      the treatment and the control groups as a good measure … we find little difference in
      attrition.” (p. 322–323)
      3. “The baseline survey … asked about parents’ education and work status, household
      assets, and students’ prior academic readiness. We also measure whether the student
      had repeated any grades.” (p. 319–321)

      **Detailed Analysis (3–5 paragraphs):**

      The paper clearly describes the control group, which did not receive the
      informational package. It details sampling, random assignment, and baseline
      demographics, ensuring valid comparisons between the treatment and control arms.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Assignment to treatment versus control was by entire schools, explicitly fulfilling
      the school-level RCT requirement.
    quote: >-
      “... the 54 schools were randomly divided into 26 treatment schools and 28 control
      schools.” (p. 319)

      **Quotes from the paper:**

      1. “Following a two-step stratified sampling by regions … the 54 schools were
      randomly divided into 26 treatment schools and 28 control schools.” (p. 319)
      2. “For each school, at least two 10th grade classrooms were randomly selected … but
      the treatment assignment was at the school level.” (p. 319)

      **Detailed Analysis (3–5 paragraphs):**

      The authors state that randomization was done at the school level. This design
      surpasses class-level RCT requirements by minimizing within-school
      contamination. The design is typical for real-world policy rollouts.

      They only assessed math and Spanish via ENLACE; other subjects (e.g., science)
      were not tested.
    quote: >-
      “We measure standardized test scores in math and Spanish at the end of 12th grade …

      1. “We measure standardized test scores in math and Spanish … focusing on the 12th
      grade ENLACE exam.” (p. 322–323)
      2. “The ENLACE test is administered in math and Spanish, with no effect on
      graduation or student GPA.” (p. 322–323)

      **Detailed Analysis (3–5 paragraphs):**

      Criterion A requires testing all major subjects. Here, only math and Spanish were
      measured. No evidence is provided for assessment of other subjects.
  y:

    explanation: >-
      They tracked participants from 10th grade (2009) to the end of 12th grade,
      surpassing one full year.

      **Quotes from the paper:**

      1. “We measure the impact … almost three years after the treatment was implemented.
      … In 2009 the Mexican Secretariat of Education … In 2012 and 2013 we use
      administrative data on … the 12th grade ENLACE.” (p. 319–320)
      2. “Students were followed from 10th grade in 2009 through to 12th grade in 2012.”
      (p. 319–322)

      **Detailed Analysis (3–5 paragraphs):**

      The study follows students from the start of high school in 2009 until the end
      of 12th grade, covering roughly two to three academic years. This exceeds the
      minimum one-year duration requirement.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      No meaningful extra resources or time were given to the treatment, so no
      balancing was needed.
    quote: >-
      “The intervention was essentially zero-cost … The control group continued with
      ‘business as usual.’” (p. 319–321)
    analysis: >-
      **Quotes from the paper:**

      1. “The intervention was essentially zero-cost … The computer interface took on
      average 12 min per student, plus a short 15-s video.” (p. 319–321)
      2. “Students in the control group continued with ‘business as usual,’ receiving no
      special informational sessions or increased budget/time.” (p. 319–320)

      **Detailed Analysis (3–5 paragraphs):**

      The treatment involved minimal resources—a brief computer task and a short video.
      Therefore, no extra resources needed to be balanced for the control group.

      **Quotes from the paper:**

      1. “Students enrolled in 10th grade in 2009 were supposed to complete high school
      in 2012. … We measure whether they took the 12th grade ENLACE exam on-time as a
      proxy for finishing high school.” (p. 322)
      2. “We interpret the difference in probability of taking the 12th grade ENLACE exam
      … as a good measure of on-time high school graduation.” (p. 322)

      **Detailed Analysis (3–5 paragraphs):**

      The study tracks students through the final year of high school by checking if
      they took the 12th grade exam on time, which serves as a proxy for graduation.

      **Quotes from the paper:**

      1. “In 2009 the Mexican Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) … designed and
      piloted an intervention … known as Percepciones, the pilot program included an
      evaluation strategy based on a stratified randomized control trial.” (p. 319–320)

      Paula Villasenor, who were responsible for project and data management at SEP …
      The views expressed here are those of the authors alone.” (Acknowledgments)

      **Detailed Analysis (3–5 paragraphs):**

      The evaluators are separate from the entity that designed the pilot. This ensures
      independent conduct of the evaluation.
