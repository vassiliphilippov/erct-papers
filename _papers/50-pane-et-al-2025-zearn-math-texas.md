abstract: >-
  Zearn Math is a popular software platform for K-8 mathematics learning,
  designed to enable all students to successfully access grade-level content.
  RAND researchers collaborated with Zearn, the product's developer, to design
  this evaluation. Then RAND conducted the study independently, randomly
  assigning 64 schools in an urban Texas district to either supplement classroom
  instruction with Zearn Math in grades 3-5 for two years - or to continue with
  business-as-usual, which included various other supplemental technology
  products. High proportions of economically disadvantaged, Hispanic,
  English-learner, and below-proficient students made up the primary sample of
  10,000+ students. The study preregistered two confirmatory research questions
  about Zearn Math's effects on Texas STAAR math assessment scores, for all
  students and students below proficient at baseline. Those results were
  positive but not statistically significant; equivalent to raising a control
  group student from the median to the 53rd or 54th percentile. Although this
  study did not yield confirmatory evidence that Zearn Math improves student
  learning, consistent positive signals across all estimated confirmatory and
  exploratory effects, including on the MAP adaptive mathematics assessment,
  suggest it holds promise to do so.

    explanation: >-
      The study is randomized at the school level, which satisfies class-level
      randomization.
    quote: >-
      "We randomly selected 64 of those schools to comprise the study sample. We
      used blocked randomization, stratifying by schoolwide percentages of
      students who were economically disadvantaged, English-learners, and
      proficient in mathematics in the 2020-2021 academic year." (p. 14)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We randomly selected 64 of those schools to comprise the study sample.
      We used blocked randomization, stratifying by schoolwide percentages of
      students who were economically disadvantaged, English-learners, and
      proficient in mathematics in the 2020-2021 academic year." (p. 14)

      2) "Within each block, half of the schools were assigned to the treatment
      group and half to the control group, resulting in 32 schools assigned to
      each condition." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomization at the class level or stronger. The
      paper explicitly describes blocked randomization at the school level (64
      schools, 32 per condition). Because school-level randomization is stronger
      than class-level randomization, it satisfies Criterion C by definition
      under the ERCT standard.

      Criterion C is met because randomization occurred at the school level.

      Outcomes were measured using Texas STAAR, a standardized state assessment.
    quote: >-
      "The STAAR assessment, as the state accountability test, is designed to
      measure student proficiency on Texas grade-level mathematics standards
      starting in grade 3." (p. 14)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The STAAR assessment, as the state accountability test, is designed to
      measure student proficiency on Texas grade-level mathematics standards
      starting in grade 3." (p. 14)

      2) "In collaboration with Zearn we chose the STAAR as the outcome for
      confirmatory RQs 1 & 2, because it has high relevance for administrators,
      educators and families, and its focus on grade-level content might be
      well-suited to capturing effects of Zearn Math's grade-level approach to
      supporting all students to succeed at learning grade-level content."
      (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires a standardized exam-based assessment rather than a
      bespoke test created for the study. The paper identifies Texas STAAR as
      the "state accountability test" used for the confirmatory outcomes, which
      is a standardized assessment aligned to Texas grade-level standards.

      Criterion E is met because the primary outcome uses the standardized STAAR
      exam.

    explanation: >-
      The study ran across two school years, exceeding the minimum one-term
      requirement.
    quote: >-
      "Sixty-four schools within one urban school district in Texas participated
      in this study over the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years." (p. 14)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Sixty-four schools within one urban school district in Texas
      participated in this study over the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years."
      (p. 14)

      2) "Treatment group schools gained access to Zearn Math, received training
      for building leaders, instructional leaders, and teachers, and were asked
      to integrate Zearn Math into their instructional practice for the two-year
      study period." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcomes to be measured at least one full academic
      term after the intervention begins. The paper states the study spanned two
      school years (2022-2023 and 2023-2024) and describes a two-year study
      period. Two academic years necessarily exceed one term.

      Criterion T is met because the tracking period spans two school years.

  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control condition is clearly described and supported by detailed
      baseline and implementation documentation.
    quote: >-
      "Control group schools were asked not to use Zearn Math and to continue
      with business as usual for the two years." (p. 14)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Control group schools were asked not to use Zearn Math and to continue
      with business as usual for the two years." (p. 14)

      2) "Table 1: Descriptive statistics and group balance for primary sample"
      (p. 43)

      3) "The most common products selected by control group teachers changed
      from Imagine Math, Kahoot, and Go Math! in year 1 to ST Math, i-Ready, and
      IXL in year 2." (p. 32)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires a well-documented control group, including what the
      control group received and evidence that the groups are comparable at
      baseline. The paper explicitly defines the control condition as
      "business as usual" and states that control schools were asked not to use
      Zearn. It also provides a baseline balance table (Table 1) with sample
      sizes and demographic and baseline achievement characteristics. Finally,
      the paper documents what supplemental products control teachers used, by
      listing common products across years.

      Criterion D is met because the control condition, baseline composition,
      and typical control-group resources are documented.

      Random assignment was implemented at the school level (64 schools).
    quote: >-
      "Within each block, half of the schools were assigned to the treatment
      group and half to the control group, resulting in 32 schools assigned to

      2) "Within each block, half of the schools were assigned to the treatment
      group and half to the control group, resulting in 32 schools assigned to
      each condition." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level randomization. The paper describes
      blocked randomization of schools, with 64 schools selected and allocated
      to treatment and control conditions (32 per condition). This directly
      satisfies the school-level RCT requirement.

      Criterion S is met because the unit of randomization is the school.

    explanation: >-
      RAND conducted the evaluation independently of Zearn, supported by IES
      funding.
    quote: >-
      "The RAND team then received a grant from the Institute of Education
      Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, to conduct the study independently
      of Zearn." (p. 2)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "RAND researchers collaborated with Zearn, the product's developer, to
      design a randomized experiment to evaluate Zearn Math's effects over two
      years on student mathematics achievement in grades 3 to 5." (p. 2)

      2) "The RAND team then received a grant from the Institute of Education
      Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, to conduct the study independently
      of Zearn." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the study be conducted independently from the
      intervention's developer to reduce bias. The paper acknowledges
      collaboration with Zearn on design, then explicitly states that RAND
      received an IES grant "to conduct the study independently of Zearn." This
      is strong, direct evidence of independent conduct as defined by the ERCT
      standard.

      Criterion I is met because the paper explicitly states independent conduct
      by RAND.

      Outcomes were tracked over two full academic years (2022-2023 and
      2023-2024).
    quote: >-
      "Sixty-four schools within one urban school district in Texas participated

      2) "Treatment group schools gained access to Zearn Math, received training
      for building leaders, instructional leaders, and teachers, and were asked
      to integrate Zearn Math into their instructional practice for the two-year
      study period." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcomes to be measured at least one academic year
      after the intervention begins. The paper states the study covered two
      school years and explicitly frames the implementation as a two-year study
      period. This exceeds the one-year minimum.

      Criterion Y is met because the study spans two academic years.

  b:

    explanation: >-
      Although Zearn provided additional implementation supports, teachers
      reported similar total math instructional time across groups and the
      supports appear integral to the tested intervention package.
    quote: >-
      "In both years, teachers in both groups reported spending similar amounts
      of time on math instruction, including time spent on math-related
      supplemental technology products outside of the regular math period."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Treatment group schools gained access to Zearn Math, received training
      for building leaders, instructional leaders, and teachers, and were asked
      to integrate Zearn Math into their instructional practice for the two-year
      study period." (p. 14)

      2) "Zearn provided implementation support to the treatment group schools
      throughout the study period." (p. 9)

      3) "Zearn also provided implementation coaching to each treatment group
      school, which typically comprised bi-weekly calls between a Zearn coach
      and the school's implementation point-of-contact to review school usage
      data, highlight areas of success, and discuss any challenges hindering
      usage." (p. 9)

      4) "During the spring of each study year, Zearn facilitated challenges to
      motivate on-or-above-grade-level lesson completion. These challenges
      offered prizes to students, classrooms, and schools based on lesson
      completion." (p. 9)

      5) "In both years, teachers in both groups reported spending similar
      amounts of time on math instruction, including time spent on math-related
      supplemental technology products outside of the regular math period."
      (p. 31)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B asks whether time and resources are balanced between treatment
      and control unless additional resources are explicitly part of what is
      being tested. Here, the treatment condition includes access to Zearn plus
      explicit implementation supports (training, coaching, and incentive
      challenges with prizes). These are additional resources relative to the
      control condition.

      However, the paper frames these supports as part of the delivered
      intervention package (implementation support and coaching are described
      as what Zearn "provided" to treatment schools). In addition, the study
      reports that teachers in both groups spent similar total time on math
      instruction, including time on supplemental technology, which reduces the
      risk that the estimated effects are simply driven by more total math time
      in treatment.

      Under the ERCT decision rule, this is best categorized as "resources are
      integral to the design" and not merely optional add-ons. The study is
      therefore estimating the effect of adopting Zearn Math as implemented,
      including its implementation supports, relative to business as usual.

      Criterion B is met because total instructional time is reported as similar
      across groups and the added supports appear integral to the tested
      intervention package.

      An independent, peer-reviewed randomized study by a different author
      compared Zearn Math to another program, serving as an external replication
      effort on the intervention.
    quote: >-
      "To ensure that students benefit from high-quality learning experiences,
      the current conceptual replication of Wang and Woodworth, a randomized

      education math instruction, DreamBox Learning and Zearn Math."
      (Foster, Abstract)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication published in a peer-
      reviewed journal by a different research team. Foster (Journal of
      Research on Educational Effectiveness, volume 17) is authored by Matthew
      E. Foster (not the RAND author team) and describes a randomized trial
      involving Zearn Math in a different setting and sample. While it is not a
      replication of this Texas district study design, it is an independent
      randomized evaluation involving the same intervention (Zearn Math), which
      constitutes relevant reproduction evidence for the intervention.

      Criterion R is met because an independent peer-reviewed randomized study
      evaluated Zearn Math in another context.

      2) "RQ4. (Exploratory) What are the effects of Zearn Math on mathematics
      achievement growth, as measured by the MAP adaptive assessment, overall
      and for the above-listed subgroups?" (p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based outcomes across all main
      subjects to detect spillovers (for example, gains in math at the expense
      of reading). The research questions and outcomes in this paper are
      exclusively mathematics-focused (STAAR math and MAP math). There is no
      evidence of standardized outcomes reported for reading, language arts,
      science, or social studies.

      Criterion A is not met because only mathematics outcomes are assessed.

  g:

    explanation: >-
      The study reports outcomes through the end of the second study year and
      does not track students to graduation.
    quote: >-
      "Yitsd represents student's Texas STAAR score measured at the end of study

      2) "Yitsd represents student's Texas STAAR score measured at the end of
      study year 2 of student i, with teacher t, in school s, in random
      assignment block d." (p. 20)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation, and it also
      depends on Criterion Y (which is met here). The paper describes a two-year
      study window and defines the primary outcome as measured at the end of
      study year 2. It does not describe follow-up beyond year 2, nor does it
      report graduation outcomes for the cohort.

      A web search for follow-up publications by the same author team that track
      this cohort to a graduation endpoint did not identify any such papers.

      Criterion G is not met because tracking ends at the end of study year 2
      with no graduation follow-up reported.

      The paper states a REES registry ID, but the public registry entry date

      2) "To make REES even more secure, you will need to sign in using your
      ICPSR Researcher Passport." (REES website)

      3) "The sample was determined by enrollment on the date of the state's
      official enrollment snapshot at the beginning of study year 1 (October 28,
      2022)." (p. 15)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the study protocol be preregistered before the
      study begins, and that this timing be verifiable. The paper asserts that
      confirmatory questions and the analysis plan were preregistered at REES
      (Registry ID: 17280.1v1). However, to validate Criterion P as specified,
      we must verify the registry entry date precedes the start of the study.

      The REES site indicates that viewing registry records may require signing
      in, and the specific public registry record for 17280.1v1 with a visible
      registration date could not be located and verified as publicly
      accessible. Without a verifiable preregistration date that is prior to
      the study start (with the sample defined at the beginning of study year 1
      on October 28, 2022), the criterion cannot be confirmed under the ERCT
      rules.

      Criterion P is not met because the preregistration timing could not be
      independently verified to precede study start.
