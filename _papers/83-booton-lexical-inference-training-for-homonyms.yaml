abstract: >-
  Background: Many words have multiple meanings, which present challenges to
  learning, yet research has yet to identify effective interventions for
  homonyms. Lexical inference may be a promising strategy. Aim: To evaluate a
  brief, novel lexical inference intervention for homonyms. Samples: Children
  aged 7–8 years (Study 1: N = 180, Study 2: N = 76). Study 2 included children
  with English as an Additional Language (EAL, n = 37). Methods: In two
  randomized controlled trials, participants were assigned to either inference
  training or control (Study 1: spatial training; Study 2: implicit exposure
  through reading). Their receptive knowledge of taught and untaught homonyms
  was measured before and after the intervention, and in Study 2, metacognitive
  and inference skills too. Results: Those in the inference interventions showed
  greater gains in receptive knowledge than control groups. In Study 2, children
  also showed improvement in the inference test with homonyms, and while
  children with EAL had a specific challenge with receptive knowledge of
  homonyms compared to their EL1 peers, the intervention was equally effective
  for both groups. Receptive knowledge and inference with homonyms predicted
  unique variance in reading comprehension. The intervention showed limited
  transfer to untaught words, although patterns of errors provided some
  indication of improved understanding. Conclusions: A brief inference training
  is effective for gaining knowledge of homonyms, with limited transfer to
  untaught words, and the intervention is equally effective for children with
  EAL and EL1.

  c:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization was at the individual child level (not class- or
      school-level), and the paper does not frame the intervention as a
      tutoring-style exception.
    quote: >-
      "Participants were randomly assigned by the primary investigator to one of
      two types of training: inference training (n=60) or spatial (control)
      training (n=120)." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Participants were randomly assigned by the primary investigator to one
      of two types of training: inference training (n=60) or spatial (control)
      training (n=120)." (p. 4)

      2) "Participants with EAL (n=37) or EL1 (n=39) were assigned by stratified
      randomization into one of two interventions: inference (n=40) or reading
      (n=36)." (p. 9)

      3) "...an equal number within each of these groups were assigned to
      conditions via the random number generator formula in Excel by the
      researchers delivering the interventions." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomization at the class level (or stronger, such
      as school-level) to reduce contamination, unless the study is explicitly a
      personal-tutoring style intervention where student-level randomization is
      acceptable.

      In Study 1, the paper explicitly states that "Participants were randomly
      assigned" to conditions, indicating individual-level randomization rather
      than randomizing intact classes or schools. In Study 2, the paper again
      reports individual-level assignment via stratified randomization, with
      assignment implemented by the researchers delivering the interventions.

      Although the intervention is delivered by an experimenter (small groups,
      and in Study 2 sometimes individually), the paper does not describe the
      intervention as a tutoring program where student-level randomization is an
      intended and justified design exception. Therefore, the ERCT class-level
      randomization requirement is not satisfied.

      Criterion C is not met because the unit of randomization is the child, not
      the class or school, and no tutoring-style exception is clearly stated.

    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The main pre/post outcomes are researcher-created homonym measures rather
      than standardized exam-based assessments.
    quote: >-
      "The Homonyms: receptive test was created to assess children's
      recognition of the meanings of the selected homonyms..." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The Homonyms: receptive test was created to assess children's
      recognition of the meanings of the selected homonyms based on a previous
      assessment (Booton, Hodgkiss et al., 2022)." (p. 5)

      2) "Children's ability to infer the intended meaning (primary or
      secondary) of homonyms in context was assessed as a further aspect of word
      knowledge which could be affected by the intervention." (p. 11)

      3) "To examine how homonym knowledge relates to reading comprehension, the
      York Assessment of Reading for Comprehension (YARC; Snowling et al., 2009)
      passage reading subtest form A was used." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires that the study's outcome evaluation relies on
      standardized, widely recognized exam-based assessments (rather than
      bespoke, researcher-created instruments aligned to the intervention).

      The paper states that the "Homonyms: receptive test was created," which
      indicates a custom measure. The intervention effects throughout the paper
      are evaluated primarily using these homonym-focused receptive and
      inference measures.

      While a standardized reading comprehension instrument (YARC) is included,
      it is used to examine relationships with reading comprehension rather than
      serving as the primary standardized exam outcome for the RCT treatment
      effect.

      Criterion E is not met because the main pre/post outcomes are measured
      using researcher-created homonym assessments rather than standardized
      exams.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Post-testing occurred about one week after a short (~2-week) intervention,
      far shorter than one academic term from intervention start.
    quote: >-
      "Interventions were then conducted in groups of four; each group then
      completed four 30-min intervention sessions across a two-week period...
      Then, one week later, children completed a posttest battery including the
      same tests." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Interventions were then conducted in groups of four; each group then
      completed four 30-min intervention sessions across a two-week period."
      (p. 7)

      2) "Then, one week later, children completed a posttest battery including
      the same tests." (p. 7)

      3) "Three sessions of 15–25min were completed over approximately 2weeks."
      (p. 13)

      4) "Then, one week later, children completed the post-test measures in a
      fixed order in one session." (p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcomes to be measured at least one full academic
      term (typically ~3–4 months) after the intervention begins.

      Study 1 reports intervention delivery "across a two-week period" with
      post-testing "one week later." Study 2 similarly reports intervention
      sessions "over approximately 2weeks" with post-testing "one week later."

      These timelines are measured in weeks from intervention start to outcome
      measurement and therefore do not reach the minimum duration of one
      academic term required by Criterion T.

      Criterion T is not met because outcome measurement occurs within weeks,
      not at least a term after intervention start.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The paper clearly describes what the control groups received and reports
      baseline comparability checks between conditions.
    quote: >-
      "Two spatial training conditions served as a control: Children completed
      four training sessions of spatial visualization training with or without
      physical manipulatives." (p. 6)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Two spatial training conditions served as a control: Children
      completed four training sessions of spatial visualization training with or
      without physical manipulatives." (p. 6)

      2) "There was no explicit vocabulary teaching." (p. 6)

      3) "There was no difference in age (t (177)=1.69, p=.092), mother's
      education (t (177)=1.34, p=.182), gender (χ2 (178)=0.003, p=.959) or
      bilingual status (χ2 (145)=0.02, p=.897) between the two conditions."
      (p. 8)

      4) "The reading intervention was designed as an active control group with
      implicit instruction..." (p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires a well-documented control group, including a clear
      description of what the control group did/received and sufficient
      information to judge comparability.

      In Study 1, the control condition is explicitly described as spatial
      visualization training (with/without manipulatives) and the authors state
      that there was "no explicit vocabulary teaching." The paper also reports
      baseline demographic comparability checks between conditions.

      In Study 2, the control is explicitly described as an "active control
      group with implicit instruction" (reading-based exposure and activities).

      Criterion D is met because the control conditions are described in
      sufficient operational detail and baseline comparability is documented.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Participants were drawn from multiple schools, but randomization was not
      conducted at the school level.
    quote: >-
      "Participants were randomly assigned by the primary investigator to one of
      two types of training..." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Participants were Year 3 children (aged 7 to 8 years) from six
      medium-to-large English state primary schools..." (p. 4)

      2) "Participants were randomly assigned by the primary investigator to one
      of two types of training: inference training (n=60) or spatial (control)
      training (n=120)." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the school level (i.e., schools are
      assigned to intervention/control), which strengthens real-world relevance
      and reduces school-level confounding.

      The paper reports sampling across multiple schools, but it describes
      random assignment of "Participants" to conditions, rather than
      randomization of schools to conditions.

      Criterion S is not met because the unit of randomization is not the
      school.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention delivery and assignment were carried out by the research
      team, and no independent evaluation team is documented.
    quote: >-
      "...assigned to conditions via the random number generator formula in
      Excel by the researchers delivering the interventions." (p. 9)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Participants were randomly assigned by the primary investigator to one
      of two types of training..." (p. 4)

      2) "Data collection was completed in a quiet area of children's schools by
      trained psychology research assistants." (p. 6)

      3) "...assigned to conditions via the random number generator formula in
      Excel by the researchers delivering the interventions." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires clear documentation that the trial was conducted
      independently of the intervention designers/providers (e.g., external
      evaluators running implementation and/or analysis).

      The paper indicates researcher-led assignment (by the primary
      investigator; and, in Study 2, via Excel randomization by "the researchers
      delivering the interventions"). Data collection is described as performed
      by trained research assistants and by researchers, but the paper does not
      document that these individuals are independent of the intervention design
      team.

      Without an explicit statement of independent conduct (e.g., a third-party
      evaluation team with separation from intervention development), the ERCT
      independence requirement is not met.

      Criterion I is not met because independent conduct is not clearly
      documented and key trial functions were performed by the research team.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention and follow-up span only weeks, far below 75% of an
      academic year, and Criterion Y is not met when Criterion T is not met.
    quote: >-
      "Three sessions of 15–25min were completed over approximately 2weeks."
      (p. 13)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Interventions were then conducted in groups of four; each group then
      completed four 30-min intervention sessions across a two-week period."
      (p. 7)

      2) "Then, one week later, children completed a posttest battery including
      the same tests." (p. 7)

      3) "Three sessions of 15–25min were completed over approximately 2weeks."
      (p. 13)

      4) "Then, one week later, children completed the post-test measures in a
      fixed order in one session." (p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least 75% of an academic year
      after the intervention begins.

      Both studies report very short intervention periods (about two weeks) and
      outcome measurement one week later. This is far shorter than an academic
      year.

      Additionally, under the ERCT dependency rule provided, if Criterion T is
      not met then Criterion Y is not met; here T is not met.

      Criterion Y is not met because outcomes are measured within weeks rather
      than most of an academic year.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Study 2 likely provides more experimenter time per child in the inference
      condition (individual) than in the control (pairs), and this resource
      imbalance is not framed as the treatment variable.
    quote: >-
      "During the intervention, children worked individually (inference
      condition) or in pairs (reading condition) with the experimenter." (p. 13)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "There were 4 sessions of 30min." (p. 6)

      2) "Two spatial training conditions served as a control: Children
      completed four training sessions of spatial visualization training..."
      (p. 6)

      3) "They completed interactive activities and received feedback during
      training, as in the intervention condition..." (p. 6)

      4) "The reading intervention was designed as an active control group with
      implicit instruction..." (p. 13)

      5) "During the intervention, children worked individually (inference
      condition) or in pairs (reading condition) with the experimenter." (p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B compares the nature, quantity, and quality of resources (time,
      adult attention, materials) provided to intervention and control
      conditions, unless extra resources are explicitly the treatment variable.

      In Study 1, the intervention and control are both active programs with
      comparable structure: both involve four sessions, and the control is
      described as involving interactive activities and feedback "as in the
      intervention condition." This suggests reasonable balance in Study 1.

      In Study 2, however, the delivery format differs in a way that changes
      adult attention per child: inference is delivered individually whereas the
      reading control is delivered in pairs. This likely implies materially more
      experimenter time/attention per child in the inference condition.

      The paper frames Study 2 as comparing inference training to implicit
      exposure through reading, not as a test of increased adult attention as
      the treatment variable. The control is not described as matching this
      per-child adult support.

      Criterion B is not met because Study 2 plausibly introduces a non-trivial
      resource imbalance (adult attention per child) not clearly framed as the
      intended treatment variable.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication by a different author team was found or
      documented; the paper reports two trials conducted by the same research
      team.
    quote: >-
      "The efficacy of a novel inference intervention for teaching homonyms was
      demonstrated across two pre-post randomized controlled trials..." (p. 18)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Methods: In two randomized controlled trials, participants were
      assigned to either inference training or control (Study 1: spatial
      training; Study 2: implicit exposure through reading)." (p. 1)

      2) "The efficacy of a novel inference intervention for teaching homonyms
      was demonstrated across two pre-post randomized controlled trials, when
      compared to a spatial training (Study 1) and implicit exposure to the same
      words through shared reading (Study 2)." (p. 18)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires independent reproduction of the study/intervention by
      a different research team (ideally in a different context) in a
      peer-reviewed publication.

      This article reports two RCTs (Study 1 and Study 2), but both are within
      the same paper and appear to be conducted by the same author team. The
      paper does not provide evidence that an independent, external research
      team replicated the "Word Detectives" inference intervention.

      An internet search (using the paper title, author names, intervention
      name, and DOI) did not identify a peer-reviewed independent replication by
      another author team as of the ERCT check date.

      Criterion R is not met because no independent external replication of this
      study/intervention was found.
  a:

    explanation: >-
      Standardized exams across all core subjects are not used, and per the ERCT
      dependency rule, Criterion A is not met because Criterion E is not met.
    quote: >-
      "To examine how homonym knowledge relates to reading comprehension, the
      York Assessment of Reading for Comprehension (YARC; Snowling et al., 2009)

      York Assessment of Reading for Comprehension (YARC; Snowling et al., 2009)
      passage reading subtest form A was used." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all main
      subjects. The ERCT rules provided also state that if Criterion E is not
      met, then Criterion A is not met.

      Here, the primary intervention outcomes are based on researcher-created
      homonym measures (so E is not met). Additionally, even the standardized
      assessment noted (YARC) addresses reading comprehension rather than "all
      main subjects" via standardized exams.

      Criterion A is not met because standardized exam-based assessment across
      all main subjects is not present, and E is not met.

      The study does not track participants to graduation, and under ERCT rules
      Criterion G is not met because Criterion Y is not met.

      2) "Then, one week later, children completed the post-test measures in a
      fixed order in one session." (p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation from the
      relevant educational stage.

      This paper reports only short-term post-testing (one week after the end of
      short interventions), and it does not describe any longer-term follow-up,
      end-of-year tracking, or tracking to graduation.

      Per the ERCT dependency rule provided, if Criterion Y (Year Duration) is
      not met then Criterion G is not met; here Y is not met.

      Internet searching for follow-up publications by the same authors that
      tracked this cohort to graduation did not identify any such graduation
      tracking study as of the ERCT check date.

      Criterion G is not met because the paper has no graduation tracking and Y
      is not met.
  p:

    explanation: >-
      Although Study 2 is stated to be pre-registered on OSF, the registration
      record/date could not be verified and the paper does not provide dates to
      confirm pre-registration occurred before data collection.
    quote: >-
      "This study's method and analyses were pre-registered on the Open Science
      Framework..." (p. 9)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study's method and analyses were pre-registered on the Open
      Science Framework (https://osf.io/qdnjh/?view_only=622934f24b0f45349326f483cbe584cf)
      and any exploratory deviations from this are noted." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the full study protocol be pre-registered before
      the study begins, with verifiable registration timing (registration date
      earlier than data collection start).

      The paper explicitly states that Study 2 was "pre-registered" on OSF and
      provides a view-only OSF link, which is strong evidence of intent to
      preregister.

      However, the paper does not provide (in the article text) a registration
      date nor explicit calendar dates for data collection start. During this
      ERCT check, attempts to verify the OSF record and its timestamp via public
      sources were not successful (the view-only OSF link did not provide
      accessible registration metadata in the available browsing environment).
      Therefore, the timing requirement cannot be confirmed.

      Criterion P is not met because the pre-registration timing (date before
      data collection) could not be verified from accessible records and is not
      documented with dates in the paper text.

## Change Summary (vs. provided YAML)

- Filled in missing metadata:
  - Set `paper_link` to the DOI landing page.
  - Set `pdf_link` to a direct open PDF (Oxford ORA “version of record”).
  - Set `date_erct_check` to **2026-02-21**.
- Updated `publication_date` to **2026-01-05** (publisher/ORA date).
- Checked and corrected multiple quotes to match the PDF verbatim (notably
  spacing such as `n=60` vs `n = 60`, and exact phrasing).
- Rewrote all `analysis` fields to follow the required structure:
  “Relevant Quotes” → “Detailed Analysis” → one-sentence verdict.
- Re-checked Criterion B using the updated ERCT Criterion B definition and kept
  it **not met**, focusing on the adult-attention imbalance in Study 2
  (individual vs pairs) without an explicit “resources are the treatment”
  framing.
- Re-checked Criteria G, R, and P with internet searching:
  - **G**: no graduation-tracking follow-up located; also blocked by Y not met.
  - **R**: no independent replication located.
  - **P**: OSF preregistration is stated, but the timestamp could not be
    verified and the paper lacks dates to confirm preregistration preceded data
    collection.
- Confirmed `erct_level` remains **0** because Level 1 criteria (C, E, T, D) are
  not all met (only D is met).
