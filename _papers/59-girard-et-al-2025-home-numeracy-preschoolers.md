abstract: >-
  The home numeracy environment is suggested to influence children's numerical
  development, but causal evidence for this assertion remains limited.
  Addressing this gap, we randomly assigned 117 predominantly White 4- to
  5-year-olds (M = 4.68 years, SD = 0.2, 47% girls) attending preschool in in
  Flanders (Belgium) to either an experimental (numeracy) or an active control
  (language) condition. The 6-week intervention (pretest-March 2023;
  posttest-May 2023) consisted of an ecologically valid implementation, with
  parents integrating flexible activities into their routines. Pre- and
  post-intervention assessments measured children’s numerical skills. Medium
  effects were observed on transcoding and ordering skills, providing causal
  evidence for the impact of the home numeracy environment on children’s
  numeracy. This study highlights the potential of ecologically valid
  interventions to support early numeracy in daily life.

  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Randomization was within classes, but the intervention is parent-child
      one-to-one home teaching, which fits the ERCT tutoring/personal teaching
      exception for Criterion C.
    quote: >-
      "Within a class (and a school), children were randomly assigned to either
      the experimental (Numeracy, n = 59) or the control condition (Language,
      n = 58) (Figure 1)." (p. 13)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Within a class (and a school), children were randomly assigned to
      either the experimental (Numeracy, n = 59) or the control condition
      (Language, n = 58) (Figure 1)." (p. 13)

      2) "The 6-week intervention (pretest-March 2023; posttest-May 2023)
      consisted of an ecologically valid implementation, with parents
      integrating flexible activities into their routines." (p. 2)

      3) "Eighth, the classroom-level randomization in our study was
      implemented to control for potential confounding effects related to
      preschool experiences." (p. 40)

      4) "However, this approach could have introduced the possibility that
      parents from different groups (experimental vs. control) within the same
      classroom shared some of the activities and it was not possible to
      actively monitor or prevent such sharing." (p. 40)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The unit of randomization is within class, which would normally fail the
      ERCT Class-level RCT requirement due to potential contamination between
      conditions. However, the intervention is implemented at home by parents
      with their own child, and the ERCT standard explicitly allows a
      student-level RCT when the intervention is personal teaching/tutoring.
      The paper’s description makes clear this is a parent-child home activity
      intervention, and not a teacher-delivered classroom intervention. The
      authors also acknowledge the main contamination risk that could exist
      here (parents sharing activities across conditions within a classroom),
      but that risk does not negate the personal-teaching nature of the
      intervention.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is met because this is a one-to-one
      parent-child home teaching intervention, which fits the ERCT exception.

      Primary outcomes are measured with researcher-developed numeracy tasks,
      not with widely recognized standardized exams.
    quote: >-
      "Children’s numerical skills were measured with five tasks previously
      developed by our research team and validated in studies with children of
      the same age range (Bakker et al., 2023; Rathé et al., 2022; Turan & De
      Smedt, 2023; Vandecruys et al., 2024)." (p. 17)

      Smedt, 2023; Vandecruys et al., 2024)." (p. 17)

      2) "Mathematical language. Children’s mathematical language was assessed
      using the Preschool Assessment of the Language of Mathematics (PALM)
      from Purpura and Logan (2015) adapted by Turan and De Smedt (2023)."
      (p. 18)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion E requires standardized, widely recognized exam-based
      assessments for the main educational outcomes. The paper explicitly says
      its main numeracy outcomes are measured with tasks "previously developed
      by our research team", which are research instruments rather than
      standardized exams. The PALM measure is an assessment instrument, but it
      is presented as a task used in research (and adapted for this context),
      not as a system-wide standardized exam that would satisfy ERCT’s intent.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because outcomes are assessed with
      researcher-developed tasks rather than standardized exams.

    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured about 6 weeks after intervention start, which is
      shorter than a full academic term (about 3-4 months).
    quote: >-
      "The 6-week intervention (pretest-March 2023; posttest-May 2023)

      consisted of an ecologically valid implementation, with parents
      integrating flexible activities into their routines." (p. 2)

      2) "We measured children’s once before and once after the 6-week
      intervention (in March 2023 and in May 2023, respectively) with the same
      set of tests." (p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion T requires outcome measurement at least one full academic
      term after the intervention begins. The paper explicitly describes a
      6-week intervention and states pretest in March 2023 with posttest in May
      2023, which is substantially shorter than a typical term-length follow-up
      window.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is not met because the measurement interval is
      only about 6 weeks, not a full academic term.

      The control condition is described in detail and baseline characteristics
      are reported with descriptive tables.
    quote: >-
      "In the control condition, participants received equivalent materials -
      such as a verbal memory game, a visual memory game (pictures, letters,
      rhymes), a bingo game, and a storybook - without numerical content."

      (p. 16)

      2) "Descriptive statistics for children’s and parents’ characteristics at
      pretest are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively." (p. 23)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion D requires a well-documented control group, including what
      the control group received and baseline comparability information. The
      paper provides a concrete description of the active control materials and
      explicitly reports descriptive baseline characteristics for children and
      parents at pretest in Tables 1 and 2, supporting interpretability of
      comparisons.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the control condition and
      baseline characteristics are documented in sufficient detail.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization occurred within classes rather than assigning whole schools
      to intervention vs control.
    quote: >-
      "Within a class (and a school), children were randomly assigned to either
      the experimental (Numeracy, n = 59) or the control condition (Language,
      n = 58) (Figure 1)." (p. 13)

      either the experimental (Numeracy, n = 59) or the control condition
      (Language, n = 58) (Figure 1)." (p. 13)

      2) "The children came from 26 different schools (including 42 different
      classrooms) in the Flemish part of Belgium." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion S requires school-level randomization (schools assigned to
      conditions). The paper states that randomization was within class (and
      within school), which indicates student-level assignment rather than
      school-level assignment, even though many schools participated.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met because the unit of randomization
      is not the school.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper does not report that an independent third-party evaluation team
      conducted the study; implementation and evaluation appear to be run by
      the research team.
    quote: >-
      "Children were assessed at their school, individually in a quiet room by
      an experimenter blind to the condition." (p. 13)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Children were assessed at their school, individually in a quiet room
      by an experimenter blind to the condition." (p. 13)

      2) "In the experimental condition, participants were provided with a set
      of materials adapted from previous intervention studies, designed to
      elicit interactions about numeracy." (p. 15)

      3) "Following our pre-registered analysis plan (https://osf.io/k5ea9),
      we first assessed the quality of our randomization by testing whether
      the conditions did not differ at pretest." (p. 21)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion I requires the study to be conducted independently from
      the intervention designers to reduce bias. The paper describes the
      intervention materials and the evaluation procedures using first-person
      "we" statements and indicates the intervention materials were selected
      and adapted as part of the study design. While the assessor was blind to
      condition, the paper does not state that an external agency or
      independent evaluation team conducted implementation, data collection,
      or analysis.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because independence from the
      intervention design team is not demonstrated.

    explanation: >-
      The intervention and outcome measurement span only about 6 weeks, not a
      full academic year.
    quote: >-
      "We measured children’s once before and once after the 6-week
      intervention (in March 2023 and in May 2023, respectively) with the same
      set of tests." (p. 13)

      set of tests." (p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion Y requires outcomes to be measured at least one full
      academic year after the intervention begins (even if the intervention
      itself is shorter). The paper clearly reports only a 6-week window
      between pretest and posttest.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because the study does not track
      outcomes for a full academic year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study uses a matched active control with equivalent materials,
      engagement, and support, isolating numeracy content as the main
      difference.
    quote: >-
      "The primary and only difference between the two conditions was the
      inclusion of numerical content in the experimental condition and its
      absence in the control condition." (p. 16)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In the control condition, participants received equivalent materials
      - such as a verbal memory game, a visual memory game (pictures, letters,
      rhymes), a bingo game, and a storybook - without numerical content."
      (p. 16)

      2) "Three activities per week were suggested in the booklet for both
      conditions, but families were free to decide which activities to play,
      how often, and how challenging to make them, thereby preserving
      ecological validity." (p. 16)

      3) "Weekly videos (three per condition) were sent via email or text
      message, providing additional guidance and motivation." (p. 16)

      4) "The primary and only difference between the two conditions was the
      inclusion of numerical content in the experimental condition and its
      absence in the control condition." (p. 16)

      5) "This letter emphasized that participation entailed exploring a set
      of materials with their child over a six-week period, with activities
      designed to take no more than 10 minutes per day." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion B requires that time and resources are balanced between
      intervention and control unless extra resources are explicitly the
      treatment variable. Here, the paper describes an active control condition
      that receives equivalent materials, a comparable suggested activity
      schedule, and equivalent ongoing support (weekly videos and surveys).
      The authors explicitly state that the "primary and only difference" is
      numeracy content, implying that time, contact, and materials are matched.
      The described per-day activity time is part of participation for both
      conditions, and no unbalanced additional tutoring time, budget, or
      staffing is described for only one arm.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is met because resources and engagement are
      explicitly matched across conditions, with numeracy content as the only
      stated difference.

      No independent replication by a different research team is identified,
      and the paper frames the work as novel.
    quote: >-
      "To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate
      positive effects of an HNE intervention on preschoolers’ numeracy skills

      playful activities with minimal supervision." (p. 34)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion R requires independent replication by other authors in a
      peer-reviewed publication. The paper itself characterizes the study as
      the first of its kind, and an external literature search performed for
      this ERCT check did not identify an independent replication of this
      specific intervention as of the ERCT check date.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because no independent replication
      study is found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Criterion E is not met and the study does not measure standardized
      outcomes across all core subjects.
    quote: >-
      "Children’s numerical skills were measured with five tasks previously
      developed by our research team and validated in studies with children of
      the same age range (Bakker et al., 2023; Rathé et al., 2022; Turan & De
      Smedt, 2023; Vandecruys et al., 2024)." (p. 17)

      Smedt, 2023; Vandecruys et al., 2024)." (p. 17)

      2) "As a control measure, we included the Matrix Reasoning subtest of the
      Dutch Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition
      (Wechsler, 2011)." (p. 19)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all
      main subjects, and ERCT explicitly states that if Criterion E is not met
      then Criterion A is not met. In addition, the outcomes reported here are
      numeracy tasks (plus a non-verbal reasoning control), not a full set of
      core-subject standardized exams.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because Criterion E is not met and
      there is no all-subject standardized assessment.

      Year-long tracking is not present and the paper reports no delayed

    quote: >-

      result, we cannot determine whether the observed intervention effects

      consisted of an ecologically valid implementation, with parents
      integrating flexible activities into their routines." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation, and the
      ERCT rules specify that if Criterion Y (year duration) is not met, then
      Criterion G is not met. This study reports only a short pretest-posttest
      window and explicitly states it did not include even a delayed posttest.
      A targeted external search for later follow-up papers by these authors
      reporting longer-term tracking for this cohort did not identify any such
      graduation-tracking publication as of the ERCT check date.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because the study lacks year-long
      follow-up (and explicitly lacks delayed posttesting), so graduation
      tracking is absent.

      The paper states an OSF pre-registration link, but the ERCT check could
      not verify a time-stamped registration date before data collection.

      2) "The study was conducted between February and May 2023." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion P requires a time-stamped pre-registration that can be
      verified to have occurred before data collection began. The paper
      provides an OSF link and describes the study timing (February to May
      2023). However, during this ERCT check, the OSF page contents needed to
      confirm the registration timestamp (date registered) could not be
      retrieved from the registry/database, so the check cannot verify that the
      OSF record is a time-stamped preregistration created before data
      collection.

      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met because the preregistration timing
      cannot be independently verified from the registry record.
