  Background: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into
  nursing education presents a novel approach to enhancing critical
  thinking skills. This study evaluated the effectiveness of
  LLM-assisted Problem-Based Learning (PBL) compared to traditional PBL
  in improving critical thinking skills among nursing students. Methods:
  Participants were randomly assigned to either a traditional PBL group
  (50 nursing students) or an LLM-integrated PBL group (50 nursing
  students). The California Critical thinking Skills test was used to
  assess critical thinking skills. Results: The LLM-integrated PBL group
  showed a more pronounced increase (0.60 points) in critical thinking
  skills compared to the PBL group (0.50 points, p<.01). A notable
  difference was observed in inductive reasoning skills between the PBL
  group and the LLM-integrated PBL group (p<.01). Conclusion: This
  study provides empirical evidence supporting the use of LLM-assisted
  PBL as an effective educational strategy in nursing education.

# Criteria substructure
criteria:
  c:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study randomized individual students within a single
      institution rather than randomizing at the class level.
    quote: >
      "Students were randomly assigned to either the PBL group or the
      LLM-integrated PBL group using a computer-generated randomization
      sequence..." (p. 217)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The sample consisted of first-year nursing students from a
      nursing college affiliated to Guizhou University... 50 nursing
      students in the PBL group and 50 in the LLM-integrated PBL group."
      (p. 217)

      2) "Students were randomly assigned to either the PBL group or the
      LLM-integrated PBL group using a computer-generated randomization
      sequence to ensure an unbiased distribution of participants."
      (p. 217)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires randomization at the class level or
      school level to prevent contamination and simulate real-world
      implementation, unless the intervention is specifically designed
      as 1-on-1 tutoring. This study involves Problem-Based Learning
      (PBL), which is a group-based activity ("engaging in real-world,
      open-ended problems in groups"). However, the randomization was
      performed at the individual student level, assigning 100 students
      into two groups. This poses a risk of contamination if students
      interact outside the specific intervention hours within the same
      college. Since it is not a class-level randomization, this
      criterion is not met.

      Therefore, criterion C is not met.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The study utilized the California Critical Thinking Skills Test
      (CCTST), a widely recognized standardized assessment.
    quote: >
      "The California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST), developed by
      Facione, was used to assess various dimensions of critical
      thinking among nursing students." (p. 217)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST), developed
      by Facione, was used to assess various dimensions of critical
      thinking among nursing students." (p. 217)

      2) "The CCTST has demonstrated moderate reliability... and
      evidence of construct validity through experimental studies...
      supporting its use as an assessment tool for critical thinking
      skills." (p. 217)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires the use of standardized exam-based
      assessments that are widely recognized, rather than custom-made
      tests designed solely for the study. The authors explicitly
      utilized the CCTST, citing its development by Facione and
      providing reliability and validity metrics. This is a standard,
      commercially available instrument for assessing the primary
      outcome (critical thinking).

      Therefore, criterion E is met.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The intervention lasted only 8 weeks, which is shorter than the
      required full academic term (typically 3-4 months).
    quote: >
      "It is also important to consider the relatively short duration of
      the educational intervention (an 8-week course with a total of 16
      hours)..." (p. 219)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "It is also important to consider the relatively short duration
      of the educational intervention (an 8-week course with a total of
      16 hours)..." (p. 219)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires that outcomes be measured at least one
      full academic term (approximately 3-4 months) after the
      intervention begins to ensure effects are not merely transitory.
      The authors explicitly state in the limitations section that the
      intervention was an "8-week course." This duration is
      significantly shorter than a standard academic semester or term.

      Therefore, criterion T is not met.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The study documents the control group's size, demographics, and
      baseline performance scores in detail.
    quote: >
      "The demographic comparison revealed no significant differences in
      age... with an average age of 18.04 years for the PBL group..."
      (p. 217)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Participants were randomly assigned to either a traditional
      PBL group (50 nursing students) or an LLM-integrated PBL group (50
      nursing students)." (p. 216)

      2) "The demographic comparison revealed no significant differences
      in age... with an average age of 18.04 years for the PBL group (SD
      0.76)... The majority of participants were female (93%), with 47
      (94%) female participants in PBL..." (p. 217)

      3) "Table. Critical Thinking Skills and Subscales... PBL (n=50)
      Pretest Mean Score (SD)..." (p. 218)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires detailed documentation of the control group
      including demographics, baseline performance, and treatment
      received. The text provides specific sample sizes (N=50), age
      statistics, and gender distribution for the control (PBL) group.
      Additionally, the Table on page 218 provides the pretest mean
      scores for the PBL group across all subscales. The control
      condition (traditional PBL without LLM) is also clearly defined.

      Therefore, criterion D is met.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study was conducted within a single nursing college with
      randomization at the student level, not the school level.
    quote: >
      "The sample consisted of first-year nursing students from a
      nursing college affiliated to Guizhou University..." (p. 217)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The sample consisted of first-year nursing students from a
      nursing college affiliated to Guizhou University in Guiyang,
      China." (p. 217)

      2) "Students were randomly assigned... using a computer-generated
      randomization sequence..." (p. 217)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization to occur among schools (units
      implementing the intervention) to test real-world relevance and
      avoid school-wide confounding factors. This study was conducted at
      a single site ("a nursing college") and randomized individual
      students within that single site. No school-level assignment
      occurred.

      Therefore, criterion S is not met.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study was conducted by the authors themselves; only the
      randomization process was handled by an independent researcher.
    quote: >
      "This randomization process was conducted by an independent
      researcher who was not involved in the teaching or assessment of
      the students." (p. 217)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Author Affiliations: Guiyang Vocational and Technical College...
      Guizhou University... Department of Plastic Surgery, Guizhou
      Provincial People's Hospital..." (p. 216)

      2) "This randomization process was conducted by an independent
      researcher who was not involved in the teaching or assessment of
      the students." (p. 217)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires the study (data collection and analysis) to
      be conducted independently from the intervention designers to
      remove bias. While the authors state that an "independent
      researcher" handled the *randomization*, there is no statement
      that the teaching, data collection, or analysis were conducted by
      an external third party. The authors appear to be the primary
      researchers and educators involved.

      Therefore, criterion I is not met.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study duration was 8 weeks, which does not meet the
      requirement of one full academic year.
    quote: >
      "...an 8-week course with a total of 16 hours..." (p. 219)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "It is also important to consider the relatively short duration
      of the educational intervention (an 8-week course with a total of
      16 hours)..." (p. 219)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcomes to be measured at least one full
      academic year (~9-10 months) after the intervention begins. Since
      Criterion T (Term Duration) was not met, Criterion Y cannot be
      met. The study explicitly identifies the duration as an "8-week
      course," which is significantly shorter than an academic year.

      Therefore, criterion Y is not met.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The study tests the integration of LLMs as the variable; both
      groups received equal course time (16 hours), satisfying the
      balance requirement.
    quote: >
      "...an 8-week course with a total of 16 hours..." (p. 219)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Participants were randomly assigned to either a traditional
      PBL group... or an LLM-integrated PBL group." (p. 216)

      2) "It is also important to consider the relatively short duration
      of the educational intervention (an 8-week course with a total of
      16 hours)..." (p. 219)

      3) "This study evaluated the effectiveness of LLM-assisted
      Problem-Based Learning (PBL) compared to traditional PBL..."
      (p. 216)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires that control groups utilize balanced
      time and resources unless the extra resource is the specific
      variable being tested. In this study, the "extra resource" is
      access to and integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This is
      explicitly the treatment variable defined in the study intent.
      Regarding time resources, both groups participated in the same
      "8-week course with a total of 16 hours." Therefore, the
      time-on-task was balanced, and the resource difference (LLM
      access) is the integral component being tested.

      Therefore, criterion B is met.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      No independent replication of this specific study was found in
      peer-reviewed journals.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first
      randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of
      LLM-integrated PBL in enhancing nursing students' critical
      thinking skills..." (p. 218)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper claims to be the first RCT of its kind. A search of
      recent literature reveals no subsequent independent replications
      of this specific protocol by different research teams in different
      contexts published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.

      Therefore, criterion R is not met.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study measured only critical thinking skills and the specific
      course test score, not all main subjects taught in the school.
    quote: >
      "We also analyzed the students' test scores at the end of the
      course... there was no statistically significant difference in
      grades..." (p. 218)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST)... was
      used to assess various dimensions of critical thinking..."
      (p. 217)

      2) "We also analyzed the students' test scores at the end of the
      course... there was no statistically significant difference in
      grades..." (p. 218)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires assessing effects across all core subjects
      taught in the school/program to detect potential negative
      spillovers (e.g., did focusing on LLM-PBL reduce performance in
      anatomy or pharmacology?). This study measured critical thinking
      and the specific course grade but did not assess standardized
      outcomes across the broader nursing curriculum.

      Therefore, criterion A is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Outcomes were measured immediately after the course ended, with no
      tracking until graduation.
    quote: >
      "After the entire course was completed, all students filled out
      questionnaires on critical thinking skills." (p. 217)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "After the entire course was completed, all students filled out
      questionnaires on critical thinking skills." (p. 217)

      2) "The results indicated a significant improvement...
      postintervention (Table)." (p. 217)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires tracking participants until graduation to
      assess long-term impacts. This study measured outcomes immediately
      upon completion of the 8-week course. A search for follow-up
      publications by the same authors yielded no results tracking this
      specific cohort to graduation.

      Therefore, criterion G is not met.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The paper mentions following CONSORT but does not provide a
      registration number or evidence of pre-registered protocol.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study report followed the Consolidated Standards of
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT) criteria..." (p. 217)

      2) "Before the data collection, the protocol underwent a thorough
      review, and we got ethical approval..." (p. 217)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The standard requires the full study protocol to be pre-registered
      (e.g., on a public registry like ClinicalTrials.gov) before data
      collection begins. While the authors mention ethical approval and
      following CONSORT guidelines, they do not cite a specific
      pre-registration ID number, nor does a search of public registries
      reveal a pre-registered protocol corresponding to this specific
      study prior to the stated data collection period.

      Therefore, criterion P is not met.
