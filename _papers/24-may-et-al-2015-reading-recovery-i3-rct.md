  Reading Recovery (RR) is a short-term, one-to-one intervention
  designed to help the lowest achieving readers in first grade. This
  article presents first-year results from the multisite randomized
  controlled trial (RCT) and implementation study under the $55 million
  Investing in Innovation (i3) Scale-Up Project. For the 2011-2012
  school year, the estimated standardized effect of RR on students'
  Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) Total Reading Scores was .69
  standard deviations relative to the population of struggling readers
  eligible for RR under the i3 scale-up and .47 standard deviations
  relative to the nationwide population of all first graders.
  School-level implementation of RR was, in most respects, faithful to
  the RR Standards and Guidelines, and the intensive training provided
  to new RR teachers was viewed as critical to successful
  implementation.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "At each participating school, a subsample of eight
      low-performing students eligible for Reading Recovery was
      identified... students were matched into pairs according to
      pretest scores and ELL status. One student in each pair was
      randomly assigned to the treatment group... and the other
      student in the pair was assigned to the control group."
      (p. 554)

      2) "Prior to the start of the 2011-2012 school year, 209
      schools participating in the i3 scale-up ... were randomly
      selected for inclusion in a randomized controlled trial."
      (p. 554)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard for criterion C requires that the intervention
      be tested at the classroom level to prevent cross-group
      contamination, implying randomization of entire classes. Quote 1
      indicates that within each school, individual students were
      randomized into treatment and control groups after being matched
      into pairs. This is student-level randomization, not class-level.
      Quote 2 shows that schools were randomly selected to participate
      in the RCT, but the randomization of students within those
      schools (as per Quote 1) determines the intervention assignment,
      not the school selection. Although Reading Recovery is a
      one-to-one intervention, the standard specifies class-level
      testing without explicit exceptions for such interventions
      unless school-level randomization (criterion S) is met, which it
      is not (see criterion S analysis). Thus, the randomization does
      not align with the class-level requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is not met because the randomization
      was at the student level within schools, not at the class level.

      1) "Upon the conclusion of the intervention for each treatment
      group student, both students in that matched pair were assessed
      at approximately the same time using the reading section of the
      Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS)." (p. 555)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires the use of standardized exams that are
      widely recognized, not custom tests. The paper specifies that the
      Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS), specifically its reading
      section, was used to assess outcomes. The ITBS is a
      well-established, nationally recognized standardized test used
      across the US for assessing student achievement, fulfilling the
      criterion’s requirement for an objective and comparable measure.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is met because the study used the
      ITBS, a widely recognized standardized exam, for assessment.

      provide daily instruction to students during 30-minute,
      one-to-one teaching sessions." (p. 549)

      2) "Teachers were instructed to administer the ITBS test to any
      treatment group student who exited Reading Recovery as soon as
      possible after his or her exit." (p. 555)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires the intervention to last at least one
      full academic term (approximately 3-4 months). Quote 1 describes
      Reading Recovery as a "short-term" intervention involving daily
      30-minute sessions, typically lasting 12-20 weeks as noted in the
      paper (e.g., "52.4% of students in Reading Recovery successfully
      discontinued before the 20th week," p. 555). This duration (3-5
      months) aligns with a semester or term. Quote 2 indicates outcomes
      were assessed post-intervention, consistent with a term-length
      study. Although exact start and end dates are not specified, the
      standard duration of Reading Recovery meets the term requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is met because the intervention
      lasted 12-20 weeks, approximately one academic term.

      2) "The control group received classroom instruction, plus the
      option for a non-RR intervention, if available." (p. 554)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires detailed documentation of the control
      group's characteristics, size, and conditions. Quote 1 refers to
      Table 1, which provides baseline demographics (gender, ELL status,
      race) and prior reading performance (text reading level) for both
      treatment and control groups, showing no significant differences
      (e.g., "p = .96" for gender). Quote 2 describes the control
      group's condition as standard classroom instruction with an
      optional non-RR intervention, indicating no special treatment
      beyond normal schooling. The final sample size (n = 433 per
      group) is also documented (p. 559). This level of detail satisfies
      the criterion.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the control group is
      well-documented with demographics and baseline data.

      participating in the i3 scale-up were randomly selected for
      inclusion in a randomized controlled trial." (p. 554)

      2) "Within the 158 schools that participated in the RCT, a total
      of 1,253 students were randomly assigned to treatment (N = 628)
      and control (N = 625) conditions." (p. 559)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires randomization at the school level,
      meaning entire schools are assigned to treatment or control.
      Quote 1 indicates 209 schools were randomly selected for the RCT
      from 627 participating schools, but Quote 2 clarifies that within
      these 158 participating schools, students were individually
      randomized. This means the intervention assignment was not at the
      school level but at the student level within schools, as each
      school had both treatment and control students. The standard
      requires the entire school to be the unit of randomization, which
      this study does not meet.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met because randomization was
      at the student level within schools, not at the school level.

      Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS)." (p. 555)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires measurement of all main subjects
      taught in school using standardized exams. Quote 1 shows the
      study assessed only reading via the ITBS reading section, with no
      mention of other subjects like math or science. For first
      graders, core subjects typically include reading, math, and
      sometimes science or social studies. The focus solely on reading,
      despite using a standardized exam (meeting criterion E), does not
      satisfy the all-subjects requirement. No exception for
      specialized interventions applies here, as reading is a core
      subject.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because only reading was
      assessed, not all main subjects.

      teaching sessions." (p. 549)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires the intervention to last at least one
      full academic year (9-10 months). Quote 1 describes Reading
      Recovery as "short-term," typically 12-20 weeks (noted in "52.4%
      discontinued before the 20th week," p. 555), which is about 3-5
      months. This is less than a full year, though it meets criterion T
      (term duration). The study’s focus on "Year One" refers to the
      evaluation period, not the intervention duration per student,
      which remains 12-20 weeks.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because the intervention
      duration is less than one full academic year.

      1) "The control group received classroom instruction, plus the
      option for a non-RR intervention, if available." (p. 554)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires the control group to receive equal time
      and resources as the treatment group unless the extra resources
      are the treatment variable. Quote 1 shows the control group
      received standard classroom instruction with an optional non-RR
      intervention, while the treatment group received additional
      30-minute daily RR sessions (p. 549). The paper does not specify
      that control students received equivalent instructional time or
      resources, nor does it state that extra time was the treatment
      variable. This imbalance suggests the treatment effect may
      include the additional time, not just the intervention’s content.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is not met because the control group
      did not receive equivalent resources or time.
    quote: >
      "The control group received 'classroom instruction, plus the
      option for a non-RR intervention, if available.'"

      approximately the same time using the reading section of the Iowa
      Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS)." (p. 555)

      2) "Results suggest that the long-term impact of Reading Recovery
      on students' reading/ELA test scores in 3rd and 4th grades is
      statistically significant and substantially negative; students who
      participated in Reading Recovery in first grade had 3rd and 4th
      grade state test scores ... 0.19 to 0.43 standard deviations ...
      below the state test scores of similar students who did not
      participate." (May et al., 2023)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires tracking students until graduation to
      assess long-term impacts. Quote 1 indicates assessment occurred
      immediately after the intervention (12-20 weeks), with no mention
      of follow-up until first-grade graduation or beyond. The study
      focuses on "Year One" results, ending midyear (p. 561), far short
      of tracking to graduation. A later follow-up study by the same
      team tracked students through third and fourth grades, finding no
      sustained gains (May et al., 2023). Even that extended tracking
      did not follow students to any form of graduation.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because there was no
      tracking until graduation.

      Recovery on qualifications at age 16 is marked in this study and
      suggests a sustained intervention effect.'" (Hurry et al., 2021)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires independent replication by a different
      research team. The paper, published in 2015, does not reference
      any replication of its specific RCT design or findings by others.
      As a first-year report, it is unlikely to have been replicated
      yet, and no external studies are cited as replications. Since
      then, an independent UK study found positive long-term effects of
      Reading Recovery (Hurry et al., 2021). However, that study was a
      longitudinal follow-up, not a replication of the RCT by a
      different team, and no new randomized trial by others exists.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because there is no
      evidence of independent replication.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires the study to be conducted by
      third-party evaluators, not the intervention designers. Quote 1
      states it is an "external evaluation," conducted by researchers
      from the University of Delaware and University of Pennsylvania,
      not directly affiliated with Reading Recovery’s developers (e.g.,
      Marie Clay or the Reading Recovery Council). The paper’s context
      as an i3 grant evaluation suggests independence from the program’s
      design team, meeting the criterion.

      (No quotes mentioning pre-registration)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires pre-registration of the study protocol
      before data collection. The paper, conducted in 2011-2012 and
      published in 2015, does not mention pre-registration or a registry
      platform. Pre-registration was less common then, and no evidence
      suggests it occurred prior to the intervention start. Additionally,
      no record of a pre-registration for this trial was found in any
      trial registry (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov or AEA RCT registry).

      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met because there is no
