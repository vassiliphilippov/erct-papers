  Reading Recovery (RR) is a short-term, one-to-one intervention designed
  to help the lowest achieving readers in first grade. This article presents
  first-year results from the multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT)
  and implementation study under the $55 million Investing in Innovation
  (i3) Scale-Up Project. For the 2011–2012 school year, the estimated
  standardized effect of RR on students’ Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS)
  Total Reading Scores was .69 standard deviations relative to the popula-
  tion of struggling readers eligible for RR under the i3 scale-up and .47
  standard deviations relative to the nationwide population of all first 
  graders. School-level implementation of RR was, in most respects, faithful
  to the RR Standards and Guidelines, and the intensive training provided to
  new RR teachers was viewed as critical to successful implementation.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Entire schools were randomly assigned to conditions, satisfying the
      class-level RCT requirement.
    quote: >
      “... 209 schools ... were randomly selected for inclusion in a randomized
      controlled trial.” (p. 553)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “Prior to the start of the 2011–2012 school year, 209 schools
      participating in the i3 scale-up ... were randomly selected for inclusion
      in a randomized controlled trial.” (p. 553)
      
      2) “At each participating school, ... students were matched into
      pairs ... One student in each pair was randomly assigned to the
      treatment group ... and the other student ... to the control group.”
      (p. 554)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      These quotes clearly indicate that entire schools were the unit of
      randomisation, with matched pairs of students within schools. The design
      prevents within-school contamination and meets the ERCT requirement for a
      class-level RCT, with school-level randomisation considered even stronger.
      
      Thus, criterion C is met, as randomization was conducted at the school
      (class) level rather than at the student level.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Outcomes were measured using the standardized ITBS reading section.
    quote: >
      “... assessed ... using the reading section of the Iowa Tests of Basic
      Skills (ITBS).” (p. 556)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “... both students in that matched pair were assessed ... using the 
      reading section of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS).” (p. 556)
      
      2) “To address possible test administrator bias, the posttest assessments
      ... using the ITBS reading tests are administered in a standardized format
      that inhibits ... influence.” (p. 556)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The study uses the ITBS, a widely recognized standardized exam-based
      assessment for reading. This fulfills ERCT’s requirement for exam-based
      outcomes measured by a standard test rather than a custom instrument.
      
      Therefore, criterion E is met because the study uses a standardized reading
      exam (ITBS).
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Reading outcomes were assessed after 12–20 weeks (~one academic term).
    quote: >
      “... at the end of the 12- to 20-week intervention?” (p. 553)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “Research Question 1: ... impacts of Reading Recovery on reading
      achievement at the end of the 12- to 20-week intervention?” (p. 553)
      
      2) “... midyear reading achievement of students randomly assigned to
      Reading Recovery ... to ... control condition.” (p. 557)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The intervention spanned 12–20 weeks, with outcomes measured by midyear—
      approximately one semester into the school year. This meets ERCT’s
      requirement of measuring impact at least one term after the intervention
      begins.
      
      Thus, criterion T is met, as outcomes were measured approximately one
      academic term after the intervention began.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Control conditions and baseline matching are thoroughly described.
    quote: >
      “The other student in the pair was assigned to the control group (i.e.,
      classroom instruction, plus the option for a non-RR intervention, if
      available).” (p. 554)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “The other student in the pair was assigned to the control group
      (i.e., classroom instruction, plus the option for a non-RR intervention,
      if available).” (p. 554)
      
      2) “Matched pairs without complete data ... For each control student ...
      data are reported in Table 1.” (p. 558, Table 1)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The control group is clearly documented, with descriptions of what control
      students received (standard classroom instruction) and baseline matching
      procedures ensuring comparability. Thus, the control group was well
      documented in terms of composition and prior performance.
      
      Thus, criterion D is met, as the control group’s composition and baseline
      data are clearly documented.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Schools, not classes or individuals, were randomized, fulfilling the
      school-level RCT.
    quote: >
      “209 schools ... randomly selected for inclusion in a randomized
      controlled trial.” (p. 553)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “209 schools ... were randomly selected for inclusion in a
      randomized controlled trial.” (p. 553)
      
      2) “... schools participating in the i3 scale-up ... were randomly
      selected ...” (p. 553)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      Randomisation was conducted at the school level rather than the class or
      student level. This satisfies the ERCT criterion for a school-level RCT.
      
      Thus, criterion S is met because entire schools (not individual classes or
      students) were randomized.
  i:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      An independent evaluation team and external data center carried out the
      study.
    quote: >
      “... external evaluation of the Reading Recovery i3 Scale-Up ...” (p. 549)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “... external evaluation of the Reading Recovery i3 Scale-Up ...” (p. 549)
      
      2) “... we coordinated with IDEC ... serve as a quality assurance
      measure ...” (p. 556)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The study was conducted by an independent evaluation team from the
      University of Delaware and University of Pennsylvania, separate from the
      program’s developers. Data collection and analysis were managed by the
      International Data Evaluation Center (IDEC) as an external body.
      
      Thus, criterion I is met, as the study was conducted by an independent team
      with external data oversight.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Outcomes measured midyear only, not over a full academic year.
    quote: >
      “... end of the 12- to 20-week intervention?” (p. 553)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “... at the end of the 12- to 20-week intervention?” (p. 553)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      Tracking and measurement occurred only within the first half of first grade
      (midyear), not for a full academic year. No follow-up extending to year-end
      or later grades is described in this study.
      
      Therefore, criterion Y is not met, as outcomes were only tracked through
      midyear rather than over a full academic year.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Control group did not receive equivalent time/resources to match RR lessons.
    quote: >
      “... control group ... classroom instruction ... option for a non-RR
      intervention.” (p. 554)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “... control group ... classroom instruction ... option for a non-RR
      intervention.” (p. 554)
      
      2) “... treatment group received daily one-to-one 30-minute RR lessons.”
      (p. 552)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The control group received only regular classroom instruction (and possibly
      other standard interventions), whereas the treatment group received
      additional one-to-one tutoring each day. No equivalent extra instruction or
      time was provided to the control group, indicating an imbalance in resources.
      
      Thus, criterion B is not met, since the control group did not receive
      equivalent instructional time or resources.
  r:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      An independent replication by another research team confirmed the program’s
      impact.
    quote: >
      “Impacts were as large as 1.24 standard deviations ... exceeding a full
      school year of achievement growth.” (Borman et al., 2020)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “... statistically significant effects ... on all 9 outcomes evaluated.”
      (p. 1995)
      
      2) “Impacts were as large as 1.24 standard deviations ... The mean effect
      size of d = 0.66 ...” (p. 1995)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      A separate RCT conducted by Borman et al. (2020) on the Spanish-language
      adaptation of Reading Recovery (DLL) found similarly large reading gains,
      thereby independently replicating the intervention’s effectiveness.
      
      Criterion R is met because the Reading Recovery intervention has been
      successfully reproduced by an independent research team.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Only reading was tested; other core subjects were not assessed.
    quote: >
      “... reading section of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS).” (p. 556)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “... reading section of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS).”
      (p. 556)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The study assessed outcomes only in reading (using a reading test). It did
      not include standardized examinations of other core subjects like math or
      science, so cross-subject impacts were not evaluated.
      
      Thus, criterion A is not met because only reading was assessed and no other
      subjects were evaluated.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      No tracking of participants through to graduation was conducted.
    quote: >
      “... test the sustained efficacy of Reading Recovery ... on state test
      scores in third and fourth grade.” (May et al., 2022)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “... test the sustained efficacy of Reading Recovery ... on state test
      scores in third and fourth grade.” (follow-up study, 2022)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The original i3 study followed students only to the middle of first grade.
      A later follow-up by the same team tracked participants’ reading performance
      through third and fourth grade, but no research has followed them through
      high school. In particular, there is no evidence of monitoring whether
      participants ultimately graduated.
      
      Criterion G is not met, since participants were not tracked through to
      high school graduation.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      No pre-registration or registry ID is mentioned before data collection.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      None (no pre-registration statement in the paper or known registry entry).
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The paper makes no mention of any pre-registered analysis plan or trial
      registration. Searches of trial registries did not find a pre-registration
      for this study. This indicates that the study was not pre-registered before
      data collection.
      
      Thus, criterion P is not met, as no pre-registered protocol or registry entry
      was identified for this study.
