  Reading Recovery (RR) is a short-term, one-to-one intervention
  designed
  to help the lowest achieving readers in first grade. This article
  presents
  first-year results from the multisite randomized controlled trial
  (RCT) and implementation study under the $55 million Investing in
  Innovation
  (i3) Scale-Up Project. For the 2011–2012 school year, the estimated
  standardized effect of RR on students’ Iowa Tests of Basic Skills
  (ITBS) Total Reading Scores was .69 standard deviations
  relative to the population of struggling readers eligible for RR
  under the i3 scale-up and .47
  standard deviations relative to the nationwide population of all first graders.
  School-level implementation of RR was, in most respects, faithful
  to the RR Standards and Guidelines,
  and the intensive training provided to new RR teachers
  was viewed as critical to successful implementation.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Prior to the start of the 2011–2012 school year, 209 schools
      participating in the i3 scale-up ... were randomly selected for inclusion
      in a randomized controlled trial.” (p. 553)

      2) “At each participating school, ... students were matched into pairs ...
      One student in each pair was randomly assigned to the treatment group ...
      and the other student ... was assigned to the control group.” (p. 554)

      Detailed Analysis:

      These quotes indicate that classes (and indeed entire schools) were not
      mixed for treatment and control; randomization occurred at the school or
      class level rather than within a single class. This meets the ERCT
      requirement for a class-level RCT, as no two students in the same class
      were split between intervention and control.

      Final decision: Criterion C is met because randomization was conducted at
      the class or higher level (schools in this case), avoiding within-class
      contamination.
    explanation: > 
      Randomization occurred at the school (above-class) level, satisfying the
      class-level RCT requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “... both students in that matched pair were assessed ... using the reading
      section of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS).” (p. 556)

      2) “To address possible test administrator bias, ... the ITBS reading tests
      are administered in a standardized format that inhibits ... influence.” (p. 556)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study uses the ITBS, a widely recognized standardized exam-based
      assessment for reading. This fulfills ERCT’s requirement for exam-based
      outcomes measured by a standard test rather than a custom instrument.

      Final decision: Criterion E is met because outcomes were measured using a
      standardized reading test (ITBS) rather than any custom-designed assessment.
    explanation: > 
      Outcomes were measured using the standardized ITBS reading test.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Research Question 1: ... impacts of Reading Recovery on reading
      achievement at the end of the 12- to 20-week intervention?” (p. 553)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention spanned 12–20 weeks, with outcomes measured at midyear,
      corresponding to approximately one academic term. This meets the ERCT
      requirement of measuring outcomes at least one term after the intervention
      begins.

      Final decision: Criterion T is met because the primary outcome was assessed
      about one term (3–5 months) after the start of the intervention.
    explanation: > 
      Reading outcomes were assessed after 12–20 weeks (roughly one academic term).
    quote: >

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “... the other student in the pair was assigned to the control group
      (i.e., classroom instruction, plus the option for a non-RR intervention,
      if available).” (p. 554)

      2) “No significant differences were found between treatment and control
      groups on gender, ELL status, race, or prior reading performance.” (p. 560)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The control group’s conditions are clearly described: control students
      continued with regular classroom instruction (and could receive another
      non-RR intervention if available). Baseline characteristics of control vs.
      treatment students were reported (Table 1), showing the groups were equivalent
      prior to the intervention. Thus, the control group was well documented.

      Final decision: Criterion D is met because the study provides details on what
      the control group received as well as its baseline characteristics.
    explanation: > 
      Control group conditions and baseline characteristics were thoroughly described.
    quote: > 
      “... control group (i.e., classroom instruction, plus the option for a non-RR
      intervention, if available).” (p. 554)

      controlled trial.” (p. 553)

      2) “One student in each pair was randomly assigned to the treatment group
      ... and the other student ... to the control group.” (p. 554)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Although many schools participated, entire schools were not assigned wholly to
      one condition. Instead, within each selected school, individual students were
      randomized to treatment or control. This means randomization occurred at the
      student (within-school) level, not by assigning whole schools to one group or
      the other. Therefore, the study does not meet the stronger school-level RCT
      criterion, since no school was exclusively a “treatment school” or “control school.”

      Final decision: Criterion S is not met because randomization was not done at
      the whole-school level (each participating school had both treatment and control students).
    explanation: > 
      No entire school was solely a treatment or solely a control site; randomization was within schools.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “... external evaluation of the Reading Recovery i3 Scale-Up ...” (p. 549)

      2) “... we coordinated with IDEC to allow RR teachers to enter pretest ... and
      posttest ... data for students in the RCT each year.” (p. 556)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The project was an external evaluation carried out by researchers (e.g., at the
      University of Delaware and University of Pennsylvania) who were not the
      original developers of Reading Recovery. An independent data center (IDEC) was
      used to manage data collection and quality assurance, indicating separation
      between the intervention developers and the evaluators.

      Final decision: Criterion I is met because the study was conducted by an
      independent evaluation team, with external oversight of data collection and
      analysis.
    explanation: > 
      An independent evaluation team (with an external data center) conducted the study, separate from the program’s creators.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “... the end of the 12- to 20-week intervention?” (p. 553)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study’s follow-up ended at midyear of first grade (after the 12–20 week
      intervention). There is no indication in the paper that students were tracked
      for a full academic year or beyond. A later follow-up study by the same authors
      measured outcomes only through 3rd and 4th grades, which still did
      not extend to any graduation point.

      Final decision: Criterion Y is not met because outcomes were not tracked for
      a full year after the intervention’s start.
    explanation: > 
      Outcomes were measured only midyear (half-year), with no full-year follow-up.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “... control group ... classroom instruction ... option for a non-RR
      intervention, if available.” (p. 554)

      2) “... provide daily instruction ... during 30-minute, one-to-one teaching
      sessions.” (p. 548)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention group received substantial additional instructional time
      (daily one-on-one 30-minute Reading Recovery lessons), whereas the control
      group only received the standard classroom instruction (with only an optional
      non-RR intervention if available). There was no evidence that the control group
      received any equivalent extra instructional time or resources to match the
      RR lessons. Therefore, the resources and instructional time were unbalanced
      between groups.

      Final decision: Criterion B is not met because the intervention provided extra
      one-on-one teaching time that was not matched for the control group.
    explanation: > 
      The Reading Recovery group got extra daily tutoring that the control group did not receive, resulting in unbalanced time/resources.

      None found in the main paper or in external literature.

      Detailed Analysis:

      We found no mention of any independent replication of this intervention by a
      different research team. No follow-up publications by other authors were
      identified that attempt to replicate the results of this study.

      Final decision: Criterion R is not met due to the lack of any evidence of an
      independent replication study.

      No evidence was found of an independent replication of this Reading Recovery study by another team.

      1) “... reading section of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS).” (p. 556)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study assessed reading outcomes only. It did not report any testing in other
      core subjects such as mathematics or science. This means the evaluation was 
      limited to the subject of the intervention (reading) and did not examine potential 
      effects on other subjects.

      Final decision: Criterion A is not met because outcomes were only measured in
      reading, not across all main subjects.
    explanation: > 
      Only reading was tested; no standard exams in other core subjects were reported.

      Relevant Quotes:

      (No graduation tracking is reported in this study.)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study did not follow students through to any graduation point. Once the
      intervention and immediate testing were completed, tracking ceased. The authors’
      later work followed the same cohort only up to 3rd and 4th grades,
      well before any kind of graduation. There is no evidence of tracking students
      until they finished their schooling.

      Final decision: Criterion G is not met because participants were not tracked
      through to graduation or the end of their schooling.
    explanation: > 
      The study did not track participants through to graduation.

      Relevant Quotes:

      None; no pre-registration or trial registry entry is mentioned.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The article does not reference any pre-registered study protocol. We found no
      indication that the study was registered in any RCT registry (e.g., AEA or
      ClinicalTrials.gov) before data collection. Thus, the study appears not to have
      been pre-registered.

      Final decision: Criterion P is not met because there is no evidence of a
      pre-registered protocol for this trial.
    explanation: > 
      No pre-registration or registry listing was provided for the study.
