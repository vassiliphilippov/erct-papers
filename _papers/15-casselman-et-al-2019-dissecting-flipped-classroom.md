  The use of the flipped classroom approach in higher education STEM
  courses has rapidly increased over the past decade, and it appears
  this type of learning environment will play an important role in
  improving student success and retention in undergraduate chemistry
  “gatekeeper” courses. Many adopters of the flipped classroom
  structure see the greatest benefit originating from the additional
  time this format provides for the implementation of student-centered
  learning activities during the classroom period. However, results
  from recent quasi-experiments suggest that improved course
  performance for students in flipped classroom environments has a
  significant contribution from the online preclass activities. In
  order to compare the impact of the preclass online learning
  environment to the in-class collaborative activities typically done
  in a flipped classroom, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was
  conducted with student volunteers. A two-day organic chemistry
  stereochemistry unit was delivered to students who were randomly
  assigned to “flipped classroom” and “traditional lecture” treatment
  groups. Performance gains were measured after each phase of the
  instructional intervention for both treatment groups, and these gains
  were compared to students from a randomly assigned negative control
  group. A mixed-methods ANOVA indicates that under these experimental
  conditions the online learning component appears to account for most
  of the improvement in posttest scores observed in the flipped
  classroom treatment. These results suggest optimizing the design of
  the asynchronous online learning environment will positively impact
  student performance outcomes. Therefore, this component of the
  flipped classroom deserves more attention from instructional
  designers and classroom practitioners.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The available participants were then randomly assigned to one of the
      three study groups prior to commencing the study (see Table 1)” (p. 3) 

      2) “Students randomly assigned to the negative control group only completed
      the day 0 and day 7 pre- and posttests and did not receive any learning
      interventions.” (p. 3) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Both quotes make clear that individual student volunteers—
      not intact classes or schools—were randomized to conditions.
      The ERCT standard’s Class‑level RCT (C) criterion requires
      randomization at the class or school level to avoid
      contamination across students in the same classroom. No
      exception for one‑on‑one tutoring applies here, as this is a
      group intervention.

      Therefore, criterion C is not met because the study randomized at the student level rather than class level.
    explanation: > 
      Random assignment occurred at the individual student level,
      not by entire class or school.
    quote: >
      “The available participants were then randomly assigned to one
      of the three study groups prior to commencing the study.” (p. 3)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The pre- and posttest assessments are 22‑item free response
      measures that probe student understanding of stereochemical
      properties of organic molecules (see Supporting Information…).”
      (p. 3) 

      2) “Because customized assessments had to be created to test the
      distinct set of learning objectives covered in the treatment group
      interventions, item‑analyses were carried out…” (p. 4) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Both quotes confirm the outcome measures were bespoke,
      researcher‑designed free‑response instruments aligned to the
      intervention’s content, not a recognized standardized exam.
      This fails the ERCT Exam‑based Assessment (E) requirement
      for using standard tests.

      Therefore, criterion E is not met because the study used custom instruments rather than a standardized exam.
    explanation: > 
      The study employed custom 22‑item free‑response tests rather
      than a standardized exam.
    quote: >
      “The pre‑ and posttest assessments are 22‑item free response

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “… two learning intervention sessions during the seven‑day
      study period during the first and second weeks of the term …”
      (Table 1, p. 3) 

      2) “Students randomly assigned to the negative control group only
      completed the day 0 and day 7 pre‑ and posttests…” (p. 3) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The primary outcomes were measured over a one‑week period,
      far shorter than an academic term (~3–4 months). Thus, the
      ERCT Term Duration (T) criterion is not satisfied.

      Therefore, criterion T is not met because outcome measurement occurred within one week, not a full term.
    explanation: > 
      Outcomes were measured over a seven‑day period, not a full term.
    quote: >
      “two learning intervention sessions during the seven‑day study
      period during the first and second weeks of the term” (Table 1)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Students randomly assigned to the negative control group only
      completed the day 0 and day 7 pre‑ and posttests and did not
      receive any learning interventions. These students provided a
      baseline comparison for the performance gains measured in the two
      treatment groups.” (p. 3) 

      2) “Number of participants (n) n = 16” for the negative control in
      Table 2 (p. 5) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The control group’s size, assessment schedule, and baseline
      role are clearly described in the methods and Table 2.
      This fulfills the ERCT Documented Control Group (D)
      requirement.

      Therefore, criterion D is met because the control group is fully documented.
    explanation: > 
      The negative control group’s composition and baseline data are
      clearly documented.
    quote: >

      2) “Students randomly assigned to the negative control group only
      completed the day 0 and day 7 pre‑ and posttests…” (p. 3) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomization occurred at the student level within a single
      university course, not at the school level. Hence, the ERCT
      School‑level RCT (S) criterion is not met.

      Therefore, criterion S is not met because randomization was not conducted at the school level.
    explanation: > 
      Randomization was at the individual student level, not by school.

      key.” (p. 3) 

      2) “The Playposit questions were embedded within the video …
      featuring the same instructor as the traditional lecture treatment.”
      (p. 4) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The same research team designed, delivered, and assessed the
      intervention without third‑party oversight, failing the ERCT
      Independent Conduct (I) requirement.

      Therefore, criterion I is not met because no external evaluator or independent conductor was involved.
    explanation: > 
      The intervention was designed, delivered, and assessed by the same
      team without independent oversight.

      2) “Students randomly assigned to the negative control group only
      completed the day 0 and day 7 pre‑ and posttests…” (p. 3) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Follow‑up lasted only one week, far shorter than a full academic
      year. This fails the ERCT Year Duration (Y) requirement.

      Therefore, criterion Y is not met because the study did not span a full academic year.
    explanation: > 
      The study tracked outcomes over one week, not a full academic year.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The flipped classroom and traditional lecture treatment groups
      attended two learning intervention sessions … held in the evenings
      outside of the time frame in which most classes on campus are
      scheduled.” (p. 3) 

      2) “Students randomly assigned to the negative control group only
      completed the day 0 and day 7 pre‑ and posttests and did not
      receive any learning interventions.” (p. 3) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The additional evening sessions are integral to the intervention
      itself—testing the effect of extra instructional time in a flipped
      format. Under ERCT’s balanced‑resources exception for treatments
      explicitly testing extra resources, the control group’s “business
      as usual” condition is appropriate.

      Therefore, criterion B is met because the extra evening sessions were an intentional part of the flipped intervention.
    explanation: > 
      The extra evening sessions are central to the intervention and thus
      the unmatched control is acceptable.
    quote: >
      “… two learning intervention sessions … held in the evenings outside
      of the time frame in which most classes on campus are scheduled.”

      – No mention of any independent replication study appears.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The original paper and its supporting information do not reference
      any replication by a separate research team in a different context.

      Therefore, criterion R is not met because no independent replication by other researchers is reported.
    explanation: > 
      No independent replication of this RCT is reported.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The pre‑ and posttest assessments are 22‑item free response
      measures that probe student understanding of stereochemical
      properties of organic molecules…” (p. 3) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Only stereochemistry was assessed; no core subjects (e.g.,
      mathematics, reading, science) were measured. Also, E is not met,
      hence A cannot be met under ERCT rules.

      Therefore, criterion A is not met because assessments focused exclusively on stereochemistry rather than all core subjects.
    explanation: > 
      Only stereochemistry outcomes were measured, and E was not met.
    quote: >
      “The pre‑ and posttest assessments are 22‑item free response measures
      that probe student understanding of stereochemical properties of

      receive any learning interventions.” (p. 3) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      No follow‑up or tracking until graduation is reported—only a one‑week
      assessment window—so the ERCT Graduation Tracking (G) criterion
      is not satisfied.

      Therefore, criterion G is not met because tracking ended at posttest 2 with no further follow-up toward graduation.
    explanation: > 
      Tracking ended after one week; no graduation‑level follow‑up.

      – No statement of pre‑registration or registry ID is provided.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper does not mention any pre‑registered protocol or public
      registry prior to data collection, failing the ERCT Pre‑registered
      Protocol (P) criterion.

      Therefore, criterion P is not met because no pre-registration of the study was reported.
    explanation: > 
      No pre‑registration of the study protocol is mentioned.
