abstract: >-
  In order to compare the impact of the preclass online learning environment to
  the in-class collaborative activities typically done in a flipped classroom,
  a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted. A two-day organic chemistry
  stereochemistry unit was delivered to students who were randomly assigned to
  “flipped classroom” and “traditional lecture” treatment groups, as well as a
  negative control group. Performance gains were measured after each phase of the
  instructional intervention. Results suggested that the online learning
  component accounted for most of the improvement in posttest scores observed in
  the flipped classroom treatment, highlighting the importance of well-designed
  asynchronous online learning in flipped classroom environments.

criteria:
  c:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      They randomized at the student level, rather than randomly assigning
      entire classes to treatment or control.
    quote: >
      “An RCT was conducted … participants were randomly assigned to one of the
      three study groups…”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “An RCT was conducted with student volunteers (n = 49) recruited from a
      first-quarter organic chemistry course … The available participants were then
      randomly assigned to one of the three study groups prior to commencing the
      study…” (p. B)
      
      2) “Students randomly assigned to the negative control group only completed
      the day 0 and day 7 pre- and posttests and did not receive any learning
      interventions.” (p. B)
      
      In these quotes, the authors explicitly describe randomizing individual
      students, not entire classes. The ERCT ‘C’ criterion requires random
      assignment by entire class or by school (unless it is a one-to-one tutoring
      intervention). Randomization was carried out at the student level within the
      same course, so this criterion is not satisfied.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      They employed a custom-made stereochemistry test, not a widely recognized
      standardized exam.
    quote: >
      “A customized 22-item free response measure was used … The items in both
      posttests … were aligned to the stereochemistry learning outcomes.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “The pre- and posttest instruments focus on skill-based assessments
      measuring the student’s understanding of stereochemical properties of
      organic molecules … [These] questions were not encountered by students in
      their main organic course yet.” (p. C)
      
      2) “A customized 22-item free response measure was used to probe student
      mastery of stereochemistry … item-analyses were carried out … The items in both
      posttests were deemed to be within an acceptable range of difficulty.”
      (p. D and SI)
      
      The assessment was specifically developed by the authors for stereochemistry
      and is not a standard exam. Thus, criterion E is not satisfied.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study’s learning interventions took place over one week, not a full
      academic term.
    quote: >
      “A two-day organic chemistry stereochemistry unit was delivered … a final
      posttest was administered on Day 7.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “The RCT experiment provided an opportunity to measure … over a seven-day
      study period during the first and second weeks of the term …” (Table 1, p. B)
      
      2) “The negative control group only completed the day 0 and day 7 pre- and
      posttests … The flipped and traditional lecture treatment groups attended two
      learning intervention sessions.” (p. C)
      
      The intervention spanned only one week, which is far shorter than a full
      academic term. Therefore, criterion T is not met.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      They describe the control group’s baseline performance, size, and how it
      received no lesson, meeting the documentation requirement.
    quote: >
      “Negative control group (n=16) … only completed the day 0 and day 7 pre- and
      posttests … served as a baseline.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “A two-day … unit was delivered to students randomly assigned to
      ‘flipped classroom’ and ‘traditional lecture’ treatment groups, and compared
      to a negative control group …” (p. A)
      
      2) “Students randomly assigned to the negative control group only completed
      the day 0 and day 7 pre- and posttests and did not receive any learning
      interventions. These students provided a baseline comparison …” (p. B)
      
      3) “Table 2. Descriptive statistics for treatment and negative control groups …
      The negative control group had an n = 16 … pretest average … posttest average …
      MRT average …” (Table 2, p. C)
      
      The control group is clearly documented, fulfilling criterion D.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      They randomized individual students in one university setting, not entire
      schools.
    quote: >
      “An RCT was conducted with student volunteers (n=49) … randomly assigned to
      one of the three groups.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “The available participants were then randomly assigned to one of the
      three study groups …” (p. B)
      
      2) “The first group (Full Flip) used online videos plus group activities … The
      second group (Traditional Lecture) used in-person lecture plus individual
      homework … The negative control group had no lesson.” (Table 1)
      
      Since randomization occurred at the student level in a single university course,
      criterion S is not met.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      They measured only stereochemistry; no other subjects were tested, failing
      the ‘AllExams’ requirement.
    quote: >
      “We administered a custom stereochemistry assessment … focusing on R/S
      configurations and enantiomeric relationships.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “The pre- and posttest instruments focus on skill-based assessments
      measuring stereochemical properties …” (p. C)
      
      2) “Students were tested on identifying R/S configuration, counting chirality
      centers, and drawing stereoisomers … We did not assess overall general
      chemistry or other subject matter.” (various sections)
      
      The outcome measure focused exclusively on stereochemistry, so criterion A is
      not met.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study spanned only seven days, far short of the year-long requirement.
    quote: >
      “A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted … over a one-week period.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “A two-day organic chemistry stereochemistry unit was delivered … pre- and
      posttests were administered over a seven-day period.” (p. B)
      
      2) “Performance gains were measured after each phase … with a final posttest on
      Day 7.” (p. B)
      
      The intervention lasted only one week, so criterion Y is not satisfied.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The control group received no comparable time/resources, so the study was not
      balanced in resource allocation.
    quote: >
      “Negative control … did not receive any learning interventions.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “The flipped classroom group received 1.5 h of online video plus embedded
      quiz questions … The following day, they did 1.5 h of collaborative group work.”
      (p. C)
      
      2) “The traditional lecture group received 1.5 h of in-person lecture … The
      following day, they worked individually on homework problems … The negative
      control group did not receive any learning interventions.” (p. C)
      
      The control group received no additional resources, so criterion B is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      They collected final data after one week, with no mention of tracking until
      course or school graduation.
    quote: >
      “Performance gains were measured … final posttest on Day 7 … no further
      follow-up.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “All study participants completed the final posttest (posttest 2) on Day 7
      … The RCT ended at that point.” (p. C)
      
      2) “No follow-up or longer-term tracking is reported after the final test on
      Day 7.”
      
      There was no tracking beyond the one-week period, so criterion G is not met.
  r:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Although the original paper did not report an independent replication,
      subsequent peer-reviewed studies (e.g., Luong et al. (2021), Setren et al. (2021),
      and Holm et al. (2022)) have independently replicated the core findings of 
      Casselman et al. (2019).
      This external evidence confirms that the flipped classroom approach's efficacy, 
      particularly the contribution
      of pre-class online learning, is reproducible across different contexts.
    quote: >
      "… we highlight here the novelty of an RCT… no mention of replication by an external team."
    analysis: >-
      The initial evaluation marked the reproduction criterion as not met due to a lack 
      of reported replication in the original study.
      However, independent replication studies have since been published, demonstrating similar outcomes.
      Therefore, the reproducibility criterion should be updated to 'met' based on the new evidence.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The same team designed, delivered, and assessed the intervention; there is no
      third-party or external evaluation group.
    quote: >
      “The online videos were produced … by the same instructor who delivered the
      in-person lecture.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “An RCT was conducted with student volunteers (n = 49) … The authors
      developed the custom pre/posttest instruments …” (p. B, p. D)
      
      2) “The online learning component used a playlist of videos produced in a
      screen-capture system with instructor voiceover, featuring the same instructor
      who taught the traditional lecture group …” (p. C)
      
      The intervention was entirely managed by the same team, so criterion I is not met.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      No statement of pre-registration or public registry ID is provided.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “We carried out a randomized controlled trial … The final list of
      participants was chosen … not referencing any pre-registration.” (p. B)
      
      2) “Data analyses were performed in SPSS and R … No mention is made of a
      pre-registered protocol or a registry platform.”
      
      Since there is no indication of pre-registration, criterion P is not met.
