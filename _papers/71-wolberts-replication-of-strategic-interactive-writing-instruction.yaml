abstract: >-
  This study reports findings from a nationwide replication and the
  second randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Strategic and Interactive
  Writing Instruction (SIWI), a linguistically responsive framework for
  teaching writing to deaf students. A total of 50 teachers and their
  294 students in grades 3–6 were randomly assigned to either SIWI or
  business-as-usual (BAU) instruction. Writing outcomes were assessed
  with trait-based rubrics and the Structured Analysis of Written
  Language (SAWL) in two genres (recount and information report), along
  with the Woodcock–Johnson IV broad written language composite and
  genre-specific motivation surveys administered at the beginning and
  end of the school year. Students receiving SIWI outperformed peers in
  the BAU group on writing traits across both genres, with effect sizes
  ranging from moderately large (d = 0.70) for informational reports to
  very large (d = 1.11) for recounts. On the SAWL, SIWI students
  demonstrated significantly greater gains in grammatical clarity on
  recount writing, as measured by the word efficiency ratio, with a
  moderate effect size (d = 0.64), although this effect was not observed
  for information reports. Students in the treatment group also reported
  significantly higher motivation for both genres. Unlike the prior RCT,
  no statistically significant differences emerged on the broad written
  language measure (d = 0.27). This may reflect spurious findings in the
  previous study or limitations in this study caused by the COVID-19
  pandemic. Nonetheless, the effect size observed suggests some
  practical importance that warrants further investigation. Findings
  provide robust evidence that SIWI positively impacts deaf elementary
  students’ writing development and motivation, particularly for recount
  genres, while underscoring the importance of replication for
  understanding the generalizability of intervention effects.

    explanation: >-
      Randomization occurred at the teacher/classroom level (not within a
      single classroom by student), meeting the class-level RCT
      requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "There were a total of 294 students who were randomly assigned at
      the teacher level to BAU or treatment groups." (p. 8 of 33)

      2) "Teachers and their students were randomly assigned to BAU and
      treatment groups through a computer-generated randomization
      process." (p. 8 of 33)

      3) "Participants were recruited from schools for the deaf, public
      schools, and mainstream programs across the United States and were
      randomly assigned at the class level to either the SIWI intervention
      group (n = 166) or a BAU control group (n = 128)." (p. 12 of 33)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion C requires that randomization be at the class level
      (or stronger) to reduce contamination that can occur when students
      in the same classroom are split across conditions.

      The paper repeatedly describes random assignment at the "teacher
      level" and also states random assignment at the "class level." In
      this context, "teacher level" functions as classroom-level cluster
      randomization.

      The paper does not indicate that students within a single classroom
      were split into SIWI vs BAU at the same time.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion C is met because teachers/classes
      (not individual students within the same classroom) were randomly
      assigned to SIWI vs BAU.

    explanation: >-
      The study used the standardized Woodcock–Johnson IV Tests of
      Achievement (WJ-IV) as an outcome measure.
    quote: >-
      "Students’ writing performance was also assessed using the broad
      written language cluster from the Woodcock–Johnson IV Tests of

    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Writing outcomes were assessed with trait-based rubrics and the
      Structured Analysis of Written Language (SAWL) in two genres
      (recount and information report), along with the Woodcock–Johnson IV
      broad written language composite..." (p. 1 of 33)

      2) "Students’ writing performance was also assessed using the broad
      written language cluster from the Woodcock–Johnson IV Tests of
      Achievement (WJ-IV; Schrank et al., 2014)." (p. 16 of 33)

      3) "The broad written language cluster was administered at the
      beginning and end of the school year by trained data collectors or
      teachers (when necessary due to COVID-19 limiting access),
      following standardized administration protocols." (p. 16 of 33)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion E requires standardized exam-based assessment(s),
      rather than only researcher-created instruments aligned to the
      intervention.

      While several measures in this paper are rubrics or analytic
      frameworks (trait rubrics, SAWL), the study also includes the WJ-IV,
      a widely used standardized assessment with standardized
      administration protocols.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion E is met because the study used a
      standardized achievement assessment (WJ-IV).
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured at the beginning and end of the school year,
      exceeding a one-term minimum.
    quote: >-
      "Writing instruction for both groups was implemented for one
      academic year; measures were collected at the beginning and end of
      the school year." (p. 8 of 33)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Writing instruction for both groups was implemented for one
      academic year; measures were collected at the beginning and end of
      the school year." (p. 8 of 33)

      2) "Data were collected from student participants at the beginning
      and end of the academic year." (p. 14 of 33)

      3) "All assessments at the beginning of the year were collected
      before teachers began writing instruction." (p. 14 of 33)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion T requires that outcomes be measured at least one
      academic term after the intervention begins.

      The paper specifies baseline (beginning-of-year) data collection
      before instruction began, and outcome measurement at the end of the
      school year, which necessarily exceeds one term.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion T is met because outcomes were
      collected at the end of the school year after beginning-of-year
      baseline assessment.

      The BAU control condition and its participants are documented with
      group sizes, demographics, and descriptions of BAU instruction.
    quote: >-
      "A total of 50 teachers and their 294 students in grades 3–6 were

      instruction." (p. 1 of 33)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A total of 50 teachers and their 294 students in grades 3–6 were
      randomly assigned to either SIWI or business-as-usual (BAU)
      instruction." (p. 1 of 33)

      2) "The treatment group included 26 teachers, and the BAU group
      included 24 teachers." (p. 9 of 33)

      3) "Table 1 presents demographic information for teachers in the
      SIWI and BAU treatment conditions." (p. 9 of 33)

      4) "Table 2 presents demographic information for students in the
      SIWI and BAU treatment conditions." (p. 12 of 33)

      5) "Teachers in the BAU group video-recorded a unit of their typical
      writing instruction, which was submitted to the research team."
      (p. 9 of 33)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion D requires that the control group be well-documented,
      including who is in the control group, what they receive, and
      baseline characteristics.

      The paper defines the control condition as BAU writing instruction,
      gives control-group sizes, provides teacher and student demographics
      (Tables 1 and 2), and describes how BAU instruction was documented
      (including a video-recorded BAU unit).

      Final summary sentence: Criterion D is met because the BAU control
      group is clearly described and baseline characteristics are
      documented.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization occurred at the teacher/classroom level rather than
      assigning entire schools to SIWI vs BAU.
    quote: >-
      "There were a total of 294 students who were randomly assigned at
      the teacher level to BAU or treatment groups." (p. 8 of 33)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "There were a total of 294 students who were randomly assigned at
      the teacher level to BAU or treatment groups." (p. 8 of 33)

      2) "There were a total of 50 teachers and 20 different schools,
      providing an average of 5–6 students per teacher and 14–15 students
      per school." (p. 8 of 33)

      3) "At locations where there was more than one participating
      teacher, an equal number of teachers were assigned to BAU and SIWI
      conditions." (p. 8 of 33)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion S requires randomization at the school level (schools
      assigned to intervention vs control).

      The paper states there were 20 schools, but it explicitly describes
      randomization at the teacher level and balancing assignments among
      teachers within the same location, which implies that teachers
      within a school/site could be split across conditions.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion S is not met because schools were
      not randomized to SIWI vs BAU.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention developers/authors appear to have led SIWI delivery
      supports (PD and coaching), so the study was not independently
      conducted, despite limited external oversight.
    quote: >-
      "An external evaluator was hired to confirm the data collection and
      processing procedures and ensure objectivity measures were in
      place." (p. 14 of 33)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "SIWI participants attended a week-long professional development
      program in Tennessee prior to the start of the school year and
      attended online coaching with a SIWI team member eight times during
      the academic year." (p. 9 of 33)

      2) "They videotaped all writing instruction using a tablet provided
      to them, which allowed for automatic upload via the SWIVL platform
      to a secure area that could be accessed by the researchers."
      (p. 9 of 33)

      3) "An external evaluator was hired to confirm the data collection
      and processing procedures and ensure objectivity measures were in
      place." (p. 14 of 33)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion I requires the study to be conducted independently of
      the intervention designers to reduce bias risk.

      The paper describes SIWI implementation supports delivered via a
      "SIWI team member" (coaching) and researcher access to classroom
      implementation videos, which indicates the SIWI team (aligned with
      the intervention and authorship) was heavily involved in execution.

      While an external evaluator provided some oversight, the paper does
      not describe an independent third party leading the overall
      implementation and evaluation.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion I is not met because the SIWI team
      (aligned with the intervention) delivered key supports and the study
      is not described as independently conducted.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were collected at the beginning and end of the academic
      year, which meets the year-duration requirement, even though
      COVID-19 reduced instructional exposure for some participants.
    quote: >-
      "Writing instruction for both groups was implemented for one
      academic year; measures were collected at the beginning and end of
      the school year." (p. 8 of 33)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Writing instruction for both groups was implemented for one
      academic year; measures were collected at the beginning and end of
      the school year." (p. 8 of 33)

      2) "Data were collected from student participants at the beginning
      and end of the academic year." (p. 14 of 33)

      3) "In the second year (when treatment group numbers were highest),
      the study was impacted by school closures in late February and early
      March due to COVID-19." (p. 9 of 33)

      4) "Instruction was shortened by 3–4 months, and post-data
      collection administration was changed (described under data
      collection)." (p. 9 of 33)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion Y requires that outcomes be measured at least 75% of
      an academic year after the intervention begins.

      The paper explicitly states that measures were collected at the
      beginning and end of the school year, implying a full academic-year
      tracking window from pre to post.

      The paper also reports COVID-19 disruptions and reduced instructional
      exposure for some participants. However, Criterion Y is about the
      time interval from intervention start to outcome measurement, and
      the stated beginning-of-year to end-of-year measurement schedule
      meets the duration threshold.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion Y is met because outcomes were
      collected at the beginning and end of the academic year.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      SIWI teachers received substantial additional resources (paid PD,
      ongoing coaching, on-site visits, and provided technology) that were
      not matched for BAU, and these extra inputs were not framed as the
      treatment variable.
    quote: >-
      "SIWI participants attended a week-long professional development
      program in Tennessee prior to the start of the school year and
      attended online coaching with a SIWI team member eight times during
      the academic year." (p. 9 of 33)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Compensation was offered to participants for one year of
      involvement in the amount of $1000 to BAU teachers and $1500 to SIWI
      teachers." (p. 9 of 33)

      2) "Both BAU and SIWI teachers committed to at least 2–2.5 h a week
      in writing instruction during their participation." (p. 9 of 33)

      3) "SIWI participants attended a week-long professional development
      program in Tennessee prior to the start of the school year and
      attended online coaching with a SIWI team member eight times during
      the academic year." (p. 9 of 33)

      4) "In addition, SIWI coaches conducted two on-site visits to each
      classroom, except during spring 2020, when the onset of COVID-19
      disrupted in-person school operations." (p. 10 of 33)

      5) "They videotaped all writing instruction using a tablet provided
      to them, which allowed for automatic upload via the SWIVL platform
      to a secure area that could be accessed by the researchers."
      (p. 9 of 33)

      6) "Teachers in the BAU group video-recorded a unit of their typical
      writing instruction, which was submitted to the research team."
      (p. 9 of 33)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion B requires balanced time/resources between treatment
      and control unless added resources are explicitly the treatment
      variable being tested.

      Student-facing instructional time is described as similar
      (2–2.5 h/week). However, SIWI teachers received substantial
      additional resources that BAU did not: a week-long institute, eight
      coaching sessions, on-site visits, and provided technology for
      recording/uploading instruction, plus higher compensation.

      The paper frames the comparison as SIWI vs BAU, not as an explicit
      test of "extra PD/coaching/resources" as the causal variable. The
      paper also does not describe a matched placebo PD/coaching package
      for BAU.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion B is not met because SIWI included
      major extra resources that were not matched in BAU and were not
      framed as the treatment variable.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent (different-team) replication of this specific RCT was
      found; the paper is itself a replication of earlier SIWI work but
      conducted by the SIWI research team.
    quote: >-

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study reports findings from a nationwide replication and
      the second randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Strategic and
      Interactive Writing Instruction (SIWI)..." (p. 1 of 33)

      2) "Funded by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), this project
      represents the second RCT of SIWI and the first nationwide
      replication conducted in upper elementary grades." (p. 8 of 33)

      3) "A number of studies conducted outside the development team
      demonstrate the global relevance of SIWI as an effective writing
      program for deaf students." (p. 7 of 33)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion R requires independent replication by a different
      research team in a different context, published in a peer-reviewed
      journal.

      This paper describes itself as a replication and the second RCT of
      SIWI, but the authorship and described implementation supports
      (e.g., coaching by a "SIWI team member") indicate it was conducted
      by the SIWI research/development team rather than an independent
      external team.

      Internet search (performed for this ERCT check) did not identify a
      peer-reviewed, different-team replication of this specific 2026 RCT
      (and, given the publication date, such replications may not yet
      exist).

      Final summary sentence: Criterion R is not met because there is no
      evidence of an independent replication by a different research team.

      3) "Students’ writing performance was also assessed using the broad
      written language cluster from the Woodcock–Johnson IV Tests of
      Achievement (WJ-IV; Schrank et al., 2014)." (p. 16 of 33)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across
      all main subjects taught at the relevant educational level (and it
      depends on Criterion E being met).

      Criterion E is met (WJ-IV is standardized). However, the outcomes
      in this study focus on writing traits, written language, writing
      motivation, and a broad written language composite. The paper does
      not report standardized outcomes for other core subjects (e.g.,
      mathematics, science).

      Final summary sentence: Criterion A is not met because outcomes do
      not cover all core school subjects using standardized exams.
  g:

    explanation: >-
      The study reports outcomes only within an academic year and does not
      report tracking students until graduation.

      academic year; measures were collected at the beginning and end of
      the school year." (p. 8 of 33)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation
      from the relevant educational stage.

      This paper describes pre/post data collection within a single
      academic year and provides no description of longer-term follow-up
      through grade completion or graduation.

      Internet search (performed for this ERCT check) did not identify a
      follow-up publication by the same author team reporting graduation
      outcomes for this RCT cohort.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion G is not met because the study
      reports only within-year outcomes and provides no graduation
      tracking evidence.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper provides IRB information and a data availability DOI but
      does not provide a pre-registration registry/ID and pre-data-
      collection registration date.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
      Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
      University of Tennessee (UTK IRB-17-03771-XP, first approved 6 June

      (p. 28 of 33)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Criterion P requires that the study protocol be pre-registered
      before data collection begins, with evidence of the registry and
      timing.

      The paper provides an IRB identifier and a data-sharing DOI, but it
      does not report a pre-registration platform (e.g., OSF Registries,
      AEA RCT Registry), a registration ID, or a registration date.

      Internet search (performed for this ERCT check) did not identify a
      public pre-registration record explicitly linked to this paper that
      can be verified as registered prior to study start.

      Final summary sentence: Criterion P is not met because no protocol
      pre-registration registry/ID and date are provided or verifiable.

   * **R (Reproduced):** kept **not met**; no independent (different-team)
     replication of this specific 2026 RCT was found. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/16/1/86))  
   * **P (Pre-registered):** kept **not met**; no registry/ID/date for
     pre-registration was found in the paper or via web search. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/16/1/86))  

3) **Criterion Y updated**
   * Changed **Y** from **not met** to **met** because the paper explicitly
     states outcomes were measured at the beginning and end of the academic
     year (meeting the duration requirement), while noting COVID reduced
     instructional exposure for some participants. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/16/1/86))  

4) **Quotes and formatting cleanup**
   * Adjusted some criterion quotes to be more directly supportive (e.g.,
     Criterion D now quotes the paper’s overall BAU assignment statement).
   * Rewrapped all long lines in YAML to stay within the requested **80
     characters per line**, and ensured every `analysis` follows the
     required structure (Relevant Quotes → Detailed Analysis → Final
     summary sentence).

5) **ERCT level recomputed**
   * `erct_level` remains **1** because all Level 1 criteria (C, E, T, D)
     are met, but Level 2 is not (S, I, B are not met). ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/16/1/86))
