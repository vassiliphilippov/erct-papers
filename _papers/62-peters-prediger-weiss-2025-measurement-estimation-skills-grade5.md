abstract: >-
  Students' measurement estimation skills require benchmark knowledge (about
  measures of known objects) and estimation strategies (ways to compare with
  benchmarks). While students' estimation skills have been assessed and unpacked
  in several empirical studies (for length and area but less for mass), approaches
  for fostering them have hardly been empirically studied. We present the
  instructional design of a digital teaching-learning environment designed to
  foster fifth graders' estimation skills for mass measures and empirical evidence
  for its efficacy. The teaching-learning environment encompassed two 45-minute
  sessions and drew upon the design principles of cognitive engagement with
  worked examples, enhanced communication, and scaffolding. A class-wise
  randomized controlled trial was conducted in 14 classes (involving n = 310
  students) with three treatment groups, and two intervention groups worked on
  estimation strategies in the teaching-learning environment. Both intervention
  groups significantly outperformed the control group in the post test. The
  intervention group with highly structured scaffolds only tended to explain the
  strategies slightly better than the intervention group with regular scaffolds,
  albeit not significantly. The findings show that estimation skills can be
  effectively fostered, with a modest indication that highly structured scaffolds
  might hold promise for longer interventions to enhance students' discourse
  practices.

  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Classes were randomly assigned to conditions, satisfying a class-level RCT.
    quote: >-
      "The trial used a class-wise randomized assignment of classes to treatment
      conditions, not a student-wise randomized individual assignment." (p. 11)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A class-wise randomized controlled trial was conducted with 14 classes,
      with a total intervention sample of n = 310 students who completed the
      pretest and posttest." (p. 7)

      2) "classes were randomly assigned" (p. 7)

      3) "The trial used a class-wise randomized assignment of classes to treatment
      conditions, not a student-wise randomized individual assignment." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT criterion C requires randomization at the class (or stronger)
      level. The paper states that the trial was a class-wise randomized
      controlled trial and that classes were randomly assigned to treatment
      conditions, explicitly contrasting this with student-wise assignment. This
      confirms intact classes were the unit of randomization.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met because entire classes were
      randomly assigned to conditions.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The outcome measures were study-specific tests rather than standardized
      exams.
    quote: >-
      "A 17-minute test of estimation skills with 28 items was conducted as a
      pretest and posttest..." (p. 9)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A 17-minute test of estimation skills with 28 items was conducted as a
      pretest and posttest..." (p. 9)

      2) "we developed a rating system for mathematical correctness and the
      discursive elaboration of the argument" (p. 10)

      3) "the test adopted 12 items from other studies on length estimation"
      (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion E requires standardized, widely recognized exam-based
      assessments for the primary outcomes. Here, the primary outcome is
      estimation skills measured via a bespoke pretest-posttest instrument. Even
      though some items were adopted from prior research, the test as a whole is
      not described as a standardized exam, and the authors explicitly developed
      their own rating system for explanations. Therefore, the assessment does
      not meet the ERCT requirement for standardized exams.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is not met because the outcomes
      were measured with study-built instruments rather than standardized exams.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured in a short pre-post design around a 90-minute
      intervention, not one term after the start.
    quote: >-
      "The teaching-learning environment encompassed two 45-minute sessions..."
      (p. 1)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The teaching-learning environment encompassed two 45-minute sessions..."
      (p. 1)

      2) "A class-wise randomized controlled trial was conducted with 14 classes,
      with a total intervention sample of n = 310 students who completed the
      pretest and posttest." (p. 7)

      3) "The short time of the intervention (restricted to 90 min) does not allow
      for capturing long-term learning gains" (p. 21)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion T requires that outcomes are measured at least one full
      academic term after the intervention begins. The intervention is described
      as two 45-minute sessions, and the study design is a pretest-posttest trial.
      The discussion explicitly notes the short 90-minute duration and the lack
      of long-term measurement. There is no indication of term-long follow-up
      from intervention start to the primary outcome measurement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is not met because measurement was
      not conducted one term after intervention start.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control group is described and the paper provides group composition and
      background characteristics.
    quote: >-
      "The control group, CG, also worked in a digital teaching-learning
      environment, but on another aspect of mass units, namely understanding mass
      unit conversions." (p. 8)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The control group, CG, also worked in a digital teaching-learning
      environment, but on another aspect of mass units, namely understanding mass
      unit conversions." (p. 8)

      2) "Three treatment conditions were compared" (p. 8)

      3) "Table 2. Descriptive characteristics of the intervention sample and the
      three treatment groups." (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion D requires a well-documented control group, including what
      the control group did and who was in it. The paper describes the control
      group's activity (a digital environment focused on mass unit conversions)
      and explains the rationale for the active control. It also provides a table
      of descriptive characteristics for the intervention sample and each treatment
      group, supporting comparability checks.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because the control group
      condition and sample characteristics are documented in the paper.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization occurred at the class level, not by random assignment of
      schools.
    quote: >-
      "The trial used a class-wise randomized assignment of classes to treatment
      conditions..." (p. 11)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      (p. 7)

      2) "The trial used a class-wise randomized assignment of classes to treatment
      conditions, not a student-wise randomized individual assignment." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion S requires school-level randomization. The paper repeatedly
      describes the trial as class-wise randomized and specifies that classes
      were the randomized units. No evidence is provided that whole schools were
      randomized to conditions.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is not met because the unit of
      randomization was classes, not schools.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention designers and university-affiliated staff were involved in
      implementation and study conduct.
    quote: >-
      "design of learning environment, N.P. and S.P.; data gathering and data
      curation, N.P." (p. 22)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The classes of the intervention and control groups were taught by
      carefully prepared research-near teachers (from the university group)"
      (p. 9)

      2) "design of learning environment, N.P. and S.P.; data gathering and data
      curation, N.P." (p. 22)

      3) "formal analysis, S.P., N.P. and J.W." (p. 22)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion I requires independent conduct by evaluators separate from
      the intervention designers. The author contribution statement indicates
      that authors who designed the learning environment also participated in
      data gathering and analysis. In addition, teaching was done by research-
      near teachers from the university group. The paper does not present an
      external, independent evaluation team that implemented and evaluated the
      intervention separately from the designers.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is not met because the designers
      were involved in conducting and analyzing the trial.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study did not track outcomes for a full academic year, and criterion T
      is not met.
    quote: >-
      "The short time of the intervention (restricted to 90 min) does not allow
      for capturing long-term learning gains" (p. 21)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The teaching-learning environment encompassed two 45-minute sessions..."
      (p. 1)

      2) "A class-wise randomized controlled trial was conducted with 14 classes,
      with a total intervention sample of n = 310 students who completed the
      pretest and posttest." (p. 7)

      3) "The short time of the intervention (restricted to 90 min) does not allow
      for capturing long-term learning gains" (p. 21)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion Y requires outcome tracking at least one full academic year
      after intervention start. This study is a short pretest-posttest design
      around a 90-minute intervention, with no evidence of year-long follow-up.
      Additionally, per ERCT rule, if criterion T is not met then criterion Y is
      not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is not met because there is no
      year-long follow-up after intervention start.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention did not add extra time or budget relative to control; all
      groups used comparable digital environments.
    quote: >-
      "classes in all three conditions worked in a digital teaching-learning
      environment on mass units" (p. 8)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "classes in all three conditions worked in a digital teaching-learning
      environment on mass units" (p. 8)

      2) "The teaching-learning environment encompassed two 45-minute sessions"
      (p. 1)

      3) "CG control group with intervention on other topic, converting mass units
      (3 sessions of 45 minutes each)" (p. 7, Figure 3)

      4) "IG-HS intervention on estimation skills with highly structured scaffolds
      (2 sessions of 45 minutes each)" (p. 7, Figure 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B asks whether extra time, budget, or resources are provided to
      the intervention condition without a comparable substitute in control,
      unless extra resources are explicitly the treatment variable. Here, all
      groups used a digital teaching-learning environment on mass units, keeping
      the platform context comparable. The intervention itself is short (two
      45-minute sessions), and the control group is described as receiving an
      active digital alternative and even slightly more session time (three
      45-minute sessions). Therefore, there is no unbalanced increase of time or
      resources favoring the intervention.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met because the intervention
      does not provide extra resources relative to control, and the control has a
      comparable digital alternative activity.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication study was identified in the paper or in an
      external literature search.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In this paper, we present a digital teaching-learning environment"
      (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion R requires an independent replication by other authors in a
      different context, published in a peer-reviewed venue. The paper presents
      an original efficacy study and does not cite an independent replication.
      An external search (by DOI, title, and author names) did not identify a
      peer-reviewed independent replication of this specific intervention study
      as of the ERCT check date.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is not met because no independent
      replication was found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were not assessed with standardized exams across all main subjects,
      and criterion E is not met.
    quote: >-
      "classes were randomly assigned, using estimation skills as the dependent
      variable." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "classes were randomly assigned, using estimation skills as the dependent
      variable." (p. 7)

      2) "A 17-minute test of estimation skills with 28 items was conducted as a
      pretest and posttest..." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all main
      subjects. This study measures a single domain outcome (estimation skills)
      via a study-specific test. Additionally, per ERCT rule, if criterion E is
      not met then criterion A is not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because the study did
      not use standardized all-subject exams and measured only estimation skills.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      There is no evidence of tracking participants to graduation, and criterion
      Y is not met.
    quote: >-
      "The short time of the intervention (restricted to 90 min) does not allow
      for capturing long-term learning gains" (p. 21)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The short time of the intervention (restricted to 90 min) does not allow
      for capturing long-term learning gains" (p. 21)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion G requires follow-up tracking until graduation, potentially
      in later follow-up papers by the same authors. The paper explicitly frames
      the intervention as short-term and notes it cannot capture long-term gains.
      An external search (by DOI, title, and author names) did not identify a
      follow-up publication tracking this cohort to graduation as of the ERCT
      check date. Per ERCT rule, if criterion Y is not met then criterion G is
      not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is not met because there is no
      graduation tracking evidence and year-long tracking is absent.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper does not report pre-registration, and no matching registry record
      was identified in an external search.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study was conducted in full accordance with the Declaration of
      Helsinki of 1975" (p. 22)

      2) "Written informed consent was obtained" (p. 22)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT criterion P requires a publicly accessible pre-registered protocol with
      registration dated before data collection starts. The paper reports ethics
      and consent information but does not provide a pre-registration identifier
      or registry link. An external search (by DOI, title, and author names) did
      not identify a public pre-registration record for this trial as of the ERCT
      check date.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is not met because no pre-
      registration statement or registry record was found.
