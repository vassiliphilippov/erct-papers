abstract: >-
  The study uses competitive admission lotteries at 24 oversubscribed U.S. public
  Montessori schools to estimate impacts of being offered a Montessori PK3 seat
  on end-of-kindergarten outcomes. The authors report positive impacts on
  reading and several cognitive outcomes, plus a cost analysis suggesting lower
  per-child costs versus traditional programs.

      Randomization was at the individual child level (lottery seats), not at the
      class or school level, and no tutoring-style exception applies.
    quote: >-
      "The study had individual-level random assignment within lottery blocks in
      which children were clustered for analyses."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We took advantage of random lotteries for admission to 24
      oversubscribed public Montessori schools across the United States to
      examine the impact of being offered a seat (intention-to-treat or ITT
      design) at PK3 (3 y old) on end of kindergarten (5 to 6 y old) outcomes."
      (p. 2)

      2) "The study had individual-level random assignment within lottery blocks
      in which children were clustered for analyses." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires the unit of randomization to be at least the class
      level (or school level, which also satisfies C), unless the intervention is
      inherently one-to-one tutoring or personal teaching. This study uses
      individual-level random assignment via school admission lotteries (children
      are offered or not offered a Montessori seat), explicitly stating
      "individual-level random assignment." The intervention is a preschool
      program model (Montessori) rather than a personal tutoring intervention, so
      the tutoring exception does not apply.

      Therefore, despite being a rigorous randomized design, the randomization
      unit is below class level, so Criterion C is not met.

      Final Summary: Criterion C is not met because assignment is individual,
      not class- or school-level.

      Outcomes were measured using widely used standardized assessments (e.g.,
      Woodcock-Johnson, HTKS, digit span), not custom tests created for the study.
    quote: >-
      "Children were individually tested by professional data collectors in the
      fall of 2021 and for the three subsequent springs (2022, 2023, 2024) on
      reading, vocabulary, math, executive function (HTKS), memory (forward and
      backward digit span)..."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Children were individually tested by professional data collectors in
      the fall of 2021 and for the three subsequent springs (2022, 2023, 2024)
      on reading, vocabulary, math, executive function (HTKS), memory (forward
      and backward digit span), persistence, social problem-solving, and social
      understanding (Theory of Mind Scale)..." (p. 9)

      2) "Age is factored into the Woodcock-Johnson Z score, acting as a built-in
      control." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires exam-based assessment using standardized, validated
      instruments rather than study-authored tests. The paper describes outcome
      measurement via established standardized assessments and tasks commonly
      used in education and developmental research (Woodcock-Johnson, HTKS, digit
      span, Theory of Mind Scale), and it explicitly references the
      Woodcock-Johnson Z score norming ("age is factored into" the score). The
      outcome battery is not presented as a bespoke test constructed to match the
      Montessori curriculum, and the measures listed are recognizable,
      standardized instruments.

      Therefore, Criterion E is met based on the use of standardized
      assessments.

      Final Summary: Criterion E is met because the study uses established,
      standardized assessment instruments rather than custom tests.

      The study tracked outcomes from baseline in fall 2021 through spring 2024,
      far exceeding one academic term.
    quote: >-
      "Children were tested at baseline (starting PK3) in the fall of 2021 and
      each subsequent spring through kindergarten (2024)."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Children were tested at baseline (starting PK3) in the fall of 2021
      and each subsequent spring through kindergarten (2024)." (p. 2)

      2) "Children were individually tested by professional data collectors in
      the fall of 2021 and for the three subsequent springs (2022, 2023, 2024)
      ..." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcomes to be measured at least one full academic
      term after the intervention begins. The paper states baseline testing in
      fall 2021 (start of PK3) and repeated spring assessments through 2024
      (end of kindergarten). This is multiple years of follow-up, so the
      minimum term-duration requirement is comfortably satisfied.

      Final Summary: Criterion T is met because tracking spans multiple years
      from fall 2021 through spring 2024.

      The control group is clearly defined as lottery non-winners, with sample
      sizes and alternative preschool enrollment described.
    quote: >-
      "Among the included 24 schools, 588 children were consented, 242 who won a
      seat and 346 who did not."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Among the included 24 schools, 588 children were consented, 242 who won
      a seat and 346 who did not." (p. 9)

      2) "Nearly half, 44.8%, of the control group attended other public
      programs (e.g., district public schools) in PK3. The remainder attended
      private preschool programs (13.6%) or stayed home (6.1%) at PK3; for 56
      children (16.2%) PK3 enrollment was unknown." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires a well-documented control group. The study defines
      controls as children not offered a Montessori seat via lottery, reports
      the control sample size (n = 346), and describes what control-group
      children did instead (other public programs, private preschool, stayed
      home, or unknown). This provides clear documentation of the control
      condition and the counterfactual experiences.

      Final Summary: Criterion D is met because the control group is explicitly
      defined and described, including alternative enrollments.

    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization occurred within lotteries at the child level rather than by
      random assignment of schools to conditions.
    quote: >-
      "The study had individual-level random assignment within lottery blocks in
      which children were clustered for analyses."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      oversubscribed public Montessori schools..." (p. 2)

      2) "The study had individual-level random assignment within lottery blocks
      in which children were clustered for analyses." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level randomization (schools assigned to
      treatment or control). Here, schools are sites from which lottery offers
      are made, but assignment is explicitly "individual-level" within lottery
      blocks. Therefore, this is not a school-level cluster randomized trial.

      Final Summary: Criterion S is not met because assignment is not at the
      school level.

      The intervention studied was a business-as-usual Montessori program model
      not designed by the research team.
    quote: >-
      "The findings are especially notable because this is a field study of a
      business-as-usual intervention that was not designed by the researchers:
      Montessori preschool in public U.S. schools."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The findings are especially notable because this is a field study of a
      business-as-usual intervention that was not designed by the researchers:
      Montessori preschool in public U.S. schools." (p. 9)

      2) "The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
      American Institutes for Research, Protocol 87236." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I focuses on independence from intervention designers to reduce
      bias. The paper explicitly states the program model evaluated was "not
      designed by the researchers" and describes it as a business-as-usual field
      setting. This directly supports the claim that the research team is not
      evaluating a researcher-created intervention, reducing the designer-led
      bias risk central to Criterion I.

      Final Summary: Criterion I is met because the paper explicitly states the
      intervention was not designed by the researchers.

      Outcomes were tracked from fall 2021 through spring 2024, spanning multiple
      academic years.
    quote: >-
      "Children were tested at baseline (starting PK3) in the fall of 2021 and

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Children were tested at baseline (starting PK3) in the fall of 2021
      and each subsequent spring through kindergarten (2024)." (p. 2)

      2) "Children were individually tested ... in the fall of 2021 and for the
      three subsequent springs (2022, 2023, 2024) ..." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires at least one full academic year between intervention
      start and outcome measurement. The study tracks children across PK3, PK4,
      and kindergarten, which is substantially longer than one academic year.

      Final Summary: Criterion Y is met because the follow-up window spans
      multiple academic years.

      The study explicitly evaluates the real-world Montessori program package
      (including its resource structure) against typical alternatives, making
      resource differences part of the treatment definition.
    quote: >-
      "Further, a cost analysis suggested three years of public Montessori
      preschool costs less per child than traditional programs, largely due to
      Montessori having higher child:teacher ratios in PK3 and PK4."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Further, a cost analysis suggested three years of public Montessori
      preschool costs less per child than traditional programs, largely due to
      Montessori having higher child:teacher ratios in PK3 and PK4." (p. 1)

      2) "The cost difference is primarily attributable to the intentionally
      higher child-to-adult ratios in Montessori classrooms at PK3 and PK4..."
      (p. 6)

      3) "We took advantage of random lotteries for admission to 24
      oversubscribed public Montessori schools..." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B asks whether time and resources are balanced across conditions
      unless the resource difference is itself integral to what is being tested.
      This study evaluates the impact of being offered a Montessori seat in
      public schools as they operate in practice. The paper emphasizes that
      Montessori has a distinct resource structure (notably child-to-adult
      ratios and overall costs), and it treats that structure as part of the
      program model being evaluated, including a dedicated cost analysis.

      Because the estimand is the real-world "Montessori seat offer" package
      relative to typical alternatives (the counterfactual experiences children
      would otherwise have), the relevant resource differences are not an
      incidental confound added on top of the pedagogy, but part of the
      intervention definition. Under the ERCT Criterion B exception logic, this
      supports marking B as met.

      Final Summary: Criterion B is met because the study explicitly evaluates a
      full program package where resource differences are integral to the
      treatment being tested.

    explanation: >-
      The paper reports that key findings replicate across multiple Montessori
      preschool RCTs, including at least one independent RCT in another context.
    quote: >-
      "This finding has replicated across all four recent RCTs examining the
      impact of public Montessori preschool..."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This finding has replicated across all four recent RCTs examining the
      impact of public Montessori preschool..." (p. 6)

      External Replication Evidence (other authors):

      2) Courtier, Gardes, & Noveck (2021) report that disadvantaged preschoolers
      "were randomly assigned" to Montessori vs. conventional classrooms.
      (Courtier et al., 2021, Child Development)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires independent replication by other researchers in other
      contexts. The paper itself states that the end-of-kindergarten early
      reading pattern "has replicated" across four recent Montessori preschool
      RCTs, indicating a replication literature for the intervention outcome
      pattern. Among the cited RCTs, at least one is led by a different author
      team in a different national context (e.g., Courtier et al., 2021, France),
      satisfying the "other authors, other context" requirement for replication.

      Therefore, Criterion R is met based on peer-reviewed randomized trials by
      other researchers that reproduce similar outcome patterns for Montessori
      preschool.

      Final Summary: Criterion R is met because independent Montessori preschool
      RCTs exist and the paper notes replication across multiple RCTs.

    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not assess effects across all core school subjects via
      standardized exam batteries; it reports a selected set of academic and
      nonacademic outcomes.
    quote: >-
      "In addition to examining a range of academic (reading, vocabulary, and
      math) and nonacademic ... outcomes..."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In addition to examining a range of academic (reading, vocabulary, and
      math) and nonacademic (executive function, memory, theory of mind,
      social problem-solving, and persistence) outcomes..." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all main
      subjects, to detect broad spillovers and displacement. The paper measures
      several academic domains (reading, vocabulary, math) plus multiple
      nonacademic outcomes, but it does not present a comprehensive
      all-subject standardized exam battery covering the full set of core school
      subjects. Given the criterion's intent, the outcome coverage is partial
      rather than all-subject.

      Final Summary: Criterion A is not met because the study does not measure a
      full all-subject standardized exam set.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes are tracked only through the end of kindergarten, and the authors
      explicitly note that longer-run impacts are unknown.
    quote: >-
      "We followed from age 3 through kindergarten..."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We followed from age 3 through kindergarten..." (p. 1)

      2) "Results Are End-of-Kindergarten. We do not know whether the study
      children will continue to do well in their later school years." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants through graduation. Although
      the study is longitudinal across preschool years, it ends at kindergarten
      and explicitly states that later outcomes are unknown. There is no
      evidence in the paper of tracking through later grades, let alone to
      graduation.

      Final Summary: Criterion G is not met because follow-up ends at
      kindergarten, not at graduation.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper reports registration on REES but does not provide a registration
      date relative to the study start, so pre-registration before data
      collection cannot be verified here.
    quote: >-
      "The analysis plan for this study was registered prior to examining PK3
      and later spring outcome data at the Registry of Efficacy and
      Effectiveness Studies in Education (REES) (#15183.1v4)..."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The analysis plan for this study was registered prior to examining
      PK3 and later spring outcome data at the Registry of Efficacy and
      Effectiveness Studies in Education (REES) (#15183.1v4)..." (p. 2)

      2) "Children were tested at baseline (starting PK3) in the fall of 2021..."
      (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the full study protocol be pre-registered before
      the study begins (before data collection starts). The paper states that an
      analysis plan was registered on REES and provides the registry identifier.
      However, the wording specifies registration prior to examining PK3 and
      later spring outcome data, not explicitly prior to study start or prior to
      baseline data collection (fall 2021). The paper does not include the REES
      registration date or a clear statement that registration occurred before
      baseline data collection began.

      Without a verifiable registry timestamp in the paper itself, the strict
      ERCT timing requirement cannot be confirmed from the provided materials.
      Therefore, this criterion is marked not met.

      Final Summary: Criterion P is not met because pre-registration before study
      start cannot be verified from the paper text provided.
