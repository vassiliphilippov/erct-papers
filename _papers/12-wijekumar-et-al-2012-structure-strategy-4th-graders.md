  Reading comprehension is a challenge for K-12 learners, especially with
  nonfiction texts. This paper reports on a large-scale randomized controlled
  efficacy trial with rural and suburban 4th-grade students using a web-based
  intelligent tutoring system (ITSS) to deliver explicit instruction in the
  structure strategy. Results showed statistically significant improvements on
  standardized and researcher-designed reading comprehension measures.

    explanation: >-
      They randomly assigned entire 4th-grade classrooms (teachers) within each
      school rather than splitting students within a single class.
    quote: >-
      "One hundred and thirty-one teachers’ classrooms were randomly assigned to
      experimental conditions… within schools." (Methods section)
    analysis: >-
      Quotes from the paper directly show that random assignment to intervention
      or control occurred at the classroom (teacher) level: “One hundred and
      thirty-one teachers’ classrooms were randomly assigned to experimental
      conditions (ITSS and control) within schools.” and “Within each
      participating school, all grade 4 teachers’ classrooms were randomly
      assigned…” This is clear evidence that entire classes served as the unit of
      randomisation, rather than assigning individual students within a class.
      Randomising at the classroom level avoids contamination of control
      students by intervention students seated together. This satisfies
      Class-level RCT, especially since the assignment was at the teacher/class
      level or stronger. Paragraph 2: The authors explicitly mention that they
      grouped schools with similar characteristics only if a school did not have
      enough classrooms. Hence, the essential randomisation unit was still the
      whole classroom, not individual students or small groups. There is no
      mention that the intervention was a personal one-to-one tutoring add-on for
      only some students; rather, entire classes were assigned to ITSS or to
      control conditions. Paragraph 3: Because the entire class was allocated,
      the C (Class-level RCT) requirement is fully met. This design also aligns
      with typical classroom-based experiments in which each teacher consistently
      implements the same approach with all students in that class.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They employed the Gray Silent Reading Test, a well-known standardized
      reading exam, alongside other measures.
    quote: >-
      "…the GSRT (Wiederholt and Blalock 2000) … was administered at pretest and
      post-test." (Methods section)
    analysis: >-
      The paper documents the use of the Gray Silent Reading Test (GSRT) as the
      standardized measure of reading comprehension for both pre- and post-
      tests: “…the GSRT (Wiederholt and Blalock 2000) form B was administered at
      pretest and Form A was administered at post-test.” Because the GSRT is widely
      recognized and commercially published, it counts as a standardized, exam-
      based assessment. In addition, the researchers developed
      experimenter-designed measures focusing on text structures such as
      problem-solution and comparison. Although these extra measures were
      custom-made, the presence of the GSRT means the study does use a recognized
      standardized exam. Consequently, the E (Exam-based Assessment) criterion is
      satisfied.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention spanned approximately 6–7 months, exceeding a typical 3–4
      month academic term.
    quote: >-
      "…students used the ITSS software for 6–7 months and then completed the post
      tests." (Methods section)
    analysis: >-
      The ERCT standard requires that the intervention last at least one full
      academic term (3–4 months). According to the paper, “students used the ITSS
      software for 6–7 months and then completed the post tests.” The authors note,
      “This research study is also the largest scale randomized controlled trial … we
      report on statistically significant findings from a large scale randomized
      controlled trial with rural and suburban 4th-grade students using ITSS… for
      6–7 months.” The 6–7 months of usage clearly exceeds a typical 3–4 month
      academic term.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They clearly report baseline equivalence, pretest comparisons, and standard
      language arts usage for the control group.
    quote: >-
      "Within each participating school, all grade 4 teachers’ classrooms were
      randomly assigned … The random assignment produced two groups that did not
      differ significantly…" (Methods section)
    analysis: >-
      For D (Documented Control Group), the standard requires clear description of
      control participants’ demographics, baseline performance, and the condition
      they experienced. The authors state: “The random assignment produced two
      groups that did not differ significantly on a pre-intervention measure of
      reading comprehension… or other characteristics.” This shows the authors
      compared the control group baseline with the treatment group. In the control
      condition, teachers “continued using the same language arts curriculum,” and
      “Total time for daily and weekly language arts instruction was to be identical
      for both the intervention and control classrooms.” Numeric details on the
      control group are provided in tables. Thus, D is met.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They did teacher-level randomization within schools, not full school-level
      assignment.
    quote: >-
      "…classrooms were randomly assigned to experimental conditions…within
      schools." (Methods section)
    analysis: >-
      To satisfy the S (School-level RCT) criterion, entire schools should be randomly
      assigned to intervention vs. control. In this study, they randomly assigned
      classrooms (teachers) within schools, as stated: “Within each participating
      school, all grade 4 teachers’ classrooms were randomly assigned…” This is not
      randomization at the whole-school level. The researchers aimed to maintain
      consistent curriculum within each school. Consequently, S is not met.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They only tested students in reading and did not measure other subjects’ outcomes
      (e.g. math, science).
    quote: >-
      "…the primary research question… focuses on reading comprehension measures only…"
      (Introduction and Methods sections)
    analysis: >-
      A (AllExams) requires the study to measure outcomes in all main subjects with
      standardized exams to evaluate potential negative effects on other areas. This
      paper focuses exclusively on reading comprehension. The primary research
      question is: do 4th grade classrooms using ITSS outperform control classrooms on
      reading comprehension measures? No mention is made of assessing math, science,
      or other subjects. Thus, A is not met.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention ran for about 6–7 months, not the full academic year.
    quote: >-
      "…used the ITSS software for 6–7 months and then completed the post tests."
      (Methods section)
    analysis: >-
      The Y (Year Duration) criterion requires a minimum one-year intervention. The
      study states that the intervention lasted “6–7 months,” which is shorter than a
      full academic year (often 9–10 months). Therefore, Y is not satisfied.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They did not allocate equivalent resources or tools to control classrooms; the
      intervention group had exclusive access to the ITSS system.
    quote: >-
      "…the control group continued using the same language arts curriculum… while
      the ITSS group used the web-based tutoring system for 30–45 min weekly."
      (Methods section)
    analysis: >-
      To meet B (Balanced Control Group), any extra budget, time, or resources given to
      the treatment group should also be allocated to the control group. Although the
      total instructional time was the same, the ITSS group received a specialized
      tutoring system that was not provided to the control group. Hence, B is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They only measured short-term outcomes after 6–7 months, without tracking
      participants until 4th-grade graduation or beyond.
    quote: >-
      "Finally, we report on statistically significant findings from a large scale
      randomized controlled efficacy trial … after 6–7 months…" (Abstract & Methods)
    analysis: >-
      The G (Graduation Tracking) criterion requires following participants until
      graduation from their current school level. In this study, outcomes were
      measured only after 6–7 months. There is no mention of tracking the students
      into subsequent grades or until graduation. Therefore, G is not satisfied.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent, external replication is described; references to earlier studies
      involve overlapping teams or pilot data.
    quote: >-
      "This is the first extension of the structure strategy to 4th grade… the largest
      randomized controlled trial to date…" (Introduction/Discussion)
    analysis: >-
      R (Reproduced) requires a fully independent replication by a different research
      team in a different setting. The paper references other structure strategy
      research, but these are not described as wholly independent replications with
      different investigators. No separate research group implemented the same
      intervention in a different location. Thus, R is not met.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention developers themselves led and carried out the trial without an
      external evaluation team.
    quote: >-
      "…the delivery of the structure strategy using a web-based intelligent tutoring
      system (ITSS) that has the potential… We report on statistically significant
      findings…" (Abstract/Introduction)
    analysis: >-
      For I (Independent Conduct), the study must be conducted by a team that is not
      the originator or promoter of the intervention. Here, the authors are the main
      developers or co-developers of the ITSS system, and they led the trial without an
      independent external evaluator. Thus, I is not met.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No mention is made of a pre-registration plan or publicly accessible protocol
      prior to data collection.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      P (Pre-Registered) requires a formal study protocol registered before data
      collection. The paper does not mention any pre-registration or prospective
      registration. Therefore, P is not met.
