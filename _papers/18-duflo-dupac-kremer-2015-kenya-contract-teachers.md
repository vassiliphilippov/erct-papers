abstract: >-
  This paper investigates a program under which randomly selected Kenyan schools
  were funded to hire an additional contract teacher, outside of the normal
  civil-service channels, alongside a parallel governance intervention that
  empowered parents in the hiring and monitoring process. The authors examine
  whether extra teachers and local governance reforms can work as complements
  in improving test scores and reducing class size. Results show a positive
  effect on test scores only for pupils assigned to locally hired contract
  teachers, especially when parents were formally empowered to supervise them.
  However, these short-term gains faded out once the intervention ended.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They conducted a randomized assignment of entire schools to the Extra
      Teacher Program, which meets or exceeds class-level RCT requirements.
    quote: >-
      “We set up an experiment… in the context of a randomized evaluation of the 
      Extra Teacher Program (ETP) implemented in Kenya between 2005 and 2007. The ETP 
      program provided 70 randomly selected school committees with funds to hire 
      supplemental teachers locally…” (pp. 93–94)
    analysis: >-
      The paper describes random assignment of 210 schools into 70 control vs 140 
      program schools. This cluster-randomized design is at least as 
      rigorous as class-level randomization. Therefore, criterion C is met.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They used a study-specific math and literacy test, not a widely recognized
      external standardized exam.
    quote: >-
      “Standardized tests covering math and literacy questions… were administered
      in all schools after 5 school terms… [T]rained enumerators and a separate
      team graded them.” (p. 97)
    analysis: >-
      Although tests were administered, they appear to be researcher-created
      rather than a widely recognized external exam. Thus, criterion E is not met.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention was implemented for substantially more than one academic term.
    quote: >-
      “All but two of the 70 schools… had a contract teacher in place by early May 
      2005… just before the program ended (November 2006).” (pp. 94, 97)
    analysis: >-
      The program started in early May 2005 and ran until November, 
      spanning roughly 18–19 months (over five school terms). Thus, criterion T is met.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They clearly described the control group’s composition, baseline data, and
      normal teaching practices.
    quote: >-
      “Background data… was collected in 2004… The 210 schools were randomly divided…
      70 schools formed the comparison group.” (p. 94, Table 1)
    analysis: >-
      The control group is well documented with baseline characteristics and usual
      practices. This satisfies criterion D.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They assigned entire schools to the program or control group, satisfying the 
      requirement for school-level randomization.
    quote: >-
      “The 210 schools were randomly divided into a comparison group (70 schools), 
      and an Extra Teacher Program (ETP) group (140 schools).” (p. 94)
    analysis: >-
      The unit of randomization was the school: 210 schools split into 70 control and 
      140 treatment. This clearly fulfills criterion S.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They only measured math and literacy outcomes, not all main subjects in the 
      curriculum.
    quote: >-
      “Standardized tests covering math and literacy questions… were administered in 
      all schools after 5 school terms…” (p. 97)
    analysis: >-
      The outcome assessment focused solely on math and literacy. No 
      science or other subjects were tested, thus criterion A is not met.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The program duration exceeded a full school year.
    quote: >-
      “…70 ETP schools… over the five school terms (corresponding to 15 months of 
      instruction) it operated.” (p. 96)
    analysis: >-
      The ETP intervention ran for five school terms (about one and a half years), 
      clearly longer than an academic year. Therefore, criterion Y is met.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The treatment schools received an extra teacher (reducing class size), whereas 
      control schools did not receive any equivalent resource.
    quote: >-
      “While average class size in grade 1 in 2005 in the comparison schools was 82, 
      it was only 42–44 in ETP schools.” (p. 95)
    analysis: >-
      The intervention added a teacher in treatment schools, roughly halving class 
      size, whereas control classes remained extremely large. No 
      compensating resource was given to control schools, so criterion B is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They tested students at 19 months and then a year later, but did not track
      them until primary school graduation.
    quote: >-
      “The same tests were administered again… one year after the program ended
      (November 2007).” (p. 99) No mention of following them through primary
      completion.
    analysis: >-
      Without tracking students until the end of primary school, criterion G is not
      satisfied.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They reference related studies but do not report an independent replication by 
      a separate research team.
    quote: >-
      “In contemporaneous work in India, Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2013) also 
      find that teachers reduce effort in response to hiring additional teachers.” 
      (p. 93)
    analysis: >-
      The authors cite similar findings in India, but this was a separate 
      experiment rather than a direct replication of their program. The paper provides 
      no evidence of any independent team reproducing the results, thus criterion R 
      was not met in the original study.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The researchers themselves designed and implemented the study without an 
      independent external team conducting the experiment.
    quote: >-
      “We set up an experiment… in the context of a randomized evaluation of the 
      Extra Teacher Program…” (p. 93) “…ICS staff met with the headmaster, the 
      teachers, and the parents… to explain how the program worked…” (p. 94)
    analysis: >-
      The phrase “We set up an experiment” indicates the authors’ active 
      role. Implementation was done through the NGO (ICS) as directed by the research 
      team. There was no independent organization running a separate evaluation, 
      so criterion I is not satisfied.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No mention is made of any pre-registration or a publicly accessible analysis
      plan.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      The absence of a pre-registered protocol means that criterion P is not met.
