abstract: >-
  Some education policymakers focus on bringing down pupil–teacher
  ratios. Others argue that resources will have limited impact without
  systematic reforms to education governance, teacher incentives, and
  pedagogy. We examine a program under which school committees at
  randomly selected Kenyan schools were funded to hire an additional
  teacher on an annual contract renewable conditional on performance,
  outside normal Ministry of Education civil-service channels, at one-
  quarter normal compensation levels. For students randomly assigned
  to stay with existing classes, test scores did not increase
  significantly, despite a reduction in class size from 82 to 44 on
  average. In contrast, scores increased for students assigned to be
  taught by locally-hired contract teachers. One reason may be that
  contract teachers had low absence rates, while centrally-hired
  civil-service teachers in schools randomly assigned contract
  teachers endogenously reduced their effort. Civil-service teachers
  also captured rents for their families, with approximately one-third
  of contract teacher positions going to relatives of existing
  teachers. A governance program that empowered parents within school
  committees reduced both forms of capture. The best contract teachers
  obtained civil-service jobs over time, and we estimate large
  potential dynamic benefits from supplementing a civil-service system
  with locally-hired contract teachers brought in on a probationary
  basis and granted tenure conditional on performance.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The 210 schools were randomly divided
      into a comparison group (70 schools), and an Extra Teacher Program (ETP) group (140 schools)." (p. 8)

      2) "Students and the contract teacher were then randomly
      allocated across sections." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomisation was implemented at the school level for the ETP
      intervention, assigning entire schools to treatment or control.
      Within treated schools, students were then randomly assigned to
      classes taught by contract or civil-service teachers. Under the
      ERCT standard, school-level randomisation meets or exceeds the
      requirement for class-level RCT.

      Final sentence explaining criterion C is met because
      randomisation was conducted at the school level, satisfying class-level RCT.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Standardized tests covering math and literacy questions
      ranging from identifying numbers and letters
      to subtracting two-digit numbers and writing words
      were administered in all schools after 5 school terms (19 months total, but only 15 months of instruction),
      just before the program ended (November 2006)." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Although described as "standardized tests," these instruments
      were created for this study rather than drawn from recognized
      national or state exams. No official standardized assessment (e.g.,
      KCPE) is cited.

      Final sentence explaining criterion E is not met because the study
      did not employ a widely recognised standardized exam.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Outcomes were measured after five school terms (~1.5 academic
      years) following the intervention start, exceeding the requirement
      to measure at least one full term after the intervention begins.

      Final sentence explaining criterion T is met because outcomes
      were measured more than one term after the intervention start.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The control (comparison) group is well documented in Table 1 with
      baseline demographics and school characteristics, and no special
      treatments beyond business-as-usual.

      Final sentence explaining criterion D is met because the control

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomisation at the level of entire schools satisfies the Level 2

      Detailed Analysis:

      Providing an extra teacher is the core treatment variable. Under
      the ERCT decision tree, when additional resources are the treatment,
      business-as-usual resourcing in the control group is acceptable.

      Final sentence explaining criterion B is met because the extra
      teacher is integral to the intervention and the control group
      received standard resourcing.

      1) "At the end of two years, students in schools with an extra
      contract teacher performed significantly better than those in
      comparison schools by 0.16σ and 0.15σ,"
      in math and language tests
      respectively." (Muralidharan & Sundararaman 2013)

      2) "In previous RCTs in India and Western Kenya,
      hiring contract teachers has been shown to improve test scores
      among primary school students." (World Bank 2012)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The positive impacts of this contract teacher intervention have
      been reproduced in other settings. For instance, a randomized
      study in India reported significant test score gains for students
      in schools that received an extra contract teacher. Additionally,
      a multi-district trial in Kenya found that contract teachers raised
      test scores when implemented by an NGO, mirroring the original
      study’s result.

      Final sentence explaining criterion R is met because there is
      evidence of independent replication of the results.
