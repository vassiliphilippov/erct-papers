abstract: >-
  Schools provide an ideal context for developing students’ leadership
  skills; however, most leadership opportunities (e.g., serving as class
  president) are typically offered to students who already demonstrate
  leadership qualities. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects
  of a school-based leadership program, implemented through a peer-led
  fundamental movement skills intervention, on the leadership abilities
  of student leaders (10–12 years) and the physical and psychological
  development of their younger peers (8–10 years). We conducted a
  cluster randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of the
  Learning to Lead program in 20 elementary schools in New South Wales,
  Australia (N = 1898 students). Leader outcomes included teacher-rated
  leadership effectiveness (the primary outcome), leadership ability,
  leadership self-efficacy, wellbeing, and observed time on-task in the
  classroom. Peer outcomes included school-based physical activity
  (accelerometers), object control motor competence (Test of Gross Motor
  Development-3), perceived motor competence, cardiorespiratory fitness
  (20-meter multi-stage fitness test), and muscular power (standing long
  jump). We observed statistically significant group-by-time effects for
  Leaders’ leadership effectiveness, wellbeing, and time spent on-task
  in the classroom. Statistically significant improvements in Peers’
  perceived motor competence, school-based physical activity, and
  cardiorespiratory fitness were also found. Our study demonstrated that
  a school-based leadership intervention has extensive benefits for the
  students delivering the program and those they taught.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Schools were randomized at the school level, which is stronger
      than class-level randomization and therefore satisfies Criterion C.
    quote: >-
      Schools were randomized at the school level to either
      intervention or waitlist control by an independent researcher via
      a computer-based random number generator.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In summary, we evaluated the L2L program using a two-arm
      cluster randomized controlled trial design in 20 elementary
      schools across two waves." (p. 3)

      2) "After collection of baseline data, schools were randomized to
      the L2L program, or a wait-list control." (p. 3)

      3) "Schools were randomized at the school level to either
      intervention or waitlist control by an independent researcher via
      a computer-based random number generator." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires that randomization be at the class level or
      stronger (e.g., school-level) to reduce contamination between
      treatment and control. The paper explicitly describes a cluster
      randomized controlled trial where "schools were randomized at the
      school level." Because school-level randomization is stronger than
      class-level randomization, this satisfies Criterion C.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is met because schools were the unit
      of randomization.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The outcomes are leadership, wellbeing, behavior, and physical
      activity/fitness measures, not standardized academic exams.
    quote: >-
      Teachers rated Leaders’ leadership skills using an adapted
      version of the Transformational Teaching Questionnaire
      (Beauchamp et al., 2010).
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Leader outcomes included teacher-rated leadership
      effectiveness (the primary outcome), leadership ability,
      leadership self-efficacy, wellbeing, and observed time on-task in
      the classroom." (p. 1)

      2) "Peer outcomes included school-based physical activity
      (accelerometers), object control motor competence (Test of Gross
      Motor Development-3), perceived motor competence,
      cardiorespiratory fitness (20-meter multi-stage fitness test), and
      muscular power (standing long jump)." (p. 1)

      3) "Teachers rated Leaders’ leadership skills using an adapted
      version of the Transformational Teaching Questionnaire
      (Beauchamp et al., 2010)." (p. 4)

      4) "Time On-Task in the Classroom. Trained research assistants
      conducted classroom observations using established methods
      (Alberto & Troutman, 2013)." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized exam-based assessment of
      educational (academic) outcomes (e.g., state/national standardized
      tests). The study’s measures are leadership questionnaires,
      classroom observation codes, accelerometry, and fitness/motor
      competence tests. While some instruments are standardized research
      tools in their domains, they are not standardized academic exams.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because the study does not
      use standardized academic exams for outcome assessment.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention began in Term 2 and outcomes were assessed at
      intervention end in late Term 3, which is at least one term later.
    quote: >-
      Assessments were conducted at 2 time points: baseline (late
      Term 1 to mid-Term 2; mid-March to June), prior to the
      commencement of the intervention, and intervention end (late
      Term 3; mid-August to September), immediately following the
      completion of the program.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Assessments were conducted at 2 time points: baseline (late
      Term 1 to mid-Term 2; mid-March to June), prior to the
      commencement of the intervention, and intervention end (late
      Term 3; mid-August to September), immediately following the
      completion of the program." (p. 3)

      2) "For Phase 2, in school Term 2 (i. e., 10-week period), the
      School Champions delivered 6 x 40-minute lessons to their classes
      of Leaders." (p. 3)

      3) "In Phase 3, Leaders were asked to deliver 12 x 30-minute
      fundamental movement skill sessions to Peers throughout Term 3."
      (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that outcomes be measured at least one full
      academic term after the intervention begins. The intervention
      starts in Term 2 (Phase 2), continues in Term 3 (Phase 3), and the
      intervention-end assessment occurs in late Term 3 (mid-August to
      September). This exceeds a term from the start of Term 2 to late
      Term 3.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is met because outcomes were assessed
      in late Term 3 after the intervention began in Term 2.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The wait-list control is described as continuing usual practice
      during Terms 2 and 3, with baseline characteristics reported for
      both groups.
    quote: >-
      During the intervention period (Terms 2 and 3), control schools
      continued with their usual practice, with teachers delivering
      their regular curriculum and classroom activities while
      intervention schools implemented the leadership lessons.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "After collection of baseline data, schools were randomized to
      the L2L program, or a wait-list control." (p. 3)

      2) "Schools allocated to the control condition in Waves 1 and 2
      received the program in Term 4 of 2022 and 2023, respectively."
      (p. 3)

      3) "During the intervention period (Terms 2 and 3), control
      schools continued with their usual practice, with teachers
      delivering their regular curriculum and classroom activities while
      intervention schools implemented the leadership lessons." (p. 3)

      4) "Participants' baseline characteristics are reported in
      Tables 1 and 2." (p. 6)

      5) "The flow of participants through the trial is displayed in
      Fig. 1." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control group be well documented,
      including what it received and key baseline/composition details.
      The paper describes a wait-list control that continued "usual
      practice" during the active intervention period, and it provides
      baseline characteristics (Tables 1 and 2) and participant flow
      (Fig. 1), allowing readers to assess comparability and attrition.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the control condition
      and baseline characteristics are clearly documented.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The unit of randomization was the school, satisfying Criterion S.
    quote: >-
      Schools were randomized at the school level to either
      intervention or waitlist control by an independent researcher via
      a computer-based random number generator.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In summary, we evaluated the L2L program using a two-arm
      cluster randomized controlled trial design in 20 elementary
      schools across two waves." (p. 3)

      2) "Schools were randomized at the school level to either
      intervention or waitlist control by an independent researcher via
      a computer-based random number generator." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the school (site)
      level. The paper explicitly states that schools were randomized at
      the school level, which directly satisfies this criterion.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is met because randomization occurred
      at the school level.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization involved an independent researcher, but the paper
      does not show a fully independent third-party evaluation team
      separate from the intervention developers.
    quote: >-
      An external change agent from the University of Newcastle was
      employed to support the program's implementation.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Schools were randomized at the school level to either
      intervention or waitlist control by an independent researcher via
      a computer-based random number generator." (p. 3)

      2) "All assessments were conducted at the study schools by trained
      research assistants." (p. 3)

      3) "An external change agent from the University of Newcastle was
      employed to support the program's implementation." (p. 3)

      4) "Their role included providing initial training at the full-day
      workshop and ongoing support to the School Champions throughout
      the intervention." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the evaluation be conducted
      independently from the intervention designers to reduce bias. The
      paper shows an "independent researcher" performed randomization,
      but the broader trial conduct (implementation support, data
      collection, and analysis) is not described as being performed by
      an external evaluation organization independent of the author
      group. The "external change agent" is from the University of
      Newcastle, which is also an author-affiliated institution.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because independent
      third-party evaluation conduct is not established.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention began in Term 2 and outcomes were assessed at
      intervention end in late Term 3, which is well under 75% of an
      academic year.
    quote: >-
      Assessments were conducted at 2 time points: baseline (late
      Term 1 to mid-Term 2; mid-March to June), prior to the
      commencement of the intervention, and intervention end (late
      Term 3; mid-August to September), immediately following the
      completion of the program.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "For Phase 2, in school Term 2 (i. e., 10-week period), the
      School Champions delivered 6 x 40-minute lessons to their classes
      of Leaders." (p. 3)

      2) "In Phase 3, Leaders were asked to deliver 12 x 30-minute
      fundamental movement skill sessions to Peers throughout Term 3."
      (p. 3)

      3) "Assessments were conducted at 2 time points: baseline (late
      Term 1 to mid-Term 2; mid-March to June), prior to the
      commencement of the intervention, and intervention end (late
      Term 3; mid-August to September), immediately following the
      completion of the program." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least 75% of one
      academic year after the intervention begins. Here, the program is
      delivered in Term 2 and Term 3, with the intervention-end
      assessment in late Term 3. This Term 2 → late Term 3 window is
      substantially shorter than three-quarters of a typical four-term
      school year.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because outcomes are
      assessed by late Term 3 rather than after ~75% of an academic year.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention provided substantial additional resources
      (workshop, equipment, implementation support) that were not
      matched in the control condition, and these extra inputs were not
      framed as the treatment variable.
    quote: >-
      In Phase 1, two Stage 3 teachers from each school attended a
      full-day workshop at the University of Newcastle to receive
      equipment and training to deliver L2L in their schools.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In Phase 1, two Stage 3 teachers from each school attended a
      full-day workshop at the University of Newcastle to receive
      equipment and training to deliver L2L in their schools." (p. 3)

      2) "An external change agent from the University of Newcastle was
      employed to support the program's implementation." (p. 3)

      3) "Their role included providing initial training at the full-day
      workshop and ongoing support to the School Champions throughout
      the intervention." (p. 3)

      4) "During the intervention period (Terms 2 and 3), control
      schools continued with their usual practice, with teachers
      delivering their regular curriculum and classroom activities while
      intervention schools implemented the leadership lessons." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B requires that time/resources be balanced between
      intervention and control, unless the study clearly frames the
      additional resources themselves as the treatment variable.

      Extra resources are clearly present in the intervention condition,
      including: (a) a full-day teacher workshop at a university, (b)
      provision of equipment and training, and (c) ongoing external
      change-agent implementation support. The control condition is
      described as "usual practice" during Terms 2 and 3, with no
      described equivalent professional development time, matched
      external support, or comparable substitute inputs.

      The paper frames the causal question as the effects of the L2L
      program, not as isolating the effect of "additional resources"
      alone. Under the ERCT Criterion B decision logic, when substantial
      extra resources exist, are not negligible, are not explicitly
      framed as the treatment variable, and are not matched in the
      control group, the criterion is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is not met because the intervention
      adds substantial resources that are not balanced in the control
      condition.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication by a separate research team was found
      for this specific Learning to Lead cluster RCT.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The present study builds on our previous pilot trial (Nathan
      et al., 2017), which examined the feasibility and acceptability of
      a peer-led leadership and fundamental movement skills program in a
      two elementary schools." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires a peer-reviewed replication of this study by
      an independent research team in a different context. The paper
      references an earlier pilot trial by related authors, but does not
      report an independent replication. An internet search for
      replication studies of this specific L2L cluster RCT by other
      author teams did not identify any such replication publications as
      of the ERCT check date.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because independent
      replication evidence was not found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Criterion E is not met (no standardized academic exams), so the
      all-subject standardized exam requirement cannot be satisfied.
    quote: >-
      Leader outcomes included teacher-rated leadership effectiveness
      (the primary outcome), leadership ability, leadership self-efficacy,
      wellbeing, and observed time on-task in the classroom.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Leader outcomes included teacher-rated leadership
      effectiveness (the primary outcome), leadership ability,
      leadership self-efficacy, wellbeing, and observed time on-task in
      the classroom." (p. 1)

      2) "Peer outcomes included school-based physical activity
      (accelerometers), object control motor competence (Test of Gross
      Motor Development-3), perceived motor competence,
      cardiorespiratory fitness (20-meter multi-stage fitness test), and
      muscular power (standing long jump)." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all
      main school subjects, and ERCT rules specify that if Criterion E is
      not met, Criterion A is not met. This study does not use
      standardized academic exams in any subject area.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because standardized
      exam-based assessment is not used (and Criterion E is not met).
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not track participants through graduation, and
      Criterion Y is not met which also forces Criterion G to be not met.
    quote: >-
      Firstly, the outcomes were measured relatively shortly after the
      end of the intervention, which may limit the conclusions regarding
      the longevity of the observed effects.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Assessments were conducted at 2 time points: baseline (late
      Term 1 to mid-Term 2; mid-March to June), prior to the
      commencement of the intervention, and intervention end (late
      Term 3; mid-August to September), immediately following the
      completion of the program." (p. 3)

      2) "Firstly, the outcomes were measured relatively shortly after
      the end of the intervention, which may limit the conclusions
      regarding the longevity of the observed effects." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking students until graduation, and ERCT
      rules specify that if Criterion Y (year duration) is not met, then
      Criterion G is not met. The paper reports only baseline and
      intervention-end assessments, and explicitly notes that outcomes
      were measured relatively shortly after the intervention ended.
      There is no mention in this paper of tracking students to
      graduation. An internet search for subsequent follow-up papers by
      the same author team reporting graduation tracking for this cohort
      did not identify any such publications as of the ERCT check date.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because the study does not
      report graduation tracking (and Y is not met).
  p:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The trial was prospectively registered (ACTRN12621000376842) with
      a registration date preceding first participant enrolment.
    quote: >-
      Our study was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical
      Trials Registry (registration number: ACTRN12621000376842).
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Our study was registered with the Australian New Zealand
      Clinical Trials Registry (registration number: ACTRN12621000376842)."
      (p. 3)

      2) "The trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New
      Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (registration number:
      ACTRN12621000376842) and a detailed protocol was published prior
      to data analysis (Wade et al., 2023)." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the study protocol be pre-registered
      before the study begins. The paper explicitly states the trial was
      registered on ANZCTR and provides the registration number.

      Registry Verification (ANZCTR):

      1) "Date registered 1/04/2021" (ANZCTR record for
      ACTRN12621000376842)

      2) "Date of first participant enrolment ... Actual 6/04/2022"
      (ANZCTR record for ACTRN12621000376842)

      Because the ANZCTR registration date (April 1, 2021) is before the
      first participant enrolment date (April 6, 2022), the protocol was
      registered prospectively relative to study start.

      Final sentence: Criterion P is met because the trial was
      prospectively registered prior to first participant enrolment.
