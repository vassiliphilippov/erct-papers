abstract: >-
  This study reports a randomized, controlled trial measuring college
  students' learning and their perceptions when content is presented
  through an AI-powered tutor compared with an active learning class.
  We find that students learn significantly more in less time when
  using the AI tutor, compared with the in-class active learning. They
  also feel more engaged and more motivated. These findings offer
  empirical evidence for the efficacy of a widely accessible
  AI-powered pedagogy in significantly enhancing learning outcomes.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study uses a randomized cross-over design at the
      peer-group level (student level), which is acceptable under the
      ERCT exception for personal tutoring interventions.
    quote: >-
      "Students were randomly assigned to two groups, respecting the
      constraint that students who regularly worked together in class
      during peer instruction were placed in the same group..." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students were randomly assigned to two groups, respecting the
      constraint that students who regularly worked together in class
      during peer instruction were placed in the same group in order to
      maximize the effectiveness of their in-class learning." (p. 7)

      2) "The structure of the experimental condition differed from the
      control condition in that all interactions and feedback were with
      an Al tutor, rather than with peer-instruction followed by
      instructor feedback." (p. 8)

      3) "Working with an expert personal tutor is generally regarded
      as the most efficient form of education... What if an AI tutor
      could mimic the learning experience one would get from an expert
      (human) tutor?" (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study randomizes students (grouped by their small peer
      instruction clusters) to either the AI condition or the in-class
      condition. While this is technically not a "Class-level"
      randomization (as it occurs within a single course), the ERCT
      standard provides an exception for interventions designed for
      personal teaching or tutoring. The paper explicitly frames the
      intervention as "AI tutoring" intended to mimic "one-on-one
      tutoring." Therefore, the student-level (or small group-level)
      randomization is acceptable under the exception.

      Final sentence: The criterion is met because the intervention is
      a personal tutoring tool, allowing for the student-level
      randomization exception.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured using custom pre- and post-tests designed
      for the specific lessons, not standardized exam-based
      assessments.
    quote: >-
      "Following each lesson, students completed post-tests to measure
      content mastery..." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To establish baseline knowledge, students from both groups
      completed a pre-test prior to each lesson... Following each
      lesson, students completed post-tests to measure content mastery"
      (p. 2)

      2) "To prevent the specific test questions from influencing the
      teaching or Al tutor design, the tests were constructed by a
      separate team member... tests were written based on the learning
      goals for the lesson" (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study uses custom-created quizzes (pre- and post-tests) that
      are specific to the two lessons (surface tension and fluid flow).
      While the authors used the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) for
      baseline characterization, the FCI was not the outcome measure for
      the intervention. The standard requires widely recognized,
      standardized exams to measure the educational outcome. Custom
      lesson-aligned tests do not meet this requirement.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met because the study relies
      on custom-designed post-tests rather than standardized exams to
      measure learning outcomes.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured immediately following two single-lesson
      interventions, falling far short of the one-term duration
      requirement.
    quote: >-
      "The study took place during one of the two meeting of the class
      during the ninth and tenth weeks of the course." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study took place during one of the two meeting of the
      class during the ninth and tenth weeks of the course." (p. 7)

      2) "Following each lesson, students completed post-tests..." (p.
      2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention consisted of two specific lessons occurring in
      consecutive weeks. The measurement (post-test) occurred
      immediately after each lesson. The ERCT standard requires that
      outcomes be measured at least one full academic term after the
      intervention begins. Here, the measurement was immediate, and the
      total duration of the study interaction was only two weeks.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met because the interval
      between the start of the intervention and the measurement of
      outcomes was less than one academic term.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control group (in-class active learning) is well-documented,
      including pedagogy, student demographics, and baseline knowledge.
    quote: >-
      "All in-class lessons employed research-based best practices for
      in-class active learning." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "All in-class lessons employed research-based best practices
      for in-class active learning... First the instructor introduces
      an activity, then students work through the activity in
      self-selected groups..." (p. 7)

      2) "The demographics of the two groups were comparable (see table
      S2A), as were previous measures of their physics background
      knowledge" (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper provides a detailed description of the control condition,
      which is the standard "in-class active learning" format for the
      course. It describes the structure (intro, group work, feedback),
      the qualifications of the instructors, and the baseline
      characteristics of the students in that group (via FCI and CLASS
      scores). This satisfies the requirement for a documented control
      group.

      Final sentence: The criterion is met as the paper clearly documents
      the control group's composition, baseline characteristics, and
      instructional conditions.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study was conducted within a single university course, not
      randomized across multiple schools or institutions.
    quote: >-
      "The present study took place during the Fall 2023 semester in
      Physical Sciences 2 (PS2)... is Harvard's largest physics class"
      (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The present study took place during the Fall 2023 semester in
      Physical Sciences 2 (PS2)... at Harvard University" (p. 7)

      2) "Students were randomly assigned to two groups... within the
      course" (implied, p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study was localized to one specific course at one university.
      To meet the School-level RCT criterion, randomization must occur
      among different schools or distinct educational sites.
      Randomizing peer groups within a single lecture course does not
      meet this threshold.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met because randomization
      occurred within a single course rather than across multiple
      schools or sites.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study was designed, conducted, and analyzed by the authors,
      including the course instructors, without independent third-party
      conduct.
    quote: >-
      "Author contributions... Methodology: G.K., K.M., A.K., G.P. ...
      Validation: G.K., K.M. Formal Analysis: G.K., K.M." (p. 9)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Author contributions: Conceptualization: G.K., K.M., A.K.,
      T.W.M. Methodology: G.K., K.M., A.K., G.P. Software
      Conceptualization and Design: G.K." (p. 9)

      2) "Videos were produced... and the instructor (GK) has a decade
      of experience..." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The primary authors (G.K. and K.M.) were responsible for the
      software design, the methodology, the validation, and the formal
      analysis. G.K. is also identified as an instructor. There is no
      evidence of an external evaluation agency or independent researchers
      conducting the data collection or analysis.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met because the intervention
      designers and course instructors were responsible for conducting
      and analyzing the study.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured over a two-week period, not tracked for a
      full academic year.
    quote: >-
      "The study took place during one of the two meeting of the class
      during the ninth and tenth weeks of the course." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study took place during one of the two meeting of the
      class during the ninth and tenth weeks of the course." (p. 7)

      2) "We have found that when students interact with our Al tutor...
      they learn significantly more... than when they engage with the
      same content during an in-class active learning lesson" (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The Year Duration criterion requires outcomes to be measured at
      least one full academic year after the intervention starts. This
      study focuses on immediate learning gains from two specific
      lessons. There is no longitudinal tracking mentioned that spans
      an academic year.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met because the study duration
      and follow-up did not span a full academic year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention replaced the control activity without adding extra
      time; in fact, the intervention group spent less time on task than
      the control group.
    quote: >-
      "The median time on task for students in the Al group was 49
      minutes." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "During a 75-minute period, the in-class students spent 15
      minutes taking the pre- and post-tests; we assume 60 minutes
      spent on learning." (p. 2)

      2) "The median time on task for students in the Al group was 49
      minutes." (p. 2)

      3) "70% of students in the Al group spent less than 60 minutes on
      task" (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study compares two modes of instruction: AI tutoring vs.
      In-class active learning. The control group utilized human
      resources (instructors/TAs) and spent approximately 60 minutes on
      learning. The intervention group utilized software (AI) and spent
      a median of 49 minutes. The intervention did not add extra time
      or budget that was unbalanced; if anything, the intervention was
      more time-efficient. The "resources" (AI vs Humans) defines the
      treatment variable itself. There is no evidence that the
      treatment group received "extra" help (like double dosing) that
      the control didn't.

      Final sentence: The criterion is met because the intervention did
      not require additional time or non-integral resources compared to
      the control group; outcome differences cannot be attributed to
      extra time on task.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent peer-reviewed replication of this specific AI
      tutoring intervention was found.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      (No quotes in the paper describe an independent replication).

      Detailed Analysis:

      A search for "Kestin AI tutor Harvard replication" and related
      terms yielded no independent studies published in peer-reviewed
      journals that replicate this specific experiment. As the paper is
      published in 2025 and describes a novel design, it appears to be
      the primary source. The ERCT standard requires an independent
      replication to meet this criterion.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met because no independent
      replication of the study has been published.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study only assessed physics content knowledge, not all main
      subjects.
    quote: >-
      "focusing on surface tension in the first week and fluid flow in
      the second." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "focusing on surface tension in the first week and fluid flow
      in the second." (p. 2)

      2) "post-tests to measure content mastery" (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study focuses exclusively on Physics (specifically two topics
      within it). It does not assess Math, English, or other main
      subjects. Furthermore, since criterion E (Exam-based Assessment)
      was not met, criterion A is automatically not met as per the
      standard instructions.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met because assessment was
      limited to specific physics topics and did not cover all main
      subjects using standardized exams.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study tracks learning only for the duration of the lessons and
      does not follow students to graduation.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      (No quotes in the text mention tracking to graduation).

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper reports on immediate post-test scores and student
      perceptions collected during the semester. There is no mention of
      tracking students until they graduate from the university. Given
      the recent publication date (2025), long-term graduation tracking
      is unlikely to have occurred or been reported yet.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met because there is no
      evidence of tracking participants until graduation.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study mentions IRB approval but does not provide evidence of
      a pre-registered protocol on a public registry.
    quote: >-
      "The present study was approved by the Harvard University IRB
      (study no. IRB23-0797)..." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The present study was approved by the Harvard University IRB
      (study no. IRB23-0797) and followed a crossover design." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      While the study cites IRB approval, this is not the same as
      pre-registration of the analysis plan and hypotheses. A search of
      standard registries (OSF, ClinicalTrials.gov) for the specific
      authors and study description did not yield a pre-registered
      protocol stamped prior to data collection. The paper does not
      contain a statement linking to a pre-registration.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met because there is no
      documented pre-registered protocol.
