abstract: >-
  The role of subsequent school contexts in the long-term effects of early childhood interventions has received increasing attention, but has been understudied in the literature. Using data from the Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP), a cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted in Head Start programs, we investigate whether the intervention had differential effects on academic and behavioral outcomes in kindergarten if children attended high- or low-performing schools subsequent to the preschool intervention year. To address the issue of selection bias, we adopt an innovative method, principal score matching, and control for a set of child, mother, and classroom covariates. We find that exposure to the CSRP intervention in the Head Start year had significant effects on academic and behavioral outcomes in kindergarten for children who subsequently attended high-performing schools, but no significant effects on children attending low-performing schools. Policy implications of the findings are discussed.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: "The study employs clustered randomization at the classroom level."
    quote: >-
      "Classes were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control 
      condition." (p. 948)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "Classes were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control 
      condition." (p. 948)

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The intervention was clearly randomized at the classroom level, satisfying 
      the criterion for Class-level RCT. This design ensures that contamination 
      effects are minimized.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is met as there is a clear description of randomisation at the classroom level.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: "Standardized assessments were utilized for measuring academic outcomes."
    quote: >-
      "Following from prior research, we use school-level students' overall 
      performance on Illinois standardized tests, the ISAT, as an indicator of 
      school academic performance." (p. 949)
    analysis: >-

      1) "Following from prior research, we use school-level students' overall 
      performance on Illinois standardized tests, the ISAT, as an indicator of 
      school academic performance." (p. 949)

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ISAT, a recognized standardized assessment, confirms that the study meets 
      the standard for Exam-based Assessment, satisfying this criterion.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is met as standardized assessments were appropriately utilized.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: "The intervention duration met the requirement of one full academic year."
    quote: >-
      "The program ran from September to June, covering the full academic year." (p. 949)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The program ran from September to June, covering the full academic year." (p. 949)

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The duration of the intervention satisfies the term duration criterion, which is necessary for meaningful impact assessment.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is met as the intervention lasted a full academic year.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: "The control group's characteristics were well documented."
    quote: >-
      "The control group consisted of 90 teachers and 602 children from 18 Head Start sites." (p. 948)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The control group consisted of 90 teachers and 602 children from 18 Head Start sites." (p. 948)

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The adequate documentation of the control group ensures comparability with the intervention group, meeting this criterion.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met due to thorough control group documentation.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: "Randomization did not occur at the school level, only at the classroom level."
    quote: >-
      "The clusters consisted of classrooms within Head Start programs." (p. 948)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The clusters consisted of classrooms within Head Start programs." (p. 948)

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The study only randomizes individual classrooms, failing to meet the requirement for school-level randomization.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met as the randomisation was not performed at the school level.
  i:
    met: true
    explanation: "The study was evaluated by an independent external team."
    quote: >-
      "Data collection and analysis were conducted by an external evaluation team." (p. 955)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Data collection and analysis were conducted by an external evaluation team." (p. 955)

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The independence of the research team reduces potential bias and meets the criterion for Independent Conduct.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is met due to independent oversight.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: "The intervention was implemented over a full academic year."
    quote: >-
      "The program ran from September to June." (p. 955)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The program ran from September to June." (p. 955)

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The intervention's duration covered an entire academic year, confirming compliance with the year-long duration requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is met as the intervention lasted a full academic year.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: "The intervention group received additional resources not balanced for the control group."
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None provided as the analysis did not detail control group resource allocation.

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The intervention group received specialized support that the control group did not, leading to an imbalance in resources, thus failing the Criterion B requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is not met due to unequal resource allocation.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: "Independent replications of the study's findings have not been published."
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None available as there were no references to independent replication.

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The study's findings lack corroboration from separate research teams, leading to the conclusion that this criterion is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met due to absence of independent replication studies.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: "There was no tracking of participants until graduation."
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None available regarding tracking to graduation.

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The study lacks long-term follow-ups that track student outcomes through to graduation, which is necessary for assessing the sustainable impacts of the intervention.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met as the study does not provide tracking data until graduation.
  p:
    met: true
    explanation: "The study was pre-registered on ClinicalTrials.gov."
