abstract: >-
  In a randomized field trial with 2,850 seventh-grade mathematics
  students, we evaluated whether an educational technology
  intervention increased mathematics learning. Assigning homework is
  common yet sometimes controversial. Building on prior research on
  formative assessment and adaptive teaching, we predicted that
  combining an online homework tool with teacher training could
  increase learning. The online tool ASSISTments (a) provides timely
  feedback and hints to students as they do homework and (b) gives
  teachers timely, organized information about students’ work. To test
  this prediction, we analyzed data from 43 schools that participated
  in a random assignment experiment in Maine, a state that provides
  every seventh-grade student with a laptop to take home. Results
  showed that the intervention significantly increased student scores
  on an end-of-the-year standardized mathematics assessment as
  compared with a control group that continued with existing homework
  practices. Students with low prior mathematics achievement benefited
  most. The intervention has potential for wider adoption.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Randomization occurred at the class (school) level, avoiding
      within-class mixing and meeting the class-level RCT standard.
    quote: >
      “We investigated this question through a randomized controlled
      experiment in which schools were assigned to either an intervention
      or a business-as-usual condition.” (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “We investigated this question through a randomized
      controlled experiment in which schools were assigned to either
      an intervention or a business-as-usual condition.” (p. 3)

      2) “All schools that successfully completed an application were
      accepted into the study and randomly assigned to a condition,
      as described later.” (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper clearly states that entire schools (and thus all their
      classes) were randomly assigned to treatment or control. This
      prevents any contamination within classes and satisfies the
      ERCT “Class-level RCT” requirement.

      Final sentence:

      Criterion C is met because randomization was done at the
      class/school level rather than at the student level.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Student learning was measured with the TerraNova standardized
      test, a well‑established, nationally normed exam.
    quote: >
      “To measure students’ levels of achievement at the end of the
      intervention, we administered the TerraNova standardized test.
      We chose TerraNova because it has well‑established and
      reputable psychometric qualities.” (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “To measure students’ levels of achievement at the end of the
      intervention, we administered the TerraNova standardized test.
      We chose TerraNova because it has well‑established and
      reputable psychometric qualities.” (p. 5)

      2) “Scores from the TerraNova Common Core assessment
      mathematics test were used as a primary outcome measure to
      provide data on student achievement in mathematics concepts,
      processes, and skills, and the test was administered at the end of
      students’ seventh-grade year.” (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study used a widely recognized, normed standardized exam
      (TerraNova) rather than a custom instrument. This ensures
      objective, comparable assessment across groups.

      Final sentence:

      Criterion E is met because a standard exam was employed.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The intervention spanned a full academic year of seventh-grade
      instruction, exceeding the one-term minimum.
    quote: >
      “We investigated what happened when teachers in Maine were
      newly trained to use ASSISTments and then deployed it with
      all their students throughout a full year of seventh-grade
      mathematics instruction.” (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “We investigated what happened when teachers in Maine were
      newly trained to use ASSISTments and then deployed it with
      all their students throughout a full year of seventh-grade
      mathematics instruction.” (p. 3)

      2) “As planned and executed, this experiment required that
      schools remain in the condition for 2 years and provide student
      data in the second year.” (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The program was implemented over at least one full school year
      (and data were gathered in the second year), far surpassing the
      one-term requirement.

      Final sentence:

      Criterion T is met because the trial lasted a full academic year.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The control group’s practices, demographics, and baseline scores
      are clearly documented for proper comparison.
    quote: >
      “In the control group, teachers continued with their existing
      homework practices without any specific teacher training beyond
      that offered by their districts.” (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “In the control group, teachers continued with their existing
      homework practices without any specific teacher training beyond
      that offered by their districts.” (p. 5)

      2) “Control group teachers were not able to use ASSISTments with
      seventh-grade students.” (p. 5)

      3) “The data included students’ achievement on the New England
      Common Assessment Program (NECAP) test for reading and
      mathematics. The data also included demographic indicators,
      such as gender, FRL status, and IEP status.” (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper reports the control group’s condition (business-as-usual),
      collected baseline test scores, and student demographics, ensuring
      full documentation of the control group.

      Final sentence:

      Criterion D is met because the control group is well described.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Entire schools (not just classes) were randomized, satisfying the
      school-level RCT requirement.
    quote: >
      “We investigated this question through a randomized controlled
      experiment in which schools were assigned to either an intervention
      or a business-as-usual condition.” (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “We investigated this question through a randomized
      controlled experiment in which schools were assigned to either
      an intervention or a business-as-usual condition.” (p. 3)

      2) “Most schools were placed into pairs prior to randomization,
      and we proceeded with random assignment.” (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomization occurred at the school level (43 schools), not merely
      within classes, ensuring a realistic, whole-school implementation
      scenario.

      Final sentence:

      Criterion S is met because the unit of randomization is the school.
  i:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      An independent research team evaluated the intervention, and no
      authors had a financial interest in ASSISTments.
    quote: >
      “None of the authors has a financial interest in ASSISTments.” (p. 11)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Worcester Polytechnic Institute provided the ASSISTments
      intervention—comprising the technology and closely related
      professional development—to schools, teachers, and students for
      this study.” (p. 3)

      2) “None of the authors has a financial interest in ASSISTments.”
      (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The tool was supplied by its creators (WPI), but the independent
      evaluation was done by researchers with no financial stake,
      ensuring unbiased data collection and analysis.

      Final sentence:

      Criterion I is met because evaluation was conducted independently.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The trial ran for a full academic year (with data from the second
      year cohort), meeting the one‑year duration requirement.
    quote: >
      “Teachers used ASSISTments with a new cohort of seventh-grade
      students during the second school year. Scores from this second
      cohort of students were used for our analysis of the impact on
      student learning.” (p. 5)

      2) “As planned and executed, this experiment required that
      schools remain in the condition for 2 years and provide student
      data in the second year.” (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Students experienced the intervention for an entire school year,
      satisfying the ERCT year‑long duration criterion.

      Final sentence:

      Criterion Y is met because the intervention covered a full year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Both groups followed identical homework policies and content;
      the ASSISTments tool and training were the core treatment.
    quote: >
      “Both teacher groups were expected to assign and review
      mathematics homework for seventh-grade students in accordance
      with their local school policies.” (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Both teacher groups were expected to assign and review
      mathematics homework for seventh-grade students in accordance
      with their local school policies.” (p. 5)

      2) “As previously described, the content of the homework in both
      groups came from the textbooks already in use at each school.”
      (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The only difference was the ASSISTments platform and training,
      which were the intervention’s core. No extra time or budget was
      given aside from the intended treatment.

      Final sentence:

      Criterion B is met because resources and time were balanced.
  r:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      An independent replication by another research team found
      similar positive results, confirming the original findings.
    quote: >
      “Students at intervention schools performed significantly better than
      those in the comparison group on 8th grade End-of-Grade math tests
      one year after the program (p = 0.011, g = 0.10).” (Feng et al., 2023)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Students at intervention schools performed significantly better than
      those in the comparison group on 8th grade End-of-Grade math tests
      one year after the program (p = 0.011, g = 0.10).” (Feng et al., 2023)

      Detailed Analysis:

      A large-scale replication in 63 North Carolina middle schools (with a new,
      independent research team) also found a significant improvement in math
      test scores for students using ASSISTments one year later. This confirms
      that the original positive effect was reproducible in a different population
      and setting, strengthening confidence in the results.

      Final sentence:

      Criterion R is met because an independent study validated the findings.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Only mathematics achievement was assessed; other subjects were
      not tested.
    quote: >
      “Scores from the TerraNova Common Core assessment mathematics
      test were used as a primary outcome measure to provide data on
      student achievement in mathematics concepts, processes, and
      skills.” (p. 6)

      mathematics test were used as a primary outcome measure to
      provide data on student achievement in mathematics concepts,
      processes, and skills.” (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention’s impact was measured only in math. No
      standardized tests in reading, science, or other core subjects were
      administered, failing the all‑subject exams requirement.

      Final sentence:

      Criterion A is not met because only one subject was assessed.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Students were originally tracked only through 7th grade;
      a separate follow-up measured outcomes at the end of 8th grade,
      but tracking did not extend to high school graduation.
    quote: >
      “A follow-up study was designed to measure the long-term impact of ASSISTments on student learning in 2021,
      one year after the intervention was over.” (Feng et al., 2023)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “A follow-up study was designed to measure the long-term impact of ASSISTments on student learning in 2021,
      one year after the intervention was over.” (Feng et al., 2023)

      Detailed Analysis:

      This follow-up indicates the intervention’s impact persisted one year post-intervention (end of 8th grade). However,
      students were not tracked beyond middle school, meaning their high school outcomes (graduation or otherwise) remain unknown.
      Therefore, long-term tracking in the sense of following through graduation is absent.

      Final sentence:

      Criterion G is not met because participants were not tracked until graduation.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study was not pre-registered; no registry or preregistration
      statement is provided.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper does not mention any pre‑registration of hypotheses,
      methods, or analysis plans before data collection. Therefore,
      transparency via preregistration is lacking.

      Final sentence:

      Criterion P is not met because there is no preregistration.
