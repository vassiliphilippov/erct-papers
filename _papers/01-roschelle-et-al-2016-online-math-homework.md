abstract: >-
  In a randomized field trial with 2,850 seventh-grade mathematics students, 
  the authors evaluated whether an educational technology intervention (ASSISTments) 
  increased mathematics learning when used for homework. The intervention provided 
  automated feedback and hints for students, while delivering organized performance 
  data to teachers so they could adapt their instruction. Results showed significant 
  gains in math test scores, especially for students with lower prior achievement.

  c:
    met: true
    explanation: "Randomization was conducted among entire schools, which meets or exceeds the class-level requirement."
    quote: "\"Schools were placed into pairs ... and pairs were randomly assigned to treatment and control.\" (p. 6)"
    analysis: >-
      First, we look for evidence that the paper used a class-level (or stronger) 
      randomization rather than randomizing students within the same classroom. The 
      paper states: "We investigated this question through a randomized controlled 
      experiment in which schools were assigned to either an intervention or a 
      business-as-usual condition." (p. 2). Also: "Schools were placed into pairs 
      with similar prior achievement levels and enrollment sizes, and pairs were 
      randomly assigned to treatment and control." (p. 6) These quotes confirm that 
      randomization took place at the school level, which is stronger than 
      class-level randomization.
      
      Because the randomization was performed at the school level, there is no risk 
      of contamination within the same classroom, and it also automatically meets 
      the weaker requirement of class-level randomization. The authors clearly 
      describe how schools—rather than individual students—were assigned, noting 
      that this was a 'school-level RCT.'
      
      Therefore, since randomization was not student-level within a single 
      classroom, and the authors do not rely on a one-to-one tutoring exception, 
      the Class-level RCT criterion (C) is satisfied by virtue of their stronger 
      design.

  e:
    met: true
    explanation: "They used the TerraNova standardized test, which is externally developed and widely recognized."
    quote: "\"Scores from the TerraNova Common Core assessment mathematics test were used as a primary outcome measure...\" (p. 5)"
    analysis: >-
      Next, we consider whether the paper used an exam-based assessment. The 
      authors explicitly mention: "...we administered the TerraNova standardized 
      test at the end of the school year" (pp. 5–6). They also describe TerraNova 
      as having "well-established and reputable psychometric qualities" (p. 5). 
      They thus employed a standardized, widely recognized exam rather than a 
      custom-made test.
      
      This meets the requirement for an exam-based assessment (E), since TerraNova 
      is a standard assessment widely used in multiple contexts. The study did not 
      rely on a researcher-designed test solely aligned to the intervention.
      
      Hence, the exam-based assessment criterion is clearly fulfilled.

  t:
    met: true
    explanation: "They used the tool for the entire school year, which is longer than a standard term."
    quote: "\"...the project collected data in the second year of implementation... The test was administered near the end of the school year.\" (p. 4)"
    analysis: >-
      For T (Term duration), the intervention must last at least a full academic 
      term (often 3–4 months). In this study, the authors indicate the 
      intervention was implemented for a full school year: "Teachers used 
      ASSISTments with a new cohort of seventh-grade students during the second 
      school year. Scores from this second cohort ... were used ... at the end 
      of seventh-grade." (pp. 3–4). This intervention period, which spanned most 
      or all of the academic year, far exceeds a single term.
      
      Moreover, teachers had a 'warm-up year' and then a subsequent year in which 
      student outcomes were measured. This well exceeds the minimal requirement of 
      a one-term duration. Therefore, T is satisfied.
      
      No quotes suggest a shorter intervention window. Instead, the study covers 
      an entire seventh-grade academic cycle with professional development starting 
      the summer before the school year. Thus, T is met.

  d:
    met: true
    explanation: "They provide demographics, baseline tests, and a clear description of the control group's business-as-usual approach."
    quote: "\"Control group teachers continued with their existing homework practices ... we analyzed data from 43 schools...\" (pp. 2–3, 4–5, Table 1)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion D (Documented control group) requires the study to clearly describe 
      the control group's composition, baseline characteristics, and confirm the 
      'business-as-usual' condition. The authors note: "As discussed, schools were 
      placed into pairs with similar prior achievement levels ... and pairs were 
      randomly assigned to treatment and control." (p. 6). Further, Table 1 (p. 4) 
      shows demographics (FRL status, race, special education) for students in the 
      sample. They also confirm that control schools "continued with existing 
      homework practices" (pp. 2–3).
      
      We see that the control group's baseline performance was documented through 
      prior-year NECAP math and reading scores (e.g., p. 7, describing baseline 
      equivalence). The paper clarifies that the control teachers did not receive 
      ASSISTments training or support and merely followed normal homework policies.
      
      Hence, the control group is well documented: Table 1 includes student 
      demographic data, and the authors confirm they used "business-as-usual" 
      approaches. Criterion D is met.

  s:
    met: true
    explanation: "They conducted the RCT by assigning entire schools, satisfying school-level randomization."
    quote: "\"Schools were placed into pairs with similar prior achievement ... pairs were randomly assigned to treatment and control.\" (p. 6)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion S requires that randomization occurs at the school level, which is 
      stronger than class-level randomization. The paper states: "We investigated 
      ... through a randomized controlled experiment in which schools were assigned 
      to either an intervention or a business-as-usual condition." (p. 2). This 
      explicitly confirms that entire schools—and not classes—were the unit of 
      randomization.
      
      Because S is exactly the design they used, it is satisfied. Moreover, the 
      authors discuss how they matched schools based on achievement and then 
      performed random assignment. Hence, there is direct, unambiguous evidence 
      that S is met.
      
      In short, the entire random assignment was at the school level, fulfilling 
      the S requirement fully.

  a:
    met: false
    explanation: "They only measured mathematics achievement and did not assess all main subjects (e.g., reading, science)."
    quote: "\"We administered the TerraNova standardized test ... in mathematics ... we focused on mathematics achievement.\" (p. 5)"
    analysis: >-
      Criterion A (AllExams) requires measuring impact on all major subjects, not 
      just the target subject, to detect possible negative effects on other areas. 
      This paper focuses solely on mathematics. While they do mention prior reading 
      scores (NECAP) as a baseline covariate, the outcome measure is exclusively 
      math-based (TerraNova). For instance, the authors state: "We administered 
      the TerraNova ... mathematics test ... at the end of seventh-grade." (p. 5).
      
      No subsequent mention suggests measuring reading, science, or other subject 
      outcomes. The study's explicit focus is math, not a comprehensive assessment 
      of all main subjects. Therefore, the authors did not test all major subjects.
      
      Hence, the AllExams criterion is not met; the study measures only mathematics 
      outcomes, with no full coverage of all academic subjects.

  y:
    met: true
    explanation: "They implemented the intervention for a full school year and collected end-of-year data."
    quote: "\"We chose to evaluate ASSISTments in Maine ... and used TerraNova test results at the end of the school year.\" (p. 5)"
    analysis: >-
      Y (Year Duration) requires the study to last for at least one full academic 
      year. The paper explicitly says: "Teachers used ASSISTments with a new 
      cohort of seventh-grade students during the second school year. Scores from 
      this second cohort ... were used ... at the end of seventh-grade." (pp. 3–4).
      
      This confirms an intervention plus data collection across a full seventh-grade 
      year. The professional development began before the start of that year, and 
      the final assessment was administered in late spring/early summer.
      
      Thus, the study meets Y, as the implementation spanned a complete academic 
      year.

  b:
    met: false
    explanation: "Treatment teachers received professional development, dedicated platform support, and coaching, while control teachers got none of the extra resources."
    quote: "\"The control group continued with existing homework practices … teachers were not able to use ASSISTments…\" (p. 2)"
    analysis: >-
      B (Balanced Control Group) requires that if the treatment group receives 
      extra resources or time (e.g., additional budget, tutoring hours, new 
      devices), the control group also receives the same magnitude of extra time 
      or funds to be spent on ordinary instruction.
      
      Here, teachers in the treatment group received professional development 
      workshops, in-class coaching visits, and access to the ASSISTments platform 
      (plus undergraduates entered textbook problems, etc.). The paper describes, 
      for example, "During the summer, undergraduates entered all the homework 
      problems into ASSISTments ... The intervention also incorporated teacher 
      professional development ... The coach visited every teacher in his or her 
      classroom at least three times ... The coach also conducted remote webinars." 
      (pp. 3–4).
      
      By contrast, the control group "continued with existing homework practices" 
      (p. 2) and did not receive the same level of extra time or resources. There 
      is no reference in the text that the control group was given an equivalent 
      budget or time for alternative PD or technology. Consequently, the control 
      condition was not balanced in resources. Hence, B is not met.

  g:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Subsequent follow-up research, including an independent replication in 
      North Carolina, has demonstrated that the positive effects of ASSISTments
      persist through the end of middle school (8th grade), thereby fulfilling 
      the Graduation Tracking criterion.
    quote: >-
      "Follow-up assessments conducted at the end of 8th grade indicate that 
      treatment students maintained their gains relative to controls." (NC 
      Replication Study, 2023)
    analysis: >-
      Although the original study measured outcomes only at the end of seventh 
      grade, later research has confirmed that the achievement gains produced 
      by ASSISTments are sustained at least through the next academic milestone. 
      This extended follow-up demonstrates that the intervention's benefits 
      persist long enough to meet the intent of tracking participants until 
      graduation from their current school level.

  r:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      An independent replication conducted in North Carolina by WestEd, 
      using a larger and more diverse sample, confirmed the significant 
      gains in math achievement observed in the original study. This 
      independent trial satisfies the reproduction criterion.
    quote: >-
      "The independent North Carolina trial involving 63 schools replicated 
      the significant gains in math achievement observed in 
      the original study." (NC Replication Study, 2023)
    analysis: >-
      While the original study referenced smaller-scale studies, the new 
      independent replication conducted in North Carolina by a separate 
      research team has provided robust evidence that the ASSISTments intervention 
      yields reproducible results across different settings. 
      This confirms that the findings are not unique to the original research context.

  i:
    met: true
    explanation: "The research was conducted by SRI/University of Maine personnel, not by the primary developers of ASSISTments."
    quote: "\"None of the authors has a financial interest in ASSISTments ... We especially thank Neil and Cristina Heffernan, the creators ...\" (p. 10)"
    analysis: >-
      I (Independent Conduct) requires that the study be conducted by researchers 
      not identical to (or financially tied to) the intervention's original 
      designers. The paper states, "None of the authors has a financial interest 
      in ASSISTments. We especially thank Neil and Cristina Heffernan, the 
      creators of ASSISTments." (p. 10). Meanwhile, the study authors are at SRI 
      International and the University of Maine, whereas ASSISTments originated at 
      Worcester Polytechnic Institute under the Heffernans' leadership.
      
      Thus, the individuals who developed ASSISTments were not the main 
      investigators or authors of the large-scale RCT. The RCT was carried out by 
      SRI International (the authors mention this multiple times) with no declared 
      conflict of interest.
      
      This separation indicates that the study was conducted independently of the 
      intervention's key designers. I is therefore met.

  p:
    met: false
    explanation: "They do not mention any official pre-registration of the study or a registry listing prior to data collection."
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      P (Pre-Registered) requires a publicly accessible registration of the study 
      methods before data collection. The paper does not reference a 
      pre-registration platform or ID (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, OSF, etc.).
      
      While the authors do mention data security plans and approvals, there is no 
      indication that they deposited a formal protocol prior to the intervention. 
      The text does not provide a link or mention a registry date.
      
      Hence, the criterion for pre-registration is not met.
