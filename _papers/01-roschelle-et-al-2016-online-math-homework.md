abstract: >-
  This study evaluates whether an educational technology intervention increases
  mathematics learning among seventh-grade students, using an online homework 
  tool combined with teacher training to enhance formative assessment opportunities. 
  Results from a randomized field trial indicate a significant improvement in 
  student achievement, particularly for those with prior low performance.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: "Randomization was conducted at the school level, fulfilling the class-level RCT requirement."
    quote: >-
      "Schools were placed into pairs with similar prior achievement 
      levels and enrollment sizes, and pairs were randomly assigned to 
      treatment and control." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "We conducted a randomized field trial with 2,850 seventh-grade
      mathematics students." (p. 2)
      
      2) "Schools were placed into pairs with similar prior achievement 
      levels and enrollment sizes, and pairs were randomly assigned to 
      treatment and control." (p. 5)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      The study randomizes at the school level, reducing risks of bias 
      and contamination within classes. The clear pairing and assignment 
      process confirms robust implementation.

      Final sentence: The criterion is fully met.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: "A standardized test (TerraNova) was used, fulfilling the exam-based assessment criterion."
    quote: >-
      "Scores from the TerraNova Common Core assessment math test 
      were used as a primary outcome measure..." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "...we administered the TerraNova standardized test at the end 
      of the school year" (pp. 5–6)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      TerraNova is a well-established and objective exam. Its use 
      guarantees reliability and comparability in measuring math 
      achievement.

      Final sentence: The exam-based assessment criterion is met.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: "The intervention lasted for a full school year, meeting the term duration criterion."
    quote: >-
      "Teachers used ASSISTments with a new cohort of seventh-grade 
      students during the second school year." (pp. 3–4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "Teachers used ASSISTments with a new cohort of seventh-grade
      students during the second school year." (pp. 3–4)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      The intervention spans an entire school year. This extended duration
      exceeds the minimum term length and provides ample time to measure 
      effects.

      Final sentence: The term duration criterion is fully met.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: "The control group is well-documented with demographic data and baseline performance."
    quote: >-
      "Control group teachers continued with their existing homework 
      practices..." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "Control group teachers continued with their existing homework 
      practices" (p. 2)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      Demographic details and baseline performance are provided, which 
      clearly document the control group's characteristics.

      Final sentence: The documented control group criterion is met.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: "The study utilized school-level randomization, fulfilling the criterion for a school-level RCT."
    quote: >-
      "Schools were placed into pairs with similar prior achievement 
      levels and enrollment sizes, and pairs were randomly assigned to 
      treatment and control." (p. 6)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "Schools were placed into pairs with similar prior achievement 
      levels and enrollment sizes, and pairs were randomly assigned to 
      treatment and control." (p. 6)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      Randomization at the school level is the gold standard for 
      educational RCTs. It minimizes bias and captures real-world 
      implementation factors.

      Final sentence: The school-level RCT criterion is fully met.
  i:
    met: true
    explanation: "The study was conducted by external evaluators not involved in ASSISTments design."
    quote: >-
      "None of the authors has a financial interest in ASSISTments..." (p. 10)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "None of the authors has a financial interest in ASSISTments. 
      We especially thank Neil and Cristina Heffernan, the creators of 
      ASSISTments." (p. 10)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      The evaluation was performed independently from the ASSISTments 
      designers, thereby reducing potential conflicts of interest.

      Final sentence: The independent conduct criterion is met.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: "The intervention was implemented over an entire school year."
    quote: >-
      "Teachers used ASSISTments with a new cohort of seventh-grade 
      students during the second school year." (pp. 3–4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "Teachers used ASSISTments with a new cohort of seventh-grade
      students during the second school year." (pp. 3–4)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      A full academic year of implementation ensures that the effects are 
      measured over a sustained period, which meets the year duration 
      requirement.

      Final sentence: The year duration criterion is met.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: "The treatment group received additional resources that were not matched for the control group."
    quote: >-
      "The control group continued with existing homework practices..." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "During the summer, undergraduates entered all the homework problems 
      into ASSISTments... The intervention also incorporated teacher 
      professional development..." (pp. 3–4)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      The extra support, training, and resources provided solely to the 
      intervention group create an imbalance relative to the control group.

      Final sentence: The balanced resources criterion is not met.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: "No independent replication of the study was found."
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      None
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      While this study presents thorough and significant findings, there are no 
      external studies that replicate its results.

      Final sentence: The criterion is not met as no external replications were found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: "Only mathematics achievement was measured, not all main subjects."
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      None
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      The study only measures mathematics outcomes and omits other 
      core subjects, failing to assess overall academic performance.

      Final sentence: The all-subject exams criterion is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: "The study lacks evidence of tracking students until graduation."
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      None

      Detailed Analysis:
      The study did not address long-term tracking of outcomes for the student participants 
      beyond the academic year.

      Final sentence: The graduation tracking criterion is not met.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: "No evidence of pre-registration was found for the original study."
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      None
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      A search of major pre-registration platforms did not reveal any record. 
      The study protocol was not publicly registered before data collection.

      Final sentence: The pre-registered criterion is not met.
