abstract: >-
  Recent research has revealed that the substitution of handwriting practice for
  typing may hinder the initial steps of reading development. The current
  experiment investigated the impact of graphomotor action and output
  variability in letter and word learning using a variety of tasks. A total of
  50 prereaders learned nine letters and 16 pseudowords made up of these
  letters across four learning conditions: copying the letters/words by hand,
  tracing the letters/words, typing the letters/words on a computer with
  several fonts, and typing with a single font. Posttest tasks included
  naming, writing, and visual identification of the trained letters and
  words. Results showed that children in the handwriting groups achieved
  higher accuracy across all posttest tasks compared with those in the
  typing groups.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Randomization was at the individual child level, but the intervention was
      delivered one-to-one, fitting the personal teaching exception.
    quote: >-
      The training and testing were conducted individually in a classroom within
      the same educational center.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The children were randomly assigned to one of four training subgroups
      designed to examine two main comparisons: (a) handwriting versus typing and
      (b) high versus low variability." (p. 5)

      2) "The training and testing were conducted individually in a classroom
      within the same educational center." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomization at the class level (or stronger), unless
      the intervention is personal teaching where student-level randomization is
      acceptable. Here, children were randomized into four training subgroups.
      Although this is not class-level randomization, the paper states that
      training and testing were conducted individually (one-to-one delivery).
      This matches the ERCT personal teaching exception because the intervention
      is delivered individually rather than through intact classes.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met because student-level
      randomization is acceptable when the intervention is delivered one-to-one.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured with study-specific tasks on novel letters and
      pseudowords, not standardized exams.
    quote: >-
      The stimuli consisted of nine unfamiliar letters drawn from the Armenian
      and Georgian alphabets, which were novel for Spanish readers;
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The stimuli consisted of nine unfamiliar letters drawn from the
      Armenian and Georgian alphabets, which were novel for Spanish readers;"
      (p. 6)

      2) "Posttest tasks included naming, writing, and visual identification of
      the trained letters and words." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized, exam-based assessments. This study
      teaches unfamiliar letters and pseudowords, then assesses learning using
      study-specific posttest tasks (naming, writing, identification). These are
      not standardized exams.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is not met because outcomes are
      measured using custom experimental tasks rather than standardized exams.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were assessed within three consecutive days, far shorter than one
      academic term.
    quote: >-
      Each participant attended three 45-min sessions held on 3 consecutive days.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Each participant attended three 45-min sessions held on 3 consecutive
      days." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcome measurement at least one academic term after
      the intervention begins. The intervention and posttests occurred across
      three consecutive days, so the follow-up is immediate and far shorter than
      a term.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is not met because the study
      duration and measurement window are only three days.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The paper documents participant characteristics and reports no baseline
      differences across groups in control measures.
    quote: >-
      The descriptive data for the control tasks in the sample are presented in
      Table 1. No significant differences between groups were found in any of
      the control measures.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "A total of 50 children in the last year of kindergarten (mean age = 5.4
      years; 22 girls) participated in this experiment with the informed consent
      of their parents." (p. 5)

      2) "The descriptive data for the control tasks in the sample are presented
      in Table 1. No significant differences between groups were found in any of
      the control measures." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires documented baseline characteristics and comparability
      across randomized groups. The paper reports the sample size and
      demographics and explicitly states that no significant differences between
      groups were found in the control measures presented in Table 1, supporting
      baseline equivalence.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because baseline
      characteristics and between-group comparability are documented.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study sampled from a single school and randomized children, not schools.
    quote: >-
      The sample was selected from a school in an urban area of the Basque
      Country in Spain.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The sample was selected from a school in an urban area of the Basque
      Country in Spain." (p. 6)

      2) "The children were randomly assigned to one of four training subgroups"
      (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level randomization. This study sampled from a
      single school and randomized children into conditions, so schools were not
      randomized.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is not met because randomization
      was within one school rather than across schools.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent evaluation organization is described in the paper.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires an independent organization (separate from the
      intervention designers) to conduct the evaluation. The paper does not
      describe an external evaluation organization or an independent team
      conducting implementation or analysis.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is not met because independent
      conduct of the evaluation is not described.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study duration and measurement window were days, not an academic year.
    quote: >-
      Each participant attended three 45-min sessions held on 3 consecutive days.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Each participant attended three 45-min sessions held on 3 consecutive
      days." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least one academic year after
      the intervention begins. This study took place over three consecutive days
      with immediate posttests.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is not met because there is no
      year-long duration or follow-up.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The paper states that exposure and duration were made comparable across
      conditions, balancing time-on-task and practice quantity.
    quote: >-
      was maximized by ensuring that all of them involved the same exposure to
      the stimuli for a similar duration.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "was maximized by ensuring that all of them involved the same exposure
      to the stimuli for a similar duration." (p. 7)

      2) "To ensure equivalence across the different learning conditions, all
      participants produced the same number of copies of each letter and
      pronounced its sound only once per letter presentation." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B asks whether time and resources are balanced across conditions
      unless extra resources are the explicit treatment variable. The paper
      explicitly states that exposure and duration were made comparable across
      learning conditions and that participants produced the same number of
      copies per letter. This indicates time-on-task and practice quantity were
      controlled across groups.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met because the study
      explicitly matched exposure and practice quantity across all groups.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent peer-reviewed replication of this specific experiment was
      found.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication by other authors. A web
      search did not identify a peer-reviewed study that explicitly reproduces
      this specific experiment, and the paper does not report being replicated.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is not met because no independent
      peer-reviewed replication was found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      This criterion is not met because Criterion E is not met and outcomes are
      not standardized exams across subjects.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A cannot be met if Criterion E is not met. This study also
      focuses on letter and word learning rather than standardized tests across
      multiple subjects.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because Criterion E is
      not met and outcomes are not standardized exams.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not track participants to graduation, and the one-year
      prerequisite is not met.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Each participant attended three 45-min sessions held on 3 consecutive
      days." (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G cannot be met if Criterion Y is not met. The study is short-
      term with no longitudinal tracking. A web search did not find follow-up
      papers by the same authors tracking this cohort until graduation.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is not met because there is no
      long-term tracking and the one-year prerequisite is not met.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper provides an OSF link for materials and data but does not state or
      verify preregistration with a pre-data-collection date.
    quote: >-
      All stimuli, data, analysis scripts, and outputs are available on the Open
      Science Framework (OSF) (https://osf.io/m2jh8/?view_only=
      954f06d3352a48d5ab41514e75aecac2 ).
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "All stimuli, data, analysis scripts, and outputs are available on the
      Open Science Framework (OSF) (https://osf.io/m2jh8/?view_only=954f06d3352a48d5ab41514e75aecac2 )."
      (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires a preregistered protocol with a registration date
      before data collection begins. The paper provides an OSF link for
      materials and data but does not state that the study was preregistered,
      and it does not provide a preregistration identifier or date. The OSF page
      does not appear to be a preregistration record based on the citation in
      the paper.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is not met because preregistration
      is not explicitly stated and a preregistration record and date are not
      provided.
