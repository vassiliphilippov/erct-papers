  This study compares a traditional handout versus an augmented reality (AR)
  video approach to teaching threading and knitting concepts in textile-related
  courses. The authors randomly split students into two groups (handout vs. AR
  video) and measured learning outcomes via short tests, threading performance,
  time-on-task, and questionnaire responses. Results suggest that AR-based
  instruction increases students’ understanding of complex 3D processes and
  reduces the time required to learn certain tasks. The paper describes the
  randomized assignment, the educational context, test details, and data analysis
  of pre- and post-tests, concluding that AR video use is a promising
  instructional tool for textile and clothing students.

criteria:
  c:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Randomization likely occurred at the student level within classes or sessions, not at the class level.
    quote: >
      "To randomly allocate the study participants into the two groups, all students
      were randomly allocated into different Intimate Textiles and Accessories classes
      by the PolyU computer system..." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To reduce selection bias and obtain more accurate results, a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) was run. Study participants were randomly allocated to
      two different groups..." (p. 6)

      2) "To randomly allocate the study participants into the two groups, all students
      were randomly allocated into different Intimate Textiles and Accessories classes
      by the PolyU computer system, which randomly selected the tutorial class
      designated Group A (received handouts) or Group B (viewed AR videos)." (p. 7)

      3) "To avoid bias and ensure the accuracy of this study, the students were
      randomly allocated into groups. Those who enrolled in Sessions 2, 3 or 5 were
      placed into Group A, whereas students who signed up for Sessions 1, 4 or 6 were
      placed into Group B." (p. 9)

      4) "During the trial, both groups of students were allowed to answer the
      questions with their learning tool (handout or AR video)..." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT 'C' criterion requires class-level randomization to prevent
      contamination. Quote 2 suggests the PolyU system allocated students into classes
      designated as Group A or B, which could imply class-level assignment. However,
      Quote 1 emphasizes individual allocation to groups, and Quote 3 (threading task)
      ties randomization to session enrollment, not necessarily intact classes. Quote 4
      indicates both groups used their tools in the same testing environment, suggesting
      no strict separation. An alternative view posits that "different classes" means
      entire tutorial classes were randomized, but the lack of explicit confirmation
      (e.g., "each class was assigned one condition") and evidence of mixed settings
      (Quote 4) weaken this. Without clear evidence of class-unit randomization and
      separation, contamination remains a risk.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is not met because randomization appears to be at the
      student or subgroup level within classes or sessions, not definitively at the
      class level.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They used custom-created quizzes and performance metrics instead of any
      external standardized exam.
    quote: >-
      “A simple test on three main types of knitting needles… The test comprised
      two sections… a score of 16 was given… The students were required to thread
      a flat sewing machine… the time required for each student to finish the
      task was recorded.” (Sections 2.3–2.4)
    analysis: >-
      The criterion requires the use of a well-known standardized exam. Instead,
      the paper describes custom-made tests designed to assess threading and
      knitting skills. There is no mention of an externally validated assessment,
      so the exam-based assessment criterion is not met.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study took place over brief sessions in September rather than covering a
      full academic term of at least several months.
    quote: >-
      “A simple test on… was given on 15 September 2017… The threading task in
      sewing workshops… from 26 to 29 September 2017.” (Sections 2.3–2.4)
    analysis: >-
      The intervention was implemented in a very short timeframe, spanning only a
      few sessions in September. This duration does not meet the requirement of a
      full academic term.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They provide basic demographic info, pre- and post-test scores, and clearly
      note that the control group used only a handout with no AR resources.
    quote: >-
      “...46 freshmen… 27 were placed in Group A (handouts), 19 in Group B (AR
      videos). All participants were… 4 males and 42 females… a pre-test was
      carried out before the students received the handout or downloaded the AR
      videos…” (Sections 2.4.1–2.4.2)
    analysis: >-
      The study documents the control group by reporting group sizes, demographic
      details, and baseline test results. It distinguishes between the handout and
      AR video groups, satisfying the requirement for a documented control group.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They randomized classes within one university department, not entire schools.
    quote: >-
      No quotes indicate multi-school assignment; they mention only that students
      were randomly allocated into tutorial classes.
    analysis: >-
      While the study uses cluster randomization at the tutorial-class level, it
      does not extend to school-level randomization, which is required for Criterion
      S.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They evaluated only sewing/knitting performance and knowledge, with no
      mention of measuring every main subject area via standardized exams.
    quote: >-
      “...the study focused on the evaluation of an AR application in education…
      the innovation… particularly for learning a complicated task/concept, i.e.,
      threading.” (Section 5)
    analysis: >-
      The study focuses solely on skills related to threading and knitting without
      assessing broader academic subjects. Therefore, the AllExams criterion is not met.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The entire intervention and data collection took place over a short timeframe,
      not spanning a full academic year.
    quote: >-
      “A simple test… 15 September… Another trial… 26 to 29 September… The time
      required for each student… was recorded.” (Sections 2.3–2.4)
    analysis: >-
      The intervention was limited to a brief period in September, which is far less
      than the duration of an academic year, so Criterion Y is not satisfied.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention group had AR technology, but the control group only had a
      handout and no equivalently increased resources or budget.
    quote: >-
      “Group A (handout)… Group B (AR video)… no mention of matching resources or
      budget for the control group.” (Sections 2.4.2–2.4.3)
    analysis: >-
      The study did not provide the control group with an equivalent resource to
      balance the additional technology provided to the AR group. This imbalance
      fails to meet the Balanced Control Group criterion.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They gathered only short-term data from immediate post-tests, with no extended
      tracking through graduation.
    quote: >-
      “Another trial on basic terminology and understanding… The results obtained
      in the simple test… were then assessed… [no mention of following them to
      graduation].” (Sections 2.3–2.4)
    analysis: >-
      The study only measures immediate outcomes following the intervention and
      does not track long-term progress or graduation, failing the Graduation
      Tracking criterion.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication is reported or cited; they only describe their
      single study in one institution.
    quote: >-
      The paper does not mention any separate or replicated study by another
      research team.
    analysis: >-
      There is no evidence of an independent replication of the study. The results
      are based solely on a single study conducted at one institution, so Criterion R
      is not met.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The same group that designed the AR app also conducted the research, with no
      independent evaluation team.
    quote: >-
      “A mobile application (app) called ITC VR AR was developed by the Institute
      of Textiles and Clothing… The aim… to determine whether AR videos can improve
      teaching.” (Sections 2.2, 2.5)
    analysis: >-
      Since the authors were involved in both the development of the AR app and the
      research, there is a conflict of interest that prevents the study from being
      considered independently conducted.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They did not mention registering their protocol before data collection; no
      public registry link or ID is cited.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      The study lacks any reference to a pre-registration of its methods or analysis,
      meaning the Pre-Registered criterion is not met.
