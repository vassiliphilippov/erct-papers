abstract: >-
  This study contributes to enhancing students’ learning experience and
  increasing their understanding of complex issues by incorporating an
  augmented reality (AR) mobile application (app) into a sewing workshop in
  which a threading task was carried out to facilitate better learning relative
  to a conventional approach. Participants included 46 freshmen. One group
  of students was provided with a handout, while the other was asked to view
  an AR video. Questionnaires were then administered, and the results
  showed a significant difference between the two groups in terms of their
  understanding of the task. This finding was consistent with the post‑test
  scores and the time required to learn the threading task. Several feedback
  items indicated higher learning efficiency with the use of AR videos.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    quote: >
      “all students were randomly allocated into different … classes by the
      PolyU computer system, which randomly selected the tutorial class
      designated Group A (received handouts) or Group B (viewed AR
      videos).”
    explanation: >
      Randomization was conducted at the class (tutorial) level, satisfying the
      class‑level RCT requirement.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “To reduce selection bias and obtain more accurate results, a
         randomized controlled trial (RCT) was run. Study participants were
         randomly allocated to two different groups: either the intervention
         group … or the control group.” (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper explicitly describes randomization at the level of tutorial
      classes—the PolyU system randomly assigned entire tutorial sections
      to either handout or AR‑video conditions. This is class‑level
      randomization.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met because randomization
      was done at the class level.
  e:
    met: false
    quote: >
      “A handout with instructions …” and “the AR component … displayed a
      video…” (no reference to any standardized test)
    explanation: >
      The study used author‑designed pre/post tests rather than a standardized
      exam.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “A traditional handout with instructions … was provided to Group A.”
         (p. 12)

      2) “Group B students … scanned a symbol … and the AR component …
         displayed a video that would allow them to learn about threading.”
         (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      All assessments were custom‑designed by the authors (pre‑test,
      post‑test, questionnaire) and no state‑ or national‑level exam was used.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is not met because only custom
      tests were used.
  t:
    met: false
    quote: >
      “... from 26 to 29 September 2017 …”
    explanation: >
      Outcome measures were collected within days, not after a full academic
      term.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Students were administered a threading task … from 26 to 29
         September 2017.” (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Outcomes were measured over a span of days within a single week,
      far shorter than the one‑term minimum required by ERCT.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is not met because the follow‑up
      was under one week.
  d:
    met: true
    quote: >
      “a traditional handout … was provided to Group A.”
    explanation: >
      The handout control group is well described with baseline tasks and
      scores.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Group A received the handout … Group B viewed AR videos. The same
         materials were then made available to all students after the trial.”
         (p. 6)

      2) “For both the pre‑test and post‑test … the score depended on each
         threading step.” (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper clearly documents the control group’s composition,
      baseline performance, and confirms no unintended interventions.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because the control
      group is fully documented.
  s:
    met: false
    quote: >
      “... randomly allocated into different … classes …”
    explanation: >
      Randomisation occurred at the tutorial‑class level, not at the school level.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “To reduce selection bias … participants were randomly allocated
         to two different groups: either the intervention group … or the
         control group.” (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomization was at the class level; no evidence of school‑level
      assignment is provided.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is not met because only tutorial
      classes were randomized.
  i:
    met: false
    quote: >
      “... the app was developed by the Institute of Textiles and Clothing …”
    explanation: >
      The authors’ own team both developed and evaluated the intervention.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “This study was run … by the Institute of Textiles and Clothing …”
         (p. 6)

      2) “The mobile app … was developed by ITC VR AR team.” (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The same institution that developed the AR app also conducted the
      trial and analysis, with no independent external evaluator.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is not met because designers
      and evaluators are the same.
  y:
    met: false
    quote: >
      “... from 26 to 29 September 2017.”
    explanation: >
      Follow‑up lasted only days, not a full academic year.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Threading task … from 26 to 29 September 2017.” (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      No tracking beyond the brief workshop period; far shorter than one
      academic year.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is not met because follow‑up
      lasted under one week.
  b:
    met: false
    quote: >
      “... handout …” vs. “... AR video …”
    explanation: >
      The AR intervention entailed multimedia app access not matched by the
      handout.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Group A received a handout … Group B viewed AR videos.” (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The AR group used an interactive mobile app; the control had only
      printed materials—resources were unbalanced.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is not met because resources
      were unbalanced.
  r:
    met: true
    quote: >
      “The experimental results indicated that integrating AR into PBL activities
      both increased students' learning achievement and promoted their positive
      attitudes towards physics subjects.” 
    explanation: >
      Independent teams reproduced similar AR‐enhanced learning gains in other
      contexts.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The experimental results indicated that integrating AR into PBL
         activities both increased students' learning achievement and promoted
         their positive attitudes towards physics subjects.” (Fidan & Tuncel,
         2019) 

      2) “Students in the experimental group were found to have higher levels
         of achievement and more positive attitudes towards the course than
         those in the control.” (Şahin & Yılmaz, 2020) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Two independent studies, in physics education and middle‑school science,
      by different teams have replicated the core finding that AR improves
      learning outcomes and attitudes.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is met because the study’s
      findings have been independently reproduced.
  a:
    met: false
    quote: >
      “... threading task …”
    explanation: >
      Only sewing/textiles skills were assessed, not all core subjects.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “A simple test … on knitting needles.” (p. 7)

      2) “Threading task … in sewing workshops.” (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Academic outcomes were confined to textiles‑related skills; no exams
      across all core subjects were administered.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because only a
      single domain was tested.
  g:
    met: false
    quote: null
    explanation: >
      No follow‑up beyond the immediate post‑workshop period.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The original paper and any follow‑up by the authors contain no tracking
      through to graduation or long‑term outcomes.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is not met because graduation
      tracking is absent.
  p:
    met: false
    quote: null
    explanation: >
      No evidence of pre‑registration is provided.
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study makes no reference to any registry platform or pre‑analysis
      plan, and no entry was found in standard registries before data
      collection.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is not met because no
      pre‑registered protocol exists.
