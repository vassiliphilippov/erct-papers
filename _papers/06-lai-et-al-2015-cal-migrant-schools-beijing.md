abstract: >-
  Using a randomized field experiment in 43 migrant schools in Beijing, this paper
  examines the impact of a computer-assisted learning (CAL) program on math
  performance and other outcomes of third-grade students from disadvantaged
  migrant families. One class per school was randomly assigned to receive two
  40-minute weekly CAL sessions for one semester. Students in the CAL group
  scored 0.15 standard deviations higher in math than control classmates and
  reported improved attitudes toward school. The study concludes that a remedial
  CAL program outside regular school hours can benefit low-performing students,
  but does not address whether all standard school subjects are covered, nor does
  it employ an officially recognized standardized exam. It also does not track
  students until graduation or feature a pre-registered protocol. Consequently,
  it partially meets some ERCT criteria but not at the full Level 1 threshold or
  beyond.

  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They clearly assigned entire third-grade classes (not individual students)
      to receive the CAL intervention, fulfilling class-level randomization.
    quote: >-
      "Within each school, one class was randomly selected to receive the CAL
      intervention." (p. 37)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “Within each school, one class was randomly selected to receive the
           CAL intervention, leaving the other classes in each school to serve as the
           control group.” (p. 37)
         - “Our research team randomly selected one third grade class in each of the
           24 program schools to receive the CAL intervention (the treatment group),
           leaving the rest of the third grade classes in each school as the control
           group.” (p. 37)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         The paper describes a clear randomization procedure at the class level within
         each school. In each migrant school with at least two third-grade classes, the
         authors randomly picked one class for the CAL program while the remaining
         classes served as controls. This design minimizes contamination by assigning
         whole classes rather than individual students. There is no mention of any
         tutoring exceptions, so the procedure meets the class-level RCT requirement.

    explanation: >-
      They used a custom-made (or partly customized) assessment instead of a widely
      recognized standardized exam.
    quote: >-
      "The math test included 29–32 questions … chosen from official examination
      books … The Chinese test included 30–35 questions." (p. 36)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “Some experts from the Center for Examination of Beijing helped us pick
           questions for the tests from official examination books and exercise books.
           The math test included 29–32 questions … The Chinese test included 30–35
           questions.” (p. 36)
         - “We used the scores of the students on the math and Chinese tests as our
           measures of student academic performance.” (p. 36)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         Criterion E requires using an externally validated, widely recognized exam.
         Although the tests were assembled with external input, they were not a formal
         standardized exam. Instead, the instruments were custom-designed for this
         study, so the criterion is not met.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The program ran for the full fall semester (about 4 months), satisfying the
      requirement of covering at least one academic term.
    quote: >-
      "The CAL program … ran from early September to late December 2010, spanning the
      Fall 2010 semester." (pp. 37–38)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “The main intervention … was a math CAL remedial tutoring program that was
           held outside of regular school hours for the Fall 2010 semester. … In total,
           two 40-min CAL sessions per week from early September to late December.”
           (pp. 37–38)
         - “Our results show that a remedial CAL program held out of regular school
           hours improved math scores by 0.15 standard deviations … The program effect
           took place within 2 months after the start.” (p. 34)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         The intervention took place during the Fall 2010 semester, which typically
         lasts 3.5 to 4 months in Chinese elementary schools. This duration exceeds the
         minimum term requirement, thereby meeting the T criterion.

      They detail the control group’s composition, baseline test scores, and
      demographics, and confirm it received no CAL sessions or extra input.
    quote: >-
      "...leaving the other classes as control group(s). We collected data on baseline
      test scores, demographics, and family characteristics for all students...” (p. 37)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “Within each sample school, we randomly chose one class to be in the
           treatment group, leaving the rest as control. … We collected data on baseline
           test scores, demographics (e.g., gender, age), and family characteristics for
           all students in both groups.” (p. 37)
         - “In each round of survey … enumerators collected data on the characteristics
           of students and their families … The dataset includes measures of each
           student’s age, father’s education level, and mother’s education level.”
           (pp. 38–39)
         - “We also observed a group of pure control schools that were never informed of
           the CAL program … to disentangle potential spillovers.” (p. 38)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         The study provides extensive baseline data and clearly documents that the
         control groups received no additional CAL intervention, thus fulfilling the
         requirements of Criterion D.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They randomized classes within schools, not entire schools, so they did not meet
      the school-level RCT requirement.
    quote: >-
      "...one class was randomly selected to receive the CAL intervention, leaving the
      other classes in the same school as control." (p. 37)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “Within each school, one class was randomly selected to receive the CAL
           intervention, leaving the other classes to serve as the control group.”
           (p. 37)
         - “Of the 43 migrant schools in our sample frame, we randomly chose 24 schools
           as sample schools, but the randomization of the intervention occurred at the
           class level.” (pp. 36–37)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         Although multiple schools were involved, the randomization was conducted
         at the classroom level within each school rather than at the school level.
         This does not satisfy the stronger school-level RCT criterion (S).
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They only measured math (and checked Chinese for spillovers); no other 
      core subjects were tested, so the ‘AllExams’ criterion is not fulfilled.
    quote: >-
      "The CAL program was focused on math performance… We also observed 
      standardized Chinese test scores to check for any spillover." (p. 39)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “The CAL program was focused on math performance. … The main outcome 
           measure is the standardized math score.” (p. 39) 
         - “We also observed standardized Chinese test scores to check for any 
           spillover.” (p. 39)
      2) Detailed Analysis:
         Criterion A requires that all major subjects be assessed via standardized exams. 
         In this study, math was the only subject targeted by the intervention (with 
         Chinese tested only to see if any effect carried over). No exams in other 
         subjects (like science) were administered, so the AllExams requirement is not met.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The CAL experiment lasted one semester (roughly four months), not a full
      academic year.
    quote: >-
      "Two 40-min CAL sessions per week from early September to late December."
      (p. 37)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “Our main intervention ran from early September to late December 2010,
           covering the Fall 2010 semester.” (p. 37)
         - “Thus, about four months total, from the beginning of the semester until it
           ended.” (p. 38)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         Criterion Y demands an intervention over a full academic year. As the study
         only spans one semester, it fails to meet this requirement.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      CAL students received extra resources (computers, software, a paid supervisor), 
      whereas control students received no equivalent support.
    quote: >-
      "Students in the classes assigned to the control group did not receive any 
      CAL intervention. Following the protocol, they were not allowed to access 
      the computers..." (p. 39)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “During each session, students in the treatment group worked in pairs on 
           computers … The teacher–supervisor was compensated 400 yuan per month … 
           and we provided all computers.” (pp. 38, 44)
         - “Students in the classes that were assigned to the control group … did not 
           receive any CAL intervention. Following the protocol, they were not allowed 
           to access the computers….” (p. 39)
      2) Detailed Analysis:
         The treatment group was given access to computers, specialized math software, 
         and a trained supervisor (with financial compensation) – resources not available 
         to the control group. Control classes simply continued 
         regular instruction with no additional inputs beyond the usual, meaning the two 
         groups were not provided balanced resources. This violates Criterion B.

    explanation: >-
      They only tracked outcomes within one semester; no long-term or graduation
      follow-up was conducted.
    quote: >-
      "Our results show that a remedial CAL program held out of regular school hours
      improved the student standardized math scores by 0.15 s.d.… we only conducted
      midterm and final evaluations in that same semester." (pp. 34, 36)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “We only examine short-term outcomes: midterm in November 2010 and final
           evaluation in December 2010.” (p. 36)
         - “No mention of tracking through graduation or follow-up beyond the single
           semester.” (throughout the paper)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         The study’s outcome measurement ends with the fall semester, so it does not
         track students until graduation.

    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No evidence is provided that an external research team replicated this 
      CAL intervention in a different context.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Discussion:
         - The study reports one randomized experiment in migrant schools in Beijing. 
           It does not reference any subsequent implementation of the same program by 
           another independent team.
      2) Detailed Analysis:
         Criterion R requires that the findings be reproduced by an independent study. 
         This paper makes no mention of any follow-up study or replication carried out 
         by different researchers. Absent an independent replication, we must conclude 
         that this criterion is not met.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention and evaluation were conducted by the same research team; 
      there was no independent external evaluator.
    quote: >-
      "The research group conducted a total of three rounds of a survey of each 
      third-grade student in the 24 schools..." (p. 40)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “We conducted a clustered (at the class level) RCT of CAL in Beijing migrant 
           schools…” (p. 36)
         - “The research group conducted a total of three rounds of a survey of each 
           third-grade student in the 24 schools in our main sample…” (p. 40)
      2) Detailed Analysis:
         The authors themselves designed and implemented the CAL program and also carried 
         out the randomization and data collection&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}. There is no 
         indication that any independent agency was hired to run the experiment or evaluate 
         outcomes. Because the same team was responsible for both the intervention delivery 
         and its evaluation, the study fails to meet the independence criterion (I).

    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No statement or link indicates an official pre-registration prior to data
      collection.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “We do not see any mention of a pre-registration on a registry platform
           (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, OSF).” (entire text)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         The absence of any pre-registration or publicly documented protocol means the
         study does not meet the pre-registration requirement.
