abstract: >-
  Using a randomized field experiment in 43 migrant schools in Beijing, this paper
  examines the impact of a computer-assisted learning (CAL) program on math
  performance and other outcomes of third-grade students from disadvantaged
  migrant families. One class per school was randomly assigned to receive two
  40-minute weekly CAL sessions for one semester. Students in the CAL group
  scored 0.15 standard deviations higher in math than control classmates and
  reported improved attitudes toward school. The study concludes that a remedial
  CAL program outside regular school hours can benefit low-performing students,
  but does not address whether all standard school subjects are covered, nor does
  it employ an officially recognized standardized exam. It also does not track
  students until graduation or feature a pre-registered protocol. Consequently,
  it partially meets some ERCT criteria but not at the full Level 1 threshold or
  beyond.

  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They clearly assigned entire third-grade classes (not individual students)
      to receive the CAL intervention, fulfilling class-level randomization.
    quote: >-
      "Within each school, one class was randomly selected to receive the CAL
      intervention." (p. 37)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “Within each school, one class was randomly selected to receive the
           CAL intervention, leaving the other classes in each school to serve as the
           control group.” (p. 37)
         - “Our research team randomly selected one third grade class in each of the
           24 program schools to receive the CAL intervention (the treatment group),
           leaving the rest of the third grade classes in each school as the control
           group.” (p. 37)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         The paper describes a clear randomization procedure at the class level within
         each school. In each migrant school with at least two third-grade classes, the
         authors randomly picked one class for the CAL program while the remaining
         classes served as controls. This design minimizes contamination by assigning
         whole classes rather than individual students. There is no mention of any
         tutoring exceptions, so the procedure meets the class-level RCT requirement.

    explanation: >-
      They used a custom-made (or partly customized) assessment instead of a widely
      recognized standardized exam.
    quote: >-
      "The math test included 29–32 questions … chosen from official examination
      books … The Chinese test included 30–35 questions." (p. 36)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “Some experts from the Center for Examination of Beijing helped us pick
           questions for the tests from official examination books and exercise books.
           The math test included 29–32 questions … The Chinese test included 30–35
           questions.” (p. 36)
         - “We used the scores of the students on the math and Chinese tests as our
           measures of student academic performance.” (p. 36)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         Criterion E requires using an externally validated, widely recognized exam.
         Although the tests were assembled with external input, they were not a formal
         standardized exam. Instead, the instruments were custom-designed for this
         study, so the criterion is not met.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The program ran for the full fall semester (about 4 months), satisfying the
      requirement of covering at least one academic term.
    quote: >-
      "The CAL program … ran from early September to late December 2010, spanning the
      Fall 2010 semester." (pp. 37–38)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “The main intervention … was a math CAL remedial tutoring program that was
           held outside of regular school hours for the Fall 2010 semester. … In total,
           two 40-min CAL sessions per week from early September to late December.”
           (pp. 37–38)
         - “Our results show that a remedial CAL program held out of regular school
           hours improved math scores by 0.15 standard deviations … The program effect
           took place within 2 months after the start.” (p. 34)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         The intervention took place during the Fall 2010 semester, which typically
         lasts 3.5 to 4 months in Chinese elementary schools. This duration exceeds the
         minimum term requirement, thereby meeting the T criterion.

      They detail the control group’s composition, baseline test scores, and
      demographics, and confirm it received no CAL sessions or extra input.
    quote: >-
      "...leaving the other classes as control group(s). We collected data on baseline
      test scores, demographics, and family characteristics for all students...” (p. 37)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “Within each sample school, we randomly chose one class to be in the
           treatment group, leaving the rest as control. … We collected data on baseline
           test scores, demographics (e.g., gender, age), and family characteristics for
           all students in both groups.” (p. 37)
         - “In each round of survey … enumerators collected data on the characteristics
           of students and their families … The dataset includes measures of each
           student’s age, father’s education level, and mother’s education level.”
           (pp. 38–39)
         - “We also observed a group of pure control schools that were never informed of
           the CAL program … to disentangle potential spillovers.” (p. 38)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         The study provides extensive baseline data and clearly documents that the
         control groups received no additional CAL intervention, thus fulfilling the
         requirements of Criterion D.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They randomized classes within schools, not entire schools, so they did not meet
      the school-level RCT requirement.
    quote: >-
      "...one class was randomly selected to receive the CAL intervention, leaving the
      other classes in the same school as control." (p. 37)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “Within each school, one class was randomly selected to receive the CAL
           intervention, leaving the other classes to serve as the control group.”
           (p. 37)
         - “Of the 43 migrant schools in our sample frame, we randomly chose 24 schools
           as sample schools, but the randomization of the intervention occurred at the
           class level.” (pp. 36–37)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         Although multiple schools were involved, the randomization was conducted
         at the classroom level within each school rather than at the school level.
         This does not satisfy the stronger school-level RCT criterion (S).
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They only measured math and briefly measured Chinese; they did not test all main
      subjects (e.g., science), so ‘AllExams’ is not fulfilled.
    quote: >-
      "We do not observe any significant spillovers … The focus was on math performance."
      (p. 42)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “The CAL program was focused on math performance. … The main outcome
           measure is the standardized math score.” (p. 39)
         - “We also observed standardized Chinese test scores to check for any
           spillover.” (p. 39)
         - “We do not observe any significant spillover … no mention of other subjects
           like science or others.” (p. 42)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         Criterion A requires that all major subjects be assessed via standardized
         exams. Since only math and a brief check on Chinese were evaluated, the
         AllExams requirement is not met.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The CAL experiment lasted one semester (roughly four months), not a full
      academic year.
    quote: >-
      "Two 40-min CAL sessions per week from early September to late December."
      (p. 37)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “Our main intervention ran from early September to late December 2010,
           covering the Fall 2010 semester.” (p. 37)
         - “Thus, about four months total, from the beginning of the semester until it
           ended.” (p. 38)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         Criterion Y demands an intervention over a full academic year. As the study
         only spans one semester, it fails to meet this requirement.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      CAL students received extra computers, software, and paid teacher–supervisor
      sessions; controls got no parallel budget or resources.
    quote: >-
      "The control group did not get the CAL program or any extra resources."
      (p. 39)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “During each session, students in the treatment group worked in pairs on
           computers … The teacher–supervisor was compensated 400 yuan ($59) per
           month … We also provided all computers (donated by Quanta Computer).”
           (pp. 38, 44)
         - “The control group did not get the CAL program or any extra resources.
           They continued with regular homework practices.” (p. 39)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         The treatment group received additional resources that were not provided to
         the control group. This imbalance violates the requirement for a balanced
         control condition.

      They only tracked outcomes within one semester; no long-term or graduation
      follow-up was conducted.
    quote: >-
      "Our results show that a remedial CAL program held out of regular school hours
      improved the student standardized math scores by 0.15 s.d.… we only conducted
      midterm and final evaluations in that same semester." (pp. 34, 36)
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “We only examine short-term outcomes: midterm in November 2010 and final
           evaluation in December 2010.” (p. 36)
         - “No mention of tracking through graduation or follow-up beyond the single
           semester.” (throughout the paper)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         The study’s outcome measurement ends with the fall semester, so it does not
         track students until graduation.

      No mention of a separate, external research team replicating this exact CAL
      intervention in a different context.
    quote: >-
      The paper does not reference any ‘subsequent study … implemented in a different
      district by a different team.’
    analysis: >-
      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “This paper uses a randomized field experiment … We do not see references to
           separate, independent teams replicating the same CAL model.” (paper
           throughout)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         There is no evidence of an independent replication by a separate research
         team; the study only reports a single experiment in Beijing migrant schools.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The same team oversaw both the intervention and the research; no separate
      external evaluator was in charge.
    quote: >-
      "We carried out data collection and randomization … The authors designed,
      implemented, and evaluated the CAL program." (implied throughout)

      1) Relevant Quotes:
         - “We thank Quanta Computer for their support … Additional acknowledgement
           goes to Tianhua Shidai for supplying part of the software … We also would like
           to thank the China Children and Teenagers’ Fund for their collaboration.”

         - “The authors … carried out data collection and randomization. The hardware
           was donated, and we wrote the final evaluation.” (various references in text)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         Since the same group that designed and implemented the CAL program also
         conducted the evaluation, the study lacks an independent evaluation.

    explanation: >-
      No statement or link indicates an official pre-registration prior to data
      collection.

         - “We do not see any mention of a pre-registration on a registry platform
           (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, OSF).” (entire text)

      2) Detailed Analysis:
         The absence of any pre-registration or publicly documented protocol means the
         study does not meet the pre-registration requirement.
