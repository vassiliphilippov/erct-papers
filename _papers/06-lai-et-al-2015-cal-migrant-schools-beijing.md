abstract: >-
  The education of the disadvantaged population has been a long-standing
  challenge to education systems in both developed and developing countries.
  Although computer-assisted learning (CAL) has been considered one
  alternative to improve learning outcomes in a cost-effective way, the
  empirical evidence of its impacts on improving learning outcomes is mixed.
  This paper uses a randomized field experiment to explore the effects of
  CAL on student academic and non-academic outcomes for students in
  migrant schools in Beijing. Our results show that a remedial CAL program
  held out of regular school hours improved the student standardized math
  scores by 0.15 standard deviations and most of the program effect took
  place within 2 months after the start of the program. Students with
  less-educated parents benefited more from the program. Moreover, CAL
  also significantly increased the students’ interest in learning.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The study randomized whole classes within schools, satisfying the
      class‑level RCT requirement.
    quote: >-
      “We conducted a clustered (at the class level) RCT of CAL in Beijing
      migrant schools in the fall semester of 2010.” (p. 3)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “We conducted a clustered (at the class level) RCT of CAL in Beijing
      migrant schools in the fall semester of 2010.” (p. 3)

      2) “Within each school, one class was randomly selected to receive the
      CAL intervention, leaving the other class (classes) as control group(s).”
      (Fig. 1, p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The design randomises entire classes within each school, fulfilling the
      ERCT standard’s requirement that the unit of randomisation be the
      class (or stronger).

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met because class‑level
      randomisation was implemented.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The tests were custom assemblies of items from exam books, not formal
      standardized exams.
    quote: >-
      “Some experts from the Center for Examination of Beijing helped us pick
      questions for the tests… The math test included 29–32 questions …
      The Chinese test included 30–35 questions.” (p. 36)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Some experts from the Center for Examination of Beijing helped us
      pick questions for the tests from official examination books and exercise
      books. The math test included 29–32 questions… The Chinese test included
      30–35 questions.” (p. 36)

      2) “We used the scores of the students on the math and Chinese tests as
      our measures of student academic performance.” (p. 36)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires a formal, widely recognized standardized exam.
      Though experts contributed items, the assessments were custom-made
      and not an official standard exam.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because the tests were custom
      instruments.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Student performance was assessed at the end of the fall semester,
      meeting the term‑duration requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “We conducted a clustered (at the class level) RCT of CAL in Beijing
      migrant schools in the fall semester of 2010.” (p. 3)

      2) “The third-round survey was a final evaluation survey conducted at
      the end of the program in late December, a time that coincided with the
      end of the Fall semester.” (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention and measurement span a full academic term (the Fall
      semester), ensuring outcomes are collected at least one term after the
      start.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met because outcomes were
      measured after a full term.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The control classes’ makeup, treatment conditions, and baseline data are
      clearly reported.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Students in the classes that were assigned to the control group did
      not receive any CAL intervention… Following the protocol, they were
      not allowed to access the computers.” (p. 4)

      2) Baseline and follow‑up data, including class sizes, demographics and
      attrition rates for control classes, are fully tabulated (Tables 1–2).

      Detailed Analysis:

      The control classes are described in detail: their treatment status,
      sample size, baseline characteristics, and attrition. This allows clear
      comparisons.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because the control
      group is comprehensively documented.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The trial randomised classes within schools rather than entire schools.

      migrant schools in the fall semester of 2010.” (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomisation was limited to classes within schools. No random
      assignment occurred at the school level.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is not met because only
      class‑level randomisation occurred.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The authors who developed the CAL were also responsible for its
      implementation and assessment.

      research group, the students in the treatment group had two 40-min CAL
      sessions per week…” (p. 4)

      2) “Our research team randomly selected one third grade class in each
      of the 24 program schools to receive the CAL intervention…” (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The same team designed, implemented, and evaluated the intervention,
      with no independent third‑party evaluator noted.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is not met because conduct
      was not independent.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Tracking ceased at the semester’s end, not over a full academic year.

      2) “The third-round survey was a final evaluation survey conducted at
      the end of the program in late December…” (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Outcomes are tracked only through a single semester; no year‑long
      follow‑up is reported.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is not met because duration
      was less than one academic year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The additional CAL sessions are the treatment itself, so the control
      group’s business‑as‑usual status is appropriate.
    quote: >-
      “Under the supervision of one teacher–supervisor… the students… had two
      40-min CAL sessions per week…” (p. 4)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Under the supervision of one teacher–supervisor trained by our
      research group, the students in the treatment group had two 40-min CAL
      sessions per week during lunch break or after school…” (p. 4)

      2) “Students in the classes that were assigned to the control group did
      not receive any CAL intervention. Following the protocol, they were not
      allowed to access the computers.” (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention’s extra instructional time via CAL is the primary
      treatment variable. The control group receives business-as-usual,
      consistent with the study’s intent to test the effect of those additional
      CAL resources.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met because extra resources
      are integral to the tested intervention.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The paper contains no mention of independent replication by a different
      research team.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Papers:

      No independent replication of this trial is reported in peer‑reviewed
      journals by external teams.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The authors do not cite any studies where different researchers
      reproduced this exact experiment in another setting.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is not met because no
      replication is reported.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study assessed only math and Chinese; other core subjects were
      omitted.

      test and a standardized Chinese test.” (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Only two subjects (math and Chinese) were tested. Core areas like
      science or social studies were not assessed.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because not all
      main subjects were evaluated.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Student outcomes were not monitored beyond the semester, so no
      graduation tracking occurred.
