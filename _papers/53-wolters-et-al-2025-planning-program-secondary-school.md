abstract: >-
  In secondary education, many students have difficulties planning their
  schoolwork. These difficulties may not only lead to short-term
  consequences such as lower grades, but also to long-term psychosocial,
  professional and financial challenges. To support students with
  planning problems, we developed a school-based program (Planning of
  Schoolwork (PLOS)) using an iterative development approach. PLOS
  includes two phases: PLOS-basic, a six-lesson preventive program with
  in-class skills training and PLOS-extra, a six-session, individual,
  modular skills training for students who still need support after
  PLOS-basic. This cluster randomized controlled trial compares the
  short- and long-term effects of PLOS-extra to practice-as-usual (PAU)
  with 213 first year students (aged 11-14, 78.9% male) who still had
  planning problems after PLOS-basic. Primary outcomes were homework
  problems and planning skills. Secondary outcomes included school
  motivation, classroom behavior, attention-deficit/hyperactivity
  disorder (ADHD) behaviors and school grades. We found no significant
  short- or long-term between-group differences on either the primary or
  the secondary outcome measures. Some significant improvements over
  time were present for both the PLOS-extra and the PAU group. The lack
  of effects of PLOS-extra may be attributed to a natural improvement of
  planning skills, the moderate severity of planning problems in our
  sample or the design of the program. Furthermore, the schools faced
  challenges in securing the necessary resources to implement the
  program effectively. Although PLOS-extra was developed in
  collaboration with end-users, these challenges demonstrate the
  complexity of developing training programs that are feasible within
  the educational context. School professionals and policymakers must
  decide whether to invest time, effort and resources into implementing
  evidence-based planning programs or in developing and testing new
  programs that offer support throughout daily academic life.

    explanation: >-
      The study randomized at the school level, satisfying the ERCT
      class-level-or-higher randomization requirement.
    quote: >-
      "Schools were randomized over the experimental (PLOS-extra) and
      control group (PAU only; see Fig. 1)." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Schools were randomized over the experimental (PLOS-extra) and
      control group (PAU only; see Fig. 1)." (p. 4)

      2) "Cluster randomization was performed using a computer-generated
      list of random numbers applied to schools with strata on school
      size and school educational level to obtain equal numbers of
      participants in each group." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomization at the class level or higher
      (school level also satisfies this requirement). The paper states
      that schools were randomized between PLOS-extra and PAU, and
      describes a computer-generated randomization procedure applied to
      schools.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met/not met because the
      study randomized at the school level, which is stronger than the
      required class-level randomization.

    explanation: >-
      Outcomes rely on internal school grades and questionnaires, not a
      standardized exam-based assessment.
    quote: >-
      "School grades were measured using the grades of the students over the
      complete schoolyear of the core subjects Mathematics, Dutch and
      English (that are given at each educational level and are mandatory
      by the Dutch Government) separately." (p. 8)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "School grades were measured using the grades of the students over the
      complete schoolyear of the core subjects Mathematics, Dutch and
      English (that are given at each educational level and are mandatory
      by the Dutch Government) separately." (p. 8)

      2) "Twelve classes (of five different schools) worked with other
      grading systems that did not use numeric grades (in a scale from
      0-10)." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires a standardized exam-based assessment that is
      widely recognized and comparable across participants. The paper
      measures academic performance using schools' own grading records,
      and explicitly notes heterogeneity in grading systems that required
      translation into numeric grades.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is met/not met because the
      study used non-standardized internal grades (and questionnaires)
      rather than a single standardized external exam.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The interval from intervention start after the January pre-test to
      the May/June post-test exceeds one academic term.
    quote: >-
      "We conducted three measurements in both school years in which
      participating students, parents and mentor-teachers completed a
      questionnaire: 1) pre-test (December/January) 2) post-test
      (May/June) and 3) 6 months follow-up (October/November; only
      students and their parents; see Fig. 1)." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We conducted three measurements in both school years in which
      participating students, parents and mentor-teachers completed a
      questionnaire: 1) pre-test (December/January) 2) post-test
      (May/June) and 3) 6 months follow-up (October/November; only
      students and their parents; see Fig. 1)." (p. 4)

      2) "After the pre-test (January), students with planning problems were
      identified and students within the experimental PLOS-extra group
      were offered to receive PLOS-extra via an additional information
      letter." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcomes to be measured at least one academic
      term after the intervention begins. The procedures indicate that
      students were identified after the January pre-test and then began
      the PLOS-extra phase; the post-test occurred in May/June. This is
      roughly 4-6 months after January, which is at least one term.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met/not met because the
      post-test in May/June occurred more than one term after the January
      pre-test and the start of the PLOS-extra phase.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The paper documents the PAU control group size, characteristics,
      and what support it could receive.
    quote: >-
      "Table 2 shows the characteristics of the 213 students who were
      included the intent-to-treat analyses, of which 110 were in the
      experimental PLOS-extra group and 103 were in the PAU only group."
      (p. 9)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Table 2 shows the characteristics of the 213 students who were
      included the intent-to-treat analyses, of which 110 were in the
      experimental PLOS-extra group and 103 were in the PAU only group."
      (p. 9)

      2) "Participants in the PAU only group did not receive PLOS-extra
      but could receive support the school would normally provide or would
      be initiated outside of school, if available." (p. 7)

      3) "Of the participants in the PAU only group, 22.4% indicated that they
      had received extra support within the school (homework support,
      tutoring in a specific course and planning skills support) and 7.8%
      of the participants indicated receiving extra support outside of
      school (homework support, mental health care support and tutoring
      in a specific course)." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires a well-documented control group (who they are,
      baseline characteristics, and what they received). The paper reports
      the PAU group size and provides baseline characteristics in Table 2,
      and it describes the PAU condition and quantifies additional support
      received in each group.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met/not met because the
      control group is clearly described in both tabular form and text,
      including what PAU support could occur.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Schools were the unit of randomization, meeting the school-level RCT
      criterion.
    quote: >-
      "Schools were randomized over the experimental (PLOS-extra) and
      control group (PAU only; see Fig. 1)." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Schools were randomized over the experimental (PLOS-extra) and
      control group (PAU only; see Fig. 1)." (p. 4)

      2) "Eventually, fifteen schools were randomized to the PLOS-extra
      group and ten schools were randomized to the PAU only group." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization among schools (not only among
      classes or students). The paper explicitly states that schools were
      randomized and reports the number of schools assigned to each arm.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is met/not met because the
      unit of randomization was the school.
  i:

    explanation: >-
      The intervention was evaluated with substantial involvement of the
      intervention developers and author-led trainer training.
    quote: >-
      "Bianca Boyer is co-developer and author of the intervention manuals
      ‘Plan My Life’, ‘Solution Focused Treatment’ and ‘My Sleep Plan’ and
      receives royalties for the sales of the interventions." (p. 1)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Bianca Boyer is co-developer and author of the intervention
      manuals ‘Plan My Life’, ‘Solution Focused Treatment’ and ‘My Sleep
      Plan’ and receives royalties for the sales of the interventions."
      (p. 1)

      2) "Further, she is co-developer and author of the intervention
      manuals ‘Plan My Life’ and ‘Solution Focused Treatment’ but does not
      receive royalties for the sales of the interventions." (p. 1)

      3) "PLOS-extra trainers were trained in providing PLOS-extra by one
      of the authors (B.B., health care psychologist and author of PLOS) in
      a two-hour online training." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the evaluation be conducted independently
      from the intervention designers. The paper discloses that one author
      (Boyer) is a co-developer of intervention manuals and receives
      royalties, and that trainers were trained by an author described as
      "author of PLOS". These statements indicate direct involvement of
      intervention developers in implementation support and, by
      implication, in the evaluation process.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is met/not met because the
      intervention developers were involved in trainer training and the
      author team includes co-developers, so the study is not clearly
      independent.

      Outcomes were tracked from the December/January pre-test to an
      October/November follow-up, spanning roughly 9-10 months.
    quote: >-
      "We conducted three measurements in both school years in which
      participating students, parents and mentor-teachers completed a

      students and their parents; see Fig. 1)." (p. 4)

      2) "Data were collected over two school years (school year 1: 2021/22,
      school year 2: 2022/23). During both school years, we used the same
      cluster randomized controlled trial design." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least one academic year
      after the intervention begins (typically about 9-10 months). The
      reported schedule includes a pre-test in December/January and a
      follow-up in October/November, which spans about 9-11 months and
      covers an academic-year-length interval.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is met/not met because the
      study includes an October/November follow-up roughly 9-10 months
      after the December/January pre-test period.

    explanation: >-
      The extra time and staffing are integral to the intervention being
      tested (PLOS-extra), so PAU as the control is acceptable under the
      ERCT criterion B exception.
    quote: >-
      "PLOS-extra (Boyer et al., 2021) is a modular skills training program
      that consists of six individual meetings, each lasting

      2) "Participants in the PAU only group did not receive PLOS-extra
      but could receive support the school would normally provide or would
      be initiated outside of school, if available." (p. 7)

      3) "This cluster randomized controlled trial compares the short- and
      long-term effects of PLOS-extra to practice-as-usual (PAU) with 213
      first year students (aged 11-14, 78.9% male) who still had planning
      problems after PLOS-basic." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B asks whether additional resources (time, staffing,
      materials) are balanced between intervention and control, unless the
      additional resources are explicitly the treatment variable being
      tested. Here, the intervention is PLOS-extra itself, defined as six
      individual meetings delivered by a school mental health worker or
      trained staff. This implies additional staff time relative to
      business-as-usual.

      The control condition is explicitly practice-as-usual and does not
      include PLOS-extra sessions. This is an imbalance in resources, but
      it is integral to what PLOS-extra is. The study's stated purpose is
      to compare the effects of providing this extra, structured skills
      training against PAU, so the additional time and staffing are the
      core treatment package rather than a supplementary add-on.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met/not met because the
      intervention explicitly tests the provision of PLOS-extra sessions as
      the treatment package against business-as-usual.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication of this specific PLOS-extra effectiveness
      trial was located.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "For that reason, the new Dutch school-based program ‘Planning of
      Schoolwork’ (Wolters et al., 2021b; Boyer et al., 2021) was
      developed to support students in secondary education with planning
      problems." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication by a different
      research team, in a different context, published in a peer-reviewed
      journal. The paper presents PLOS-extra as a new program and does not
      cite any independent replication of this specific trial. Targeted
      searches for an external replication of PLOS-extra did not identify
      a peer-reviewed replication study.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is met/not met because no
      independent peer-reviewed replication of the PLOS-extra trial was
      found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Criterion A is not met because criterion E (standardized exam-based
      assessment) is not met.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "School grades were measured using the grades of the students over the
      complete schoolyear of the core subjects Mathematics, Dutch and
      English (that are given at each educational level and are mandatory
      by the Dutch Government) separately." (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all
      main subjects, and the ERCT rules specify that if criterion E is not
      met, criterion A cannot be met either. Because the study uses
      internal grades rather than standardized exams, criterion A fails.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is met/not met because it
      depends on criterion E, which is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The trial followed students for six months, not through graduation,
      and no graduation follow-up paper was located.

      problems after PLOS-basic." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking the cohort until graduation from the
      educational stage. The participants are first-year secondary school
      students, and the paper reports follow-up only through an
      October/November measurement described as a "6 months follow-up".
      This stops far short of secondary school graduation.

      A targeted search for subsequent publications by the same authors
      tracking this cohort through graduation did not identify a
      peer-reviewed graduation follow-up report.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is met/not met because the
      study stops at a six-month follow-up and provides no evidence of
      tracking the cohort to graduation.

      The paper reports prospective preregistration in REES before data

    quote: >-
      "This study's design was preregistered prospectively at Registry of

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study's design was preregistered prospectively at Registry of
      Efficacy and Effectiveness Studies (REES) before data were collected
      (ID 9680.1v2)." (p. 5)

      2) "At the beginning of the school year (September) participating school
      staff sent all first year students and their parents an information
      letter that described the aim and procedure of the study and the
      students and their parents were asked to give informed consent for
      data collection." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires preregistration of the study protocol before
      data collection begins. The paper explicitly states that the design
      was preregistered prospectively in REES and provides a registry ID.
      The procedures describe that schools began requesting consent for
      data collection at the beginning of the school year (September),
      with pre-test in December/January.

      An attempt to verify the REES registry entry date directly was not
      possible because the REES site requires sign-in. Therefore, the
      timing is supported by the paper's explicit statement but not
      independently confirmed from the registry metadata.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is met/not met because the
      paper states prospective REES preregistration before data collection,
      although the registry timestamp could not be verified without
      access.
