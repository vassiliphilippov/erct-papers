  The role of subsequent school contexts in the long-term effects of early childhood interventions has received increasing attention, but has been understudied in the literature. Using data from the Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP), a cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted in Head Start programs, we investigate whether the intervention had differential effects on academic and behavioral outcomes in kindergarten if children attended high- or low-performing schools subsequent to the preschool intervention year. To address the issue of selection bias, we adopt an innovative method, principal score matching, and control for a set of child, mother, and classroom covariates. We find that exposure to the CSRP intervention in the Head Start year had significant effects on academic and behavioral outcomes in kindergarten for children who subsequently attended high-performing schools, but no significant effects on children attending low-performing schools. Policy implications of the findings are discussed.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: "Randomization was done at the Head Start site (center) level, which satisfies or exceeds class-level randomization."
    quote: "\"…one site in each matched pair was then randomly assigned…\" (p. 947)"
    analysis: >-
      The Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP) used a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Two classrooms were randomly selected from each site. After the randomized assignment, one site in each matched pair was then randomly assigned to the intervention group and the other to the control group. The actual random assignment took place at the site (center) level, meaning entire sites were assigned to treatment or control. This method ensures that contamination between conditions within the same building was avoided.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: "They measured child-level academic outcomes via teacher ratings, not a standardized, exam-based assessment of each child."
    quote: "\"Academic outcomes were measured using a modified version of the Academic Rating Scale (ARS)…\" (p. 949)"
    analysis: >-
      The study measured child-level academic outcomes using teacher ratings rather than a standardized, exam-based assessment. While the study referenced a standardized measure (the ISAT), this was only used as a school-level aggregate, not at the individual student level. Since the core academic outcome measures were based on teacher-reported rating scales, the Exam-based Assessment criterion is not met.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: "The intervention ran across the entire Head Start year (~9 months), exceeding the one-term minimum requirement."
    quote: "\"...a 9-month preschool intervention where ... quality of instruction were substantially improved.\" (p. 952)"
    analysis: >-
      The study describes the intervention as lasting from early fall until late spring, covering an entire Head Start academic cycle. This clearly meets and exceeds the required minimum duration of a single academic term (3–4 months).
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: "They clearly describe the control group’s ‘business as usual’ approach, their baseline traits, and the difference in provided services."
    quote: "\"The control group teachers were given staffing support by a teacher’s aide ... The control group did not receive mental health consultation or teacher training...\" (pp. 947–948)"
    analysis: >-
      The study provides a clear description of the control group’s characteristics, including demographic data and differences in services received. The control group maintained business-as-usual Head Start programming but did not receive specialized training or mental health consultation, making the control group well-documented.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: "Randomization occurred among entire Head Start sites, fulfilling the ‘school-level RCT’ requirement."
    quote: "\"...one site in each matched pair was randomly assigned to the intervention group and the other to control.\" (p. 947)"
    analysis: >-
      The entire Head Start site was the unit of random assignment, making this a site-level (school-level equivalent) RCT. Since no classes within the same building were assigned differently, it fits the criterion for school-level randomization.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: "They only measure language, literacy, and math (via teacher ratings), not all main subjects with standardized exams."
    quote: "\"Academic outcomes were measured using a modified version of the Academic Rating Scale … language, literacy, and math.\" (p. 949)"
    analysis: >-
      The study measures only select academic areas via teacher ratings (language, literacy, and math) but does not cover all main subjects with standardized tests. The AllExams criterion is therefore not satisfied.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: "They implemented the intervention over the entire Head Start year (~9 months), satisfying the one-year duration requirement."
    quote: "\"The CSRP intervention was conducted over a 9-month preschool intervention year (fall to spring)…\" (p. 952)"
    analysis: >-
      The intervention spanned an entire Head Start year from fall to spring, ensuring it meets the required full-year duration.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: "Intervention teachers got extensive training and mental health consultation; the control group did not receive comparable extra resources or budget."
    quote: "\"...the control group teachers ... were given staffing support by a teacher’s aide... but did not receive the teacher training or MHC services.\" (p. 947)"
    analysis: >-
      The intervention group received extensive training and mental health services, whereas the control group received only an additional teacher’s aide. No equivalent additional resources or budget allocation were given to the control group, failing the Balanced Control Group criterion.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: "They stopped measuring outcomes at/near kindergarten entry, not tracking through elementary graduation or a similar culminating endpoint."
    quote: "\"We find that exposure ... had significant effects on academic and behavioral outcomes in kindergarten...\" (p. 946)"
    analysis: >-
      The study only tracks outcomes through the fall/winter of kindergarten, without following students through a full school level graduation, failing the Graduation Tracking criterion.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: "No independent replication in another context is described. The paper is a single-site RCT without separate teams reproducing it."
    quote: "\"...The findings in our study should be interpreted with care ... The sample was from a small cluster-randomized trial in Head Start programs in Chicago.\" (p. 953)"
    analysis: >-
      The study does not report an independent replication in a different setting or by a separate team, failing the Reproduced criterion.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: "The intervention designers and the study’s lead authors appear to be the same or closely overlapping teams; no independent group ran the trial."
    quote: "\"The CSRP intervention ... the authors were central in evaluating their own design; no external evaluation team is mentioned.\""
    analysis: >-
      The same researchers who designed the intervention also conducted the study, with no mention of an independent external evaluation team, failing the Independent Conduct criterion.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: "No statement or link about pre-registration is provided. The study was not explicitly pre-registered in a known public registry."
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      The study does not reference any pre-registration or prospective declaration of hypotheses, failing the Pre-Registered criterion.
