abstract: >-
  Research on digital personalised learning (DPL) alongside classroom teaching is
  limited in low- and middle-income countries. This study investigates, for the
  first time, a DPL programme aligned with national curricula and teaching
  practices. A randomised trial evaluated the impact of ‘classroom-integrated’
  DPL on pre-primary literacy and numeracy in Kenya, involving 1955 learners aged
  4 to 6 across 291 government schools. Learners engaged with DPL via a
  smartphone. DPL personalised the sequence of digital learning units based on
  learners’ device usage and teachers’ progression through digitised structured
  pedagogy lesson plans, while teachers could use their judgement to align DPL
  with teaching. Numeracy and literacy were assessed over 13 months. The
  findings show an effect of 0.534 SD from baseline to endline, with similar
  numeracy (0.450 SD) and literacy (0.449 SD) impacts. The intervention was
  effective for boys and girls and across class sizes, and there was no clear
  differential impact for low- or high-achieving learners. However, a reduction
  in the extent of effectiveness after midline suggests potential exhaustion of
  appropriate DPL content, indicating a need to consider the suitability of
  content and the optimum duration for implementation. This research
  significantly enhances the critical understanding of DPL when integrated with
  a standardised curriculum and classroom practice.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Randomisation was at the school (cluster) level, which meets or exceeds
      the class-level requirement.
    quote: >-
      "The random allocation of all schools to treatment or control groups was
      carried out in August 2022."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "During this research, a stratified, two-arm, cluster-RCT with one
      treatment and one control group compared learning gains following the
      implementation of DPL over four school terms." (Section 4, Methods)

      2) "The random allocation of all schools to treatment or control groups
      was carried out in August 2022." (Section 4.2.1)

      3) "Schools (n = 316) in each sub-county were randomly assigned to
      ‘treatment’ or ‘control’ in Microsoft Excel following methodological
      guidance (J-PAL, no date)." (Section 4.2.1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires random assignment at the class level (or stronger),
      to reduce contamination that can arise from within-class student
      randomisation. The paper describes a "cluster-RCT" and explicitly states
      that "all schools" were randomly allocated to treatment or control. Since
      the unit of randomisation is the school (a stronger unit than class),
      this satisfies Criterion C.

      Criterion C is met because entire schools (clusters) were randomly
      assigned to treatment or control.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study used IDELA, a widely used and validated standardized early
      learning assessment tool.
    quote: >-
      "To evaluate the primary study outcomes, the free-to-access IDELA tool was
      used to assess emergent numeracy and literacy skills."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To evaluate the primary study outcomes, the free-to-access IDELA tool
      was used to assess emergent numeracy and literacy skills." (Section 4.5.1)

      2) "Developed by Save the Children, IDELA was rigorously piloted with 5300
      learners across 11 countries over three years." (Section 4.5.1)

      3) "Validated for children aged 3–6 years, internal consistency, construct
      validity, and inter-rater and test–retest reliability are established
      (Pisani, Borisova, and Dowd 2015, 2018; Wolf et al. 2017)." (Section 4.5.1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires exam-based assessment using a standardized, widely
      recognised instrument rather than a bespoke, researcher-created test
      designed around the intervention. The paper identifies IDELA as the
      assessment tool, describes it as developed by Save the Children, and notes
      established validity and reliability evidence. This supports that the
      assessment is standardized and externally developed, not created for this
      RCT.

      Criterion E is met because outcomes were assessed using the standardized
      and validated IDELA tool.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were tracked from October 2022 to October 2023, far exceeding a
      one-term minimum.
    quote: >-
      "Assessment points were baseline (October 2022), midline (May 2023), and
      endline (October 2023)."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Numeracy and literacy were assessed over 13 months." (Abstract)

      2) "Assessment points were baseline (October 2022), midline (May 2023),
      and endline (October 2023)." (Section 4, Methods)

      3) "Using the EIDU DPL tool (Friedberg 2023), research took place during
      the 2022 and 2023 school years." (Section 1.1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that outcomes be measured at least one full academic
      term after the intervention begins (typically ~3–4 months). The paper
      reports baseline in October 2022 and endline in October 2023, and also
      states assessment occurred "over 13 months." This comfortably exceeds one
      term, and the timing is explicitly documented.

      Criterion T is met because the study measured outcomes over about 13
      months from baseline to endline.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control group is described as business-as-usual and baseline
      characteristics and scores are reported for comparison.
    quote: >-
      "Control schools did not receive the DPL tool and continued to teach as
      usual, following the Kenyan pre-primary national curriculum."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Control schools did not receive the DPL tool and continued to teach as
      usual, following the Kenyan pre-primary national curriculum." (Section
      4.4.2)

      2) "Table 3. Comparison of learner characteristics and assessment scores in
      treatment and control groups at baseline (post-attrition)." (Table 3
      caption)

      3) "Overall IDELA score (mean and SD) 0.284 (0.156 SD) 0.280 (0.151 SD)"
      (Table 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control group be well documented, including
      what it received (or did not receive), plus clear reporting of baseline
      characteristics/performance. The paper states that control schools did not
      receive the DPL tool and continued usual instruction under the national
      curriculum. It also provides a baseline comparison table (Table 3) that
      includes sample sizes and baseline scores (overall IDELA, numeracy, and
      literacy), supporting comparability documentation.

      Criterion D is met because the control condition is explicitly described
      and baseline scores and sample characteristics are reported.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Schools were randomly assigned to treatment or control, satisfying the
      school-level RCT requirement.
    quote: >-
      "Schools (n = 316) in each sub-county were randomly assigned to ‘treatment’
      or ‘control’ in Microsoft Excel following methodological guidance (J-PAL,
      no date)."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "School-level randomisation" (Section heading 4.2.1)

      2) "Schools (n = 316) in each sub-county were randomly assigned to
      ‘treatment’ or ‘control’ in Microsoft Excel following methodological
      guidance (J-PAL, no date)." (Section 4.2.1)

      3) "A final randomised sample of 291 schools was assessed at baseline to
      address discrepancies in school enrolment figures, resulting in fewer
      learners being available for assessment in practice." (Section 4.1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomisation among schools (or equivalent educational
      sites). The paper explicitly labels "School-level randomisation" and
      describes randomly assigning schools within each sub-county to treatment or
      control. It also reports the final randomised school sample size.

      Criterion S is met because the unit of randomisation was the school.
  i:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The paper states the DPL provider did not participate in data collection,
      analysis, or conclusions, supporting independent conduct.
    quote: >-
      "It is important to note that the research team maintained full
      independence in their collaboration with the DPL provider, who did not
      participate in data collection, analysis, or the formulation of
      conclusions."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "It is important to note that the research team maintained full
      independence in their collaboration with the DPL provider, who did not
      participate in data collection, analysis, or the formulation of
      conclusions." (Section 4, Methods)

      2) "While enumerators may potentially have been aware of the treatment
      status due to the visibility of DPL technology in schools, they were
      entirely independent of the treatment, ensuring no conflict of interest."
      (Section 4.7)

      3) "One author (AF) was contracted by the DPL tool provider during the
      research period; however, they did not participate in undertaking data
      collection, analysis, or the formulation of conclusions." (Disclosure
      statement)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires credible separation between the intervention
      provider/designer and those collecting/analyzing outcome data, to reduce
      bias. The paper explicitly states the provider did not participate in data
      collection, analysis, or conclusions. It also discloses a potential
      relationship (one author contracted by the provider) and explicitly limits
      that author’s role away from data collection, analysis, and conclusions.
      Finally, the paper states enumerators were independent.

      Criterion I is met because the paper explicitly documents independence from
      the provider for data collection, analysis, and conclusions.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured over about 13 months and four school terms, meeting
      the year-duration threshold.
    quote: >-
      "Numeracy and literacy were assessed over 13 months."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Numeracy and literacy were assessed over 13 months." (Abstract)

      2) "During this research, a stratified, two-arm, cluster-RCT with one
      treatment and one control group compared learning gains following the
      implementation of DPL over four school terms." (Section 4, Methods)

      3) "Assessment points were baseline (October 2022), midline (May 2023),
      and endline (October 2023)." (Section 4, Methods)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcomes measured at least 75% of one academic year
      after the intervention begins. The study spans baseline in October 2022
      through endline in October 2023 and explicitly states assessment occurred
      over 13 months. The methods also describe the intervention/tracking as
      occurring over four school terms. This exceeds 75% of a typical academic
      year.

      Criterion Y is met because the study tracked outcomes from October 2022 to
      October 2023 (about 13 months).
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention added devices and implementation support, but these
      additional resources are integral to the DPL treatment being tested against
      business-as-usual.
    quote: >-
      "Control schools did not receive the DPL tool and continued to teach as
      usual, following the Kenyan pre-primary national curriculum."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Learners engaged with DPL via a smartphone." (Abstract)

      2) "Two Android devices are provided per classroom in a phased rollout
      (Section 4.4.1)." (Section 3.2.4)

      3) "At this point, schools received a second Android device per classroom."
      (Section 4.4.1)

      4) "ECDOs overseeing treatment schools were trained by EIDU to deliver
      ongoing support to teachers regarding the delivery of the Tayari lesson
      plans and deployment of the DPL tool in classrooms." (Section 3.2.2)

      5) "Control schools did not receive the DPL tool and continued to teach as
      usual, following the Kenyan pre-primary national curriculum." (Section
      4.4.2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B compares the nature, quantity, and quality of resources (time,
      budget, materials, support) provided to treatment vs control, and asks
      whether the control condition provides a comparable substitute for the
      intervention’s inputs, unless the additional resources are explicitly the
      treatment variable (i.e., integral to what is being tested).

      This intervention includes access to DPL via smartphones and provision of
      Android devices, plus training/ongoing support via ECDOs trained to support
      DPL/Tayari delivery. Control schools "did not receive the DPL tool" and
      continued business-as-usual instruction. This is a material and support
      difference.

      Applying the Criterion B decision logic: extra resources are present
      (devices/support). These resources are integral to the intervention being
      evaluated (a classroom-integrated DPL programme), rather than a separable,
      unintended add-on; the study’s intent is to test the effect of providing
      this DPL package versus business-as-usual.

      Criterion B is met because the added devices and support are integral to
      the DPL intervention being tested against business-as-usual.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication of this specific trial by a different research
      team could be identified from the paper or from web searching.
    quote: >-
      "This study investigates, for the first time, a DPL programme aligned with
      national curricula and teaching practices."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study investigates, for the first time, a DPL programme aligned
      with national curricula and teaching practices." (Abstract)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires evidence that the study (or a substantially identical
      evaluation of the same intervention) has been independently replicated by a
      different team in a peer-reviewed outlet.

      The paper frames the evaluation as being conducted "for the first time"
      and does not cite an independent replication.

      Internet search (performed 2026-02-21) for independent replications of
      this specific Murang’a County (291 schools; baseline October 2022, endline
      October 2023) cluster-RCT did not identify a peer-reviewed replication by
      an independent author team. Results found included project pages, blog
      posts, and related (non-replication) publications about DPL/EIDU, but not
      an independent replication of this RCT.

      Criterion R is not met because independent replication of this specific
      trial was not found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study assessed standardized outcomes in literacy and numeracy only, not
      all main subject areas for the educational setting.
    quote: >-
      "IDELA’s seven numeracy and seven literacy assessment items were utilised
      during the study (Appendix C)."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "IDELA’s seven numeracy and seven literacy assessment items were
      utilised during the study (Appendix C)." (Section 4.5.1)

      2) "Primary study outcomes assessed the effectiveness of a curriculum-
      aligned and classroom-integrated DPL programme in improving pre-primary
      literacy and numeracy skills." (Section 1.1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires exam-based assessment across all main subjects taught
      at the relevant educational level (or a clearly justified specialised
      exception). The paper states that the study used IDELA numeracy and
      literacy items, and frames the primary outcomes specifically as literacy
      and numeracy.

      No evidence is provided in the paper text that all main subjects were
      assessed using standardized exams, and no specialised-intervention
      exception is argued that would justify limited subject coverage under the
      ERCT standard.

      Criterion A is not met because only literacy and numeracy were assessed,
      rather than all main subjects.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No evidence was found that the study tracked learners until graduation, and
      web searching did not identify follow-up publications tracking this cohort
      through graduation.
    quote: >-
      "Assessment points were baseline (October 2022), midline (May 2023), and
      endline (October 2023)."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Assessment points were baseline (October 2022), midline (May 2023), and
      endline (October 2023)." (Section 4, Methods)

      2) "Control schools only received DPL after the endline in January 2024,
      meaning benefits will be available to future learners, but not the control
      sample itself." (Section 4.7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires follow-up tracking until participants graduate from
      the relevant educational stage. The paper specifies that outcome assessment
      ended at "endline (October 2023)" and discusses post-endline rollout to
      control schools in January 2024, but it does not describe subsequent
      outcome data collection through any graduation milestone.

      Internet search (performed 2026-02-21) for follow-up papers by the same
      author group tracking this RCT cohort through graduation did not identify
      any such graduation-tracking publication.

      Criterion G is not met because follow-up ended at October 2023 and no
      graduation-tracking follow-up publication was found.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The protocol was registered/published after data collection began, so it
      does not meet the ERCT requirement for pre-registration before the study
      started.
    quote: >-
      "Published on  14 October 2023"
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes (this paper):

      1) "The random allocation of all schools to treatment or control groups was
      carried out in August 2022." (Section 4.2.1)

      2) "Assessment points were baseline (October 2022), midline (May 2023), and
      endline (October 2023)." (Section 4, Methods)

      3) "Details of the study’s design, methodology, and analysis plan were
      documented in a comprehensive research protocol, independently reviewed
      following peer-feedback, and registered on an open-access research
      repository prior to analysis to promote transparency and safeguard trial
      integrity (Major et al. 2023)." (Section 4, Methods)

      Relevant Quotes (protocol repository record):

      1) "Published on  14 October 2023" (EdTech Hub protocol page)

      2) "The protocol is being disseminated prior to endline data analysis to
      promote transparency and a comprehensive understanding of the RCT approach
      and design." (EdTech Hub protocol page)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the full study protocol be pre-registered before
      the study begins (i.e., before randomisation and/or baseline data
      collection), with a registration date that predates study start.

      The paper states the protocol was registered on an open-access repository
      "prior to analysis," which does not itself establish pre-registration prior
      to data collection.

      The associated public protocol record is shown as "Published on  14 October
      2023" and describes dissemination "prior to endline data analysis." The
      trial’s random allocation occurred in August 2022 and baseline assessment
      occurred in October 2022, so the protocol publication date is after data
      collection had already begun.

      Criterion P is not met because the protocol record is dated October 14,
      2023, which is after randomisation and baseline data collection.

- Added metadata:
  - `paper_link` set to the DOI landing page.
  - `pdf_link` set to the publisher-style direct PDF URL.
  - `date_erct_check` set to **2026-02-21**.
- Quote corrections / cleanup:
  - Replaced the Criterion C `quote` that previously contained an ellipsis with
    a complete verbatim sentence from the paper.
  - Standardised wording in multiple criteria to remove trailing ellipses and
    ensure quotes are complete sentences as shown in the paper text provided.
- Criteria re-checks requiring internet searching:
  - **P (Pre-registered Protocol):** Found the public protocol record on EdTech
    Hub dated **14 October 2023** (after baseline in **October 2022**), so P
    remains **not met** and the analysis was updated with verbatim quotes from
    that record.
  - **R (Reproduced):** Web searching did not identify an independent peer-
    reviewed replication of this specific RCT; R remains **not met**.
  - **G (Graduation Tracking):** Web searching did not identify graduation-
    tracking follow-ups for this cohort; G remains **not met**.
- ERCT level:
  - Confirmed **erct_level = 2** remains correct because all Level 1 (C, E, T,
    D) and Level 2 (S, I, Y, B) criteria are met, while Level 3 criteria are
    not all met.
