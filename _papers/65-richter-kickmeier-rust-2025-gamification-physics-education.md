abstract: >-
  We examine whether highlighting streaks - instances of repeated and
  consecutive behavior when completing learning tasks - encourages 4th to 6th
  grade students in Peru to increase their use of an online math platform
  and improve learning. 60,000 students were randomly assigned to receive
  messages that (i) highlighted streaks, (ii) provided personalized
  reminders with positive reinforcement, (iii) provided generic reminders,
  or (iv) to a control group. Highlighting streaks and providing
  personalized reminders significantly increased platform use compared to
  generic reminders and the control group, with streaks more effective on
  the intensive margin and personalized reminders more effective on the
  extensive margin. Highlighting streaks also significantly improved math
  achievement compared to the control group among the 1,500 students who
  took an endline test, although differences with other treatment arms were
  not significant.

    explanation: >-
      The study randomized at the student level rather than at the class or
      school level.
    quote: >-
      "60,000 students were randomly assigned to receive messages that (i)
      highlighted streaks, (ii) provided personalized reminders with
      positive reinforcement, (iii) provided generic reminders, or (iv) to a

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "60,000 students were randomly assigned to receive messages that
      (i) highlighted streaks, (ii) provided personalized reminders with
      positive reinforcement, (iii) provided generic reminders, or (iv) to a
      control group." (p. 1)

      2) "Randomization to treatment was carried out after the baseline test
      and stratified based on whether the student had completed the baseline
      test and the number of weeks that the student used the platform in
      2021." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomization at the class level (or stronger at
      the school level), unless the intervention is explicitly one-to-one
      tutoring. The paper states that "students were randomly assigned" and
      describes student-level stratification, which indicates the unit of
      randomization is the individual student rather than a class or a
      school. The intervention is app notifications (messages), not personal
      tutoring, so the tutoring exception does not apply.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is not met because
      randomization was at the student level rather than the class (or
      school) level.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured with app-administered tests closely aligned to
      the treatment exercises rather than a standardized external exam.
    quote: >-
      "The baseline test and endline test were administered through the app
      and had a very similar format. They were closely aligned with the
      exercises included in the six-week treatment period..." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The baseline test and endline test were administered through the
      app and had a very similar format. They were closely aligned with the
      exercises included in the six-week treatment period and included 30
      exercises covering all the topics presented during the treatment
      period (i.e., 15 exercises for numeracy, and 5 for geometry,
      probability, and patterns, respectively)." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires a widely recognized standardized exam, not a
      custom instrument created for or tightly aligned to the intervention.
      The paper explicitly states the baseline and endline tests were
      administered through the app and were "closely aligned" with the
      treatment-period exercises. That indicates a study-specific
      assessment rather than an external standardized exam.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is not met because the study
      used app-based tests closely aligned with the intervention rather than
      a standardized external exam.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention and outcome window was six weeks, which is shorter
      than a full academic term.
    quote: >-
      "Our intervention took place during six weeks of the summer break
      starting from the week of January 17, 2022, and until the week of
      February 21, 2022." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Our intervention took place during six weeks of the summer break
      starting from the week of January 17, 2022, and until the week of
      February 21, 2022." (p. 3)

      2) "We also conducted a baseline test and an endline test, which took
      place in the weeks immediately before and after the six-week
      treatment period." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcomes to be measured at least one full
      academic term after the intervention begins (typically about 3-4
      months). The paper specifies a six-week intervention period, with the
      endline test occurring immediately after. This does not meet the term
      duration requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is not met because outcomes
      were measured around a six-week window rather than at least one full
      academic term after the start.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control group is clearly described, including its notification
      condition and baseline characteristics.
    quote: >-
      "During the six-week treatment period, the control group did not
      receive any further notifications, while the three treatment groups
      received different types of app notifications each week." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "During the six-week treatment period, the control group did not
      receive any further notifications, while the three treatment groups
      received different types of app notifications each week." (p. 3)

      2) "Forty percent of the sample, or 24,000 students, were assigned to
      the control group, while 20 percent of the sample, or 12,000 students,
      were assigned to each of the three treatment groups: Streak,
      Personalized Reminder, and Generic Reminder." (p. 4)

      3) "Table 1 examines baseline balance across the four treatment arms
      for two relevant samples: all students, and students who took the
      endline test (in panels A and B, respectively). Column 1 presents
      means for the control group..." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires a well-documented control group, including the
      control condition and baseline information. The paper states the
      control group received no further notifications during treatment and
      provides the control group size and assignment shares. It also
      explicitly describes that Table 1 reports baseline balance with
      control-group means, which supplies the needed baseline documentation.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because the control
      condition is explicitly defined and baseline control-group statistics
      are documented in the paper.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization occurred at the student level rather than the school
      level.
    quote: >-
      "60,000 students were randomly assigned to receive messages that (i)
      highlighted streaks, (ii) provided personalized reminders with
      positive reinforcement, (iii) provided generic reminders, or (iv) to a
      control group." (p. 1)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "60,000 students were randomly assigned to receive messages that
      (i) highlighted streaks, (ii) provided personalized reminders with
      positive reinforcement, (iii) provided generic reminders, or (iv) to a
      control group." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level randomization. The quoted sentence
      identifies students as the randomized unit, and the paper does not
      describe random assignment of schools.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is not met because the unit
      of randomization was students rather than schools.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper does not provide a clear statement that the evaluation was
      conducted by an independent third party separate from the intervention
      team.
    quote: >-
      "The learning platform used in this study, called 'Conecta Ideas,'
      included a student app that was developed at the Center for Advanced
      Research on Education at the Universidad de Chile (and owned by the
      firm AutoMind)." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The learning platform used in this study, called 'Conecta Ideas,'
      included a student app that was developed at the Center for Advanced
      Research on Education at the Universidad de Chile (and owned by the
      firm AutoMind)." (p. 3)

      2) "This project is the result of a large collaborative effort." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires explicit evidence that the study was conducted
      independently from the designers or implementers of the intervention.
      The paper describes development and ownership connections for the
      platform and does not contain a clear statement that an independent
      evaluation organization implemented the experiment or performed the
      analysis. In the absence of an explicit independence statement, the
      criterion is not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is not met because the paper
      does not provide clear evidence of independent third-party conduct of
      the evaluation.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention and measurement period was six weeks, not an academic
      year.
    quote: >-
      "Our intervention took place during six weeks of the summer break
      starting from the week of January 17, 2022, and until the week of
      February 21, 2022." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Our intervention took place during six weeks of the summer break
      starting from the week of January 17, 2022, and until the week of
      February 21, 2022." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcomes tracked for at least one full academic
      year after the intervention begins. The paper specifies a six-week
      summer intervention and does not report year-long tracking.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is not met because the study
      duration is six weeks rather than at least one academic year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The additional input (messages/notifications) is the treatment being
      tested, so a no-message control is the appropriate comparison.
    quote: >-
      "During the six-week treatment period, the control group did not
      receive any further notifications, while the three treatment groups
      received different types of app notifications each week." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We compare the effect of sending messages which (i) highlighted
      streaks of completed assignments, to messages which (ii) provided
      personalized reminders with positive reinforcement, (iii) provided
      generic reminders, and (iv) to a control group which did not receive
      any messages." (p. 2)

      2) "During the six-week treatment period, the control group did not
      receive any further notifications, while the three treatment groups
      received different types of app notifications each week." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B checks whether the intervention group receives extra time,
      budget, or resources that are not matched in the control group, unless
      those extra resources are explicitly the treatment variable being
      tested. Here, the intervention is defined as sending app messages.
      The control group continues with access to the same platform but does
      not receive the messages. This is exactly the intended counterfactual
      for testing the causal effect of the messages themselves, so the
      resource difference is integral to the treatment design.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met because the messages
      are the treatment variable, making a no-message control appropriate.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication study by other authors was found for this
      specific intervention.
    quote: >-
      "To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study examining the
      effects of highlighting streaks in an educational context." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study examining
      the effects of highlighting streaks in an educational context." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires independent reproduction by other researchers in
      a different context, published as a peer-reviewed replication.
      The paper positions itself as the first experimental educational
      study on this specific streak-highlighting intervention. A targeted
      web search for replications and follow-up RCTs of this exact
      intervention did not identify an independent replication paper by a
      separate author team.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is not met because no
      independent replication study was found for this intervention.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not measure standardized outcomes across all core
      subjects, and criterion E is not met.
    quote: >-
      "We also analyze effects on academic achievement, focusing on the
      subsample of students who completed the endline test." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We also analyze effects on academic achievement, focusing on the
      subsample of students who completed the endline test." (p. 3)

      2) "The main outcomes in the study are measures of platform use and
      student math scores on the endline test." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based measurement across all
      main subjects, and it explicitly depends on criterion E being met.
      This study reports only mathematics achievement from an app-based
      endline test and does not report standardized exams across multiple
      subjects. Since criterion E is not met, criterion A cannot be met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because outcomes
      are limited to math (and not via standardized all-subject exams), and
      criterion E is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not track participants to graduation and also fails the
      year-duration prerequisite (criterion Y).
    quote: >-
      "While we cannot assess persistence following the end of treatment due
      to data limitations, we explore student behavior in the week following
      treatment when the endline test was administered." (p. 6)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "While we cannot assess persistence following the end of treatment
      due to data limitations, we explore student behavior in the week
      following treatment when the endline test was administered." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation and is
      constrained by the prerequisite that criterion Y must be met.
      The paper explicitly states it cannot assess persistence after the end
      of treatment and focuses only on the immediate post-treatment week.
      In addition, criterion Y is not met because the study does not track
      outcomes over a full academic year. A targeted search did not identify
      a subsequent follow-up paper by the same author team reporting
      graduation tracking for this cohort.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is not met because there is
      no graduation tracking (and criterion Y is not met).
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper provides ethics approval and data registration statements,
      but no evidence of a pre-registered study protocol.
    quote: >-
      "We received approval for this project from the Via Libre (Comite
      Institutional de Bioetica) ethics board and registered the Conecta
      Ideas data with the Ministry of Justice in Peru." (p. 1)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We received approval for this project from the Via Libre (Comite
      Institutional de Bioetica) ethics board and registered the Conecta
      Ideas data with the Ministry of Justice in Peru." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires a publicly accessible pre-registered protocol
      (hypotheses, methods, and analysis plan) registered before data
      collection began, typically with an identifiable registry entry or
      ID. The paper mentions ethics approval and registration of the data
      with a government ministry, but it does not cite a pre-registration
      registry entry for the study protocol. Attempts to verify a registry
      entry via the AEA RCT Registry were blocked in this environment, so no
      protocol registration could be confirmed beyond what is stated in the
      paper.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is not met because the paper
      does not provide evidence of a pre-registered study protocol.
