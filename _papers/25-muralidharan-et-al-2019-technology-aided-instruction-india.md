  We study the impact of a personalized technology‑aided after‑school 
  instruction
  program in middle‑school grades in urban India using a lottery that provided
  winners with free access to the program. Lottery winners scored 0.37σ higher 
  in math and 0.23σ higher in Hindi over just a 4.5‑month period. IV estimates 
  suggest that attending the program for 90 days would increase math and Hindi 
  test scores by 0.6σ and 0.39σ respectively. We find similar absolute test score 
  gains for all students, but much greater relative gains for academically‑weaker 
  students. Our results suggest that well‑designed, technology‑aided instruction 
  programs can sharply improve productivity in delivering education.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The 619 participants were individually randomized into treatment and 
      control groups with 305 students in the control and 314 in the treatment 
      group." (p. 9) 

      2) "Randomization was stratified by center‑batch preferences." (p. 9) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      These quotes make clear that randomisation occurred at the individual‑student
      level rather than at the class level. The ERCT Standard’s Class‑level RCT
      criterion requires entire classes (or schools) to be randomized to prevent
      contamination. Because students within the same cohort were assigned
      individually, this criterion is not met.

      Therefore, criterion C is not met because randomisation was conducted at
      the individual‑student level rather than at the class level.
    explanation: >
      Randomisation was conducted at the individual‑student level rather than at 
      the class level, so the Class‑level RCT criterion is not satisfied.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The tests were designed independently by the research team and intended
      to capture a wide range of student achievement." (p. 11) 

      2) "Test items ranged in difficulty from 'very easy' questions ... to
      'grade‑appropriate' competencies found in international assessments." (p. 11) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The assessment instruments were custom‑designed by the authors. The ERCT
      Exam‑based Assessment criterion requires use of a standardized, widely
      recognized exam. Since bespoke tests were used, this criterion is not met.

      Therefore, criterion E is not met because the study used custom‑designed
      assessments instead of a widely recognized standardized exam.
    explanation: >
      The study used researcher‑designed custom tests rather than a standardized,
      widely recognized exam, so the Exam‑based Assessment criterion is not 
      satisfied.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We measure program impacts using ... tests ... before and after the
      4.5‑month‑long intervention." (p. 3) 

      2) "Baseline assessments in September 2015 ... endline in February 2016."
      (p. 5) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention spanned approximately 4.5 months, exceeding a typical
      academic term of 3–4 months. Under the ERCT Term Duration criterion,
      measuring outcomes after at least one full term satisfies the requirement.

      Therefore, criterion T is met because outcomes were measured after a 4.5‑month
      period, exceeding a full academic term.
    explanation: >
      Outcomes were measured after a 4.5‑month intervention period, which covers 
      at least one term, satisfying the Term Duration criterion.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The treatment and control groups did not differ significantly at baseline
      on gender, socioeconomic status (SES), or baseline test scores (Table 1, 
      panel A)." (p. 9) 

      2) "Students not chosen by lottery ... completed an endline assessment."
      (p. 5) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Table 1 and its narrative describe the control group’s composition,
      demographics, and baseline performance. This clear documentation meets
      the Documented Control Group criterion.

      Therefore, criterion D is met because the control group’s characteristics and
      baseline performance are comprehensively documented.
    explanation: >
      The study provides detailed baseline characteristics and assessment outcomes
      for the control group, fulfilling the Documented Control Group criterion.

      1) "The 619 participants were individually randomized ..." (p. 9) 

      2) "Randomization was stratified by center‑batch preferences." (p. 9) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomisation occurred at the individual‑student level, not at the school
      level. The School‑level RCT criterion requires entire schools to be
      randomized. Hence this criterion is not met.

      Therefore, criterion S is not met because randomisation was not conducted at
      the school level.
    explanation: >
      Randomisation was done at the individual‑student level, not at the school 
      level, so the School‑level RCT criterion is not satisfied.

      2) "At the demonstration sessions, ... by EI staff." (p. 9) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The creators of the intervention also conducted the evaluation, with no
      independent third‑party oversight. Under the Independent Conduct criterion,
      this constitutes a failure.

      Therefore, criterion I is not met because the evaluation was not conducted
      independently of the intervention’s developers.
    explanation: >
      The same team that designed Mindspark also carried out the trial and analysis,
      so the Independent Conduct criterion is not satisfied.

      1) "We measure program impacts ... after the 4.5‑month‑long intervention."
      (p. 3) 

      2) No follow‑up beyond February 2016 is reported.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Tracking lasted only 4.5 months, far short of a full academic year.
      The Year Duration criterion thus is not met.

      Therefore, criterion Y is not met because participants were only tracked for
      4.5 months, not a full academic year.
    explanation: >
      Participants were followed for only 4.5 months rather than an academic year,
      so the Year Duration criterion is not satisfied.

      1) "The centers scheduled 6 days of instruction per week, for 90 minutes per
      day." (p. 7) 

      2) "Students not chosen by lottery ... did not have access to the Mindspark
      program." (p. 9) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The additional instructional time is the core treatment being tested. Under 
      the Balanced Resources criterion, when extra resources are integral to the
      intervention, the control may remain business‑as‑usual. Here, the extra time
      is part of the treatment design, so the criterion is met.

      Therefore, criterion B is met because the extra instructional time is integral
      to the intervention.
    explanation: >
      The intervention’s extra instructional time is integral to the treatment, so 
      the Balanced Resources criterion is satisfied.

      None found regarding independent replication.

      Detailed Analysis:

      No external replication is reported in the paper. Therefore, the Reproduced
      criterion is not met.

      Therefore, criterion R is not met because no independent replication of the
      study has been documented.
    explanation: >
      No independent replication of the study is reported, so the Reproduced 
      criterion is not satisfied.

      and Hindi." (p. 3) 

      2) "Scheduled daily instruction ... provided activities on math, Hindi, and
      English one day a week." (p. 7) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Assessment was limited to mathematics and Hindi; core subjects beyond these
      were not evaluated. The All‑subject Exams criterion thus is not met.

      Therefore, criterion A is not met because only two core subjects were assessed.
    explanation: >
      Only mathematics and Hindi were assessed, so the All‑subject Exams criterion
      is not satisfied.

      (p. 5) 

      2) No further follow‑up is described.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study ends at the endline test and does not track participants through
      graduation. Thus, the Graduation Tracking criterion is not met.

      Therefore, criterion G is not met because participants were not tracked
      through graduation.
    explanation: >
      Participants were only followed until the endline test, with no graduation
      tracking, so the Graduation Tracking criterion is not satisfied.

      1) "The study was registered with the AEA Trial Registry (RCT ID AEARCTR‑0000980)."
      (p. 1 footnote) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study was registered in the AEA trial registry on April 27, 2016, which was
      after the start of the experiment in 2015. Because registration occurred only
      after data collection had begun, the Pre‑registered Protocol criterion is not met.

      Therefore, criterion P is not met because the trial was registered only after
      data collection had started.
    explanation: >
      The trial was registered only after data collection began, so the Pre‑registered
      Protocol criterion is not satisfied.
