abstract: >-
  We study the impact of a personalized technology-aided after-school
  instruction program in middle-school grades in urban India using a
  lottery that provided winners with free access to the program. Lottery
  winners scored 0.37σ higher in math and 0.23σ higher in Hindi over just
  a 4.5-month period. IV estimates suggest that attending the program for
  90 days would increase math and Hindi test scores by 0.6σ and 0.39σ
  respectively. We find similar absolute test score gains for all students,
  but much greater relative gains for academically-weaker students. Our
  results suggest that well-designed, technology-aided instruction programs
  can sharply improve productivity in delivering education.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The 619 participants were individually randomized into treatment
      and control groups with 305 students in the control and 314 in the
      treatment group." (p. 1434)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires that the intervention is tested at the
      classroom level to prevent cross-group contamination. However, in this
      study, randomization was conducted at the individual student level
      within schools, not at the class level. The quote indicates that
      students were individually assigned to treatment or control, which
      could lead to contamination if students in the same class interact.
      This approach does not meet the requirement for class-level
      randomization as specified by criterion C.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is not met because the randomization was
      at the individual student level, not at the class level.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The tests were designed independently by the research team and
      intended to capture a wide range of student achievement." (p. 1436)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires the use of standardized exams for
      assessment, meaning widely recognized tests not specifically designed
      for the study. The quote shows that the tests in this study were
      custom-made by the research team to measure a broad range of
      achievement in math and Hindi. There is no indication that these tests
      are standardized exams used broadly outside this study. Thus, this
      criterion is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because the study used
      custom-made tests rather than standardized exams.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "after the 4.5-month-long intervention" (p. 1428)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires the intervention to last at least one full
      academic term, typically 3-4 months. The paper states the intervention
      lasted 4.5 months, which exceeds the minimum duration of a typical
      academic term. This duration aligns with the criterion's intent to
      measure meaningful impacts over a substantial period.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is met because the intervention lasted 4.5
      months, exceeding the minimum term duration requirement.
    quote: >

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Table 1—Sample Descriptives and Balance on Observables" (p. 1435)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires detailed documentation of the control
      group, including demographics, baseline performance, and treatments
      received. The paper provides Table 1, which details the control group's
      characteristics such as gender, age, socioeconomic status, and
      baseline test scores, ensuring comparability with the treatment group.
      The control group received no intervention during the study period,
      which is also documented. This satisfies the criterion.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the study provides detailed
      documentation of the control group's characteristics and baseline
      performance.
    quote: >
      "Table 1—Sample Descriptives and Balance on Observables" (p. 1435)

      and control groups with 305 students in the control and 314 in the
      treatment group." (p. 1434)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires randomization at the school level for
      criterion S. The paper indicates that randomization occurred at the
      individual student level within schools, not across entire schools.
      This approach does not meet the school-level randomization
      requirement.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met because the randomization was
      at the individual student level, not at the school level.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We measure program impacts using independently conducted
      paper-and-pencil tests of student learning in math and Hindi"
      (p. 1428)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires measurement of impact across all main
      subjects taught in the school. This study only assessed math and Hindi,
      not all core subjects (e.g., science, social studies). Furthermore,
      since criterion E (standardized exams) is not met, criterion A cannot
      be met either, as per the standard's dependency rule.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because the study only measured
      math and Hindi, not all main subjects, and criterion E is not met.

      1) "after the 4.5-month-long intervention" (p. 1428)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires the intervention to last at least one full
      academic year (typically 9-10 months). The intervention lasted 4.5
      months, which is less than a full academic year. Thus, this criterion
      is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because the intervention lasted
      only 4.5 months, not a full academic year.
    quote: >

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Lottery losers were not allowed to access the program during the
      study period." (p. 1434)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires the control group to receive equal time and
      resources as the treatment group unless the additional resources are
      the treatment variable. The treatment group received 90 minutes of
      after-school instruction 6 days per week, while the control group
      received no equivalent additional time or resources, only standard
      schooling. The study does not explicitly test extra time as the
      treatment variable; rather, it evaluates the technology-aided program.
      This imbalance means criterion B is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is not met because the control group did
      not receive equivalent time or resources.
    quote: >
      "Lottery losers were not allowed to access the program during the

      failing the balanced control group requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "after the 4.5-month-long intervention" (p. 1428)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires tracking participants until graduation to
      assess long-term impacts. The study only followed students for 4.5
      months with no mention of tracking until graduation from middle
      school or beyond. Thus, criterion G is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because the study did not track
      participants until graduation.
    quote: null
    explanation: >
      The study did not track participants until graduation, failing the
      graduation tracking requirement. No follow-up research has been
      conducted to track these students through graduation.

      Relevant Quotes:

      None found.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires independent replication by a different
      research team. The paper does not mention any such replication, and
      no external studies are cited as reproducing this specific
      intervention. Thus, criterion R is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because there is no evidence of
      independent replication.
    quote: null
    explanation: >
      There is no evidence of independent replication, failing the
      reproduction requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We thank the staff at Educational Initiatives (EI), especially,
      Pranav Kothari, Smita Bardhan, Anurima Chatterjee, and Prasid
      Sreeprakash, for their support of the evaluation." (p. 1426)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires the study to be conducted independently
      from the intervention designers. The authors collaborated with
      Educational Initiatives (EI), the developer of Mindspark, and there is
      no mention of an independent third party conducting the study. This
      close involvement indicates a lack of independence, so criterion I is
      not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because the study was not
      conducted independently from the intervention designers.

      1) "The study was registered with the AEA Trial Registry (RCT ID
      AEARCTR-0000980)." (p. 1426)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires pre-registration of the full study protocol
      before data collection begins. The study was registered in the AEA
      RCT Registry (RCT ID AEARCTR-0000980), but the registration occurred
      on April 27, 2016—after the baseline (September 2015) and endline
      (February 2016) data collection. Therefore, the study was not
      pre-registered before data collection began,
      and criterion P is not met.

      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met because the study was not
      pre-registered before data collection began.

    explanation: >
      The trial was registered only after data collection had begun,
      failing the pre-registration requirement.
