abstract: >-
  Tutoring programs for low-performing students, delivered in-person or online,
  effectively enhance school performance, yet their medium- and longer-term
  impacts on labor market outcomes remain less understood. To address this gap,
  we conduct a randomized controlled trial with 839 secondary school students in
  Germany to examine the effects of an online tutoring program for low-performing
  students on academic performance and school-to-work transitions. The online
  tutoring program had a non-significant intention-to-treat effect of 0.06
  standard deviations on math grades six months after program start. However,
  among students who had not received other tutoring services prior to the
  intervention, the program significantly improved math grades by 0.14 standard
  deviations. Moreover, students in non-academic school tracks experienced
  smoother school-to-work transitions, with vocational training take-up 18 months
  later being 5 percentage points higher-an effect that was even larger (12
  percentage points) among those without prior tutoring. Overall, the results
  indicate that tutoring can generate lasting benefits for low-performing
  students that extend beyond school performance.

    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Student-level randomization is acceptable because the intervention is
      one-to-one tutoring.
    quote: >-
      "This paper investigates the effects of a one-on-one online tutoring
      program in Germany on both academic performance and school-to-work
      transitions." (p. 2)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This paper investigates the effects of a one-on-one online tutoring
      program in Germany on both academic performance and school-to-work
      transitions." (p. 2)

      2) "The students were then pair-wise randomly assigned to either a
      treatment or a control group." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C normally requires class-level (or school-level) randomization,
      but the ERCT standard provides an explicit exception for personal tutoring
      or one-to-one teaching. The paper states the intervention is "one-on-one
      online tutoring" and then describes student-level randomization ("pair-wise
      randomly assigned").

      Under the ERCT tutoring exception, student-level randomization is
      acceptable because contamination within a classroom is not the core risk
      for a one-to-one tutoring offer.

      Criterion C is met because this is a one-to-one tutoring intervention and
      randomization is clearly described.

      Outcomes rely on self-reported grades rather than standardized exam-based
      assessments.
    quote: >-
      "All grades are self-reported by the young participants and relate to the
      final grades from school years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023, respectively."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "All grades are self-reported by the young participants and relate to
      the final grades from school years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023, respectively."
      (p. 22)

      2) "As German data restrictions did not allow us to obtain grades from
      administrative sources, we cannot test the reliability of the students'
      self-reports using an external source." (p. 41)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized exam-based assessments that are widely
      recognized and not bespoke to the study. The paper measures academic
      outcomes using school grades, but explicitly notes these grades are
      self-reported and that administrative grade records could not be obtained.

      Self-reported grades are not the same as standardized, externally
      administered exam measures, and they also introduce additional reporting
      noise and potential bias.

      Criterion E is not met because outcomes are not based on standardized
      exam-based assessments.

    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The first follow-up occurs about six months after randomization, exceeding
      one academic term.
    quote: >-
      "After randomization, we conducted two follow-up surveys. The first, six
      months after randomization, coincided with the start of the new school
      year; the second took place around 18 months later." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "After randomization, we conducted two follow-up surveys. The first, six
      months after randomization, coincided with the start of the new school
      year; the second took place around 18 months later." (p. 3)

      2) "The first survey (follow-up I) took place in October and November
      2022, during the new school year, after the treatment group had been
      invited to participate in Lern-Fair." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that outcomes are measured at least one academic term
      (about 3-4 months) after the intervention begins. The paper explicitly
      states the first follow-up is "six months after randomization" and places
      it in Oct-Nov 2022 after the invitation.

      Six months is comfortably longer than one term, so the timing requirement
      is satisfied.

      Criterion T is met because the first outcome measurement is about six
      months after randomization.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The paper clearly describes the control condition and reports baseline
      balance between groups.
    quote: >-
      "Students randomized into the control group received neither targeted
      information about the free online tutoring offered by Lern-Fair, nor easy
      and preferential access to the online tutoring program." (p. 12)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students randomized into the control group received neither targeted
      information about the free online tutoring offered by Lern-Fair, nor easy
      and preferential access to the online tutoring program." (p. 12)

      2) "Table 1: Balance test" (p. 13)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires a well-documented control group, including what the
      control group received and evidence that groups are comparable at baseline.
      The paper explicitly defines the control group as receiving no targeted
      information and no preferential access to the program. It also provides a
      baseline balance table (Table 1) comparing treatment and control on
      sociodemographic and school-related variables.

      This combination provides both a clear control condition and baseline
      comparability documentation.

      Criterion D is met because the control condition and baseline balance are
      documented.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization occurred at the student level, not at the school level.
    quote: >-

      or a control group." (p. 11)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The students were then pair-wise randomly assigned to either a
      treatment or a control group." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level randomization (assignment among schools
      or equivalent institutions). The paper describes pair-wise randomization of
      students within the study sample, not assignment of schools.

      Therefore, the unit of randomization does not satisfy the school-level RCT
      requirement.

      Criterion S is not met because randomization is not conducted at the school
      level.
  i:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The tutoring program is run by an external nonprofit, while the evaluation
      is conducted by academic researchers.
    quote: >-
      "The nonprofit organization Lern-Fair provides the online tutoring
      evaluated in this study." (p. 7)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The nonprofit organization Lern-Fair provides the online tutoring
      evaluated in this study." (p. 7)

      2) "The program, operated by the nonprofit organization Lern-Fair, uses a
      web-based platform to connect university student volunteers with
      disadvantaged secondary school students in need of academic support."
      (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the evaluation is conducted independently of the
      intervention designer/operator. The paper states Lern-Fair (a nonprofit)
      provides and operates the tutoring program. The study is written by
      university and research-institute affiliated authors, indicating the
      evaluators are not the program operator.

      The paper also acknowledges help from Lern-Fair members, consistent with
      an external provider supporting implementation while researchers evaluate.

      Criterion I is met because the program is operated by Lern-Fair and the
      evaluation is conducted by external academic researchers.
  y:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes are tracked from early 2022 to late 2023, exceeding one academic
      year.
    quote: >-
      "The second survey (follow-up II) took place in November and December
      2023." (p. 14)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Our baseline survey, which was part of the CoDu panel survey, took
      place between February and March 2022..." (p. 11)

      2) "The second survey (follow-up II) took place in November and December
      2023." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least one full academic year
      after the intervention begins. The study baseline and randomization occur
      in Feb-Mar 2022, and follow-up II occurs in Nov-Dec 2023, a span of roughly
      20-22 months. This exceeds a full academic year in any standard school
      calendar.

      Criterion Y is met because follow-up II is conducted well beyond one year
      after baseline/randomization.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Any additional resources (free tutoring access) are the treatment variable,
      so a business-as-usual control is acceptable under ERCT.
    quote: >-
      "Students randomized into the control group received neither targeted
      information about the free online tutoring offered by Lern-Fair, nor easy
      and preferential access to the online tutoring program." (p. 12)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Students assigned to the treatment group received an invitation to
      participate in the Lern-Fair online tutoring program." (p. 11)

      2) "Students randomized into the control group received neither targeted
      information about the free online tutoring offered by Lern-Fair, nor easy
      and preferential access to the online tutoring program." (p. 12)

      3) "This paper investigates the effects of a one-on-one online tutoring
      program in Germany on both academic performance and school-to-work
      transitions." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B checks whether intervention and control conditions are balanced
      in time and resources, unless the additional resources are explicitly the
      treatment variable being tested. Here, the core treatment is access to
      free, one-to-one online tutoring (an additional educational resource). The
      study's stated purpose is to estimate the effects of the tutoring offer,
      and the control group is intentionally not given targeted information or
      preferential access.

      This fits the ERCT exception case: the additional resource (tutoring) is
      the intervention being evaluated, and the control group is business as
      usual by design.

      Criterion B is met because the resource difference is the explicit
      treatment variable being tested.

      No independent replication of this specific Lern-Fair RCT by another team
      was found.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Our study is the first to extend this research by exploring the impact
      of tutoring on labor market transitions..." (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires independent replication by other authors in another
      context, published in a peer-reviewed journal. The paper positions itself
      as a first contribution on labor-market transitions in this tutoring
      context, and it does not report a replication of this specific RCT.

      A targeted literature search did not identify a separate study by an
      independent team that explicitly reproduces this specific Lern-Fair RCT
      design and cohort.

      Criterion R is not met because no independent replication of this study was
      found.

    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Criterion E is not met, so Criterion A is automatically not met.
    quote: >-
      "All grades are self-reported by the young participants..." (p. 22)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "All grades are self-reported by the young participants and relate to
      the final grades from school years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023, respectively."
      (p. 22)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based assessment across all main
      subjects, and the ERCT rules state that if Criterion E is not met then
      Criterion A is not met as well. Since outcomes are based on self-reported
      grades rather than standardized exams, the prerequisite fails.

      Criterion A is not met because Criterion E is not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study follows participants for about 18 months, not until graduation,
      and no follow-up graduation-tracking paper was found.
    quote: >-
      "After randomization, we conducted two follow-up surveys... the second
      took place around 18 months later." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "After randomization, we conducted two follow-up surveys. The first, six
      months after randomization, coincided with the start of the new school
      year; the second took place around 18 months later." (p. 3)

      2) "While life cycle outcomes-such as long-term wages and employment in
      adulthood-remain beyond the scope of this study..." (p. 42)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation from the
      relevant educational stage. The paper explicitly describes follow-up only
      through about 18 months post-randomization, and it also notes that longer
      life-cycle outcomes are beyond scope. Although follow-up II captures an
      important transition point for some students, it does not constitute
      tracking the cohort through graduation.

      A targeted search for subsequent papers by the same author team that track
      this cohort through graduation did not identify any publicly available
      graduation-tracking follow-up.

      Criterion G is not met because the study does not track participants until
      graduation and no graduation follow-up paper was found.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study cites an AEA RCT Registry ID but no publicly accessible record
      with the registration date could be retrieved to verify pre-registration
      timing.
    quote: >-
      "The experiment was preregistered in the AEA RCT registry, AEARCTR-0008937."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The experiment was preregistered in the AEA RCT registry,
      AEARCTR-0008937." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires verifying that the protocol was registered before the
      study began (registration date must precede trial start / data collection).
      The paper provides the registry identifier (AEARCTR-0008937), which is
      evidence of a registry entry, but the paper itself does not state the
      registry registration date.

      A targeted attempt to retrieve the public registry record and its
      registration date did not yield an accessible public page with the needed
      date information. Without a verifiable registration date, the ERCT rule for
      confirming pre-registration timing cannot be satisfied.

      Criterion P is not met because the registration date could not be verified
      as preceding the study start.
