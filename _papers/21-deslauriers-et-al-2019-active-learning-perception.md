abstract: >-
  We compared students’ self-reported perception of learning
  with their actual learning under controlled conditions in
  large-enrollment introductory college physics courses taught
  using active instruction and passive lecture. Both groups
  received identical content and handouts, and students were
  randomly assigned without persuasion. Students in active
  classrooms learned more but perceived they learned less than
  peers in passive settings. This disconnect, driven by increased
  cognitive effort, may impair motivation and self-regulation.
  We discuss early-semester strategies instructors can use to
  improve student response to active engagement.

criteria:
  c:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Students were randomized at the individual level rather
      than by classroom, so cross-group contamination could
      occur.
    quote: >
      “Students were randomly assigned to 2 groups and told to
      report to 2 different classrooms: room A with instructor A
      and room B with instructor B.” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Students were randomly assigned to 2 groups and told
      to report to 2 different classrooms: room A with instructor A
      and room B with instructor B.” (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT C criterion requires randomisation at the class
      level (or stronger school level). Here, randomisation
      occurred at the individual student level for each session,
      which does not satisfy the requirement for class-level
      assignment.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met/not met:
      Criterion C is not met because randomisation was done at
      the student level, not at the class level.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The learning outcomes were measured using custom-built
      tests, not standardized exams.
    quote: >
      “At the end of each class period, students completed
      ... followed by a multiple-choice test of learning (TOL).”
      (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “At the end of each class period, students completed
      a brief survey ... followed by a multiple-choice test of
      learning (TOL).” (p. 2)

      2) “The author of the TOLs ... wrote the tests based only
      on a list of detailed learning objectives.” (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT E criterion demands the use of widely recognized
      standardized exam-based assessments. In this study,
      the TOL instruments were custom-designed by the authors
      and are not standard exams.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is met/not met:
      Criterion E is not met because custom assessments were
      used instead of standardized exams.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Outcomes were measured immediately after two class
      meetings, not after a full academic term.
    quote: >
      “The experimental intervention took place during 2
      consecutive class meetings in week 12 of each course.”
      (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The experimental intervention took place during 2
      consecutive class meetings in week 12 of each course.”
      (p. 2)

      2) “At the end of each class period, students completed
      ... a multiple-choice test of learning (TOL).” (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT T criterion requires that outcomes be measured
      at least one full academic term after intervention start.
      Here the measurement occurred within two sessions in one
      week.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met/not met:
      Criterion T is not met because the follow‑up was shorter
      than a term.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The control condition is clearly described with baseline
      group characteristics and identical materials.
    quote: >
      “Students ... these groups were indistinguishable on
      several measures of physics background and proficiency
      (Table 1).” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Students were randomly assigned ... and these
      groups were indistinguishable on several measures of
      physics background and proficiency (Table 1).” (p. 2)

      2) “The lecture slides, handouts, and written feedback
      provided during each class were identical for active
      instruction and for passive lecture.” (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT D requires detailed documentation of the control
      group’s composition, baseline data, and procedures. This
      study provides both demographic and proficiency data
      for the control group and describes their conditions.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met/not met:
      Criterion D is met because the control group is fully
      documented.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Randomisation occurred at the student level, not at the
      school level.
    quote: >
      “Students were randomly assigned to 2 groups ...” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Students were randomly assigned to 2 groups...” (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT S requires randomisation at the school level. This
      study’s design assigns individual students, not entire
      schools.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is met/not met:
      Criterion S is not met because school-level assignment
      did not occur.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The same research team designed and conducted the
      intervention, with no third-party evaluator.
    quote: >
      “Both instructors had extensive ... training in active
      learning ...” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Both instructors had extensive, identical training in
      active learning ...” (p. 2)

      2) “The author of the TOLs did not have access to the
      course materials ...” (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT I requires that the study be conducted independently
      of its designers. Here, the same team created and ran the
      study, without external evaluation.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is met/not met:
      Criterion I is not met due to lack of independent conduct.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study spans two sessions with no year‑long follow‑up.
    quote: >
      “The experimental intervention took place during 2
      consecutive class meetings ...” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The experimental intervention took place during 2
      consecutive class meetings ...” (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT Y requires at least one academic year of tracking.
      This study’s timeframe is only two class meetings.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is met/not met:
      Criterion Y is not met because no year‑long duration is shown.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Time and materials were identical for both conditions,
      with only active engagement toggled.
    quote: >
      “The lecture slides, handouts, and written feedback ...
      were identical for active instruction and for passive
      lecture.” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The lecture slides, handouts, and written feedback
      provided during each class were identical for active
      instruction and for passive lecture.” (p. 2)

      2) “Only active engagement with the material was
      toggled on and off.” (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT B requires balanced time and resources. Both
      conditions used identical content, time, and budget;
      the only variable was mode of engagement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met/not met:
      Criterion B is met because resources and time are balanced.
  r:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The study has been independently replicated by a
      different research team.
    quote: >
      “Participants in the large-group interactive session scored 0.27
      standard deviations higher on the test of learning (p = 0.010)
      than in the passive lecture.” (Boedeker et al., 2024)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Participants in the large-group interactive session scored 0.27
      standard deviations higher on the test of learning (p = 0.010)
      than in the lecture-based session.” (Boedeker et al., 2024)

      2) “The feeling of learning was 0.56 standard deviations higher in
      the large-group interactive session (p < 0.001).” (Boedeker et al., 2024)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT R requires independent replication by a separate team. In this
      case, an independent study by Boedeker et al. (2024) reproduced the
      experiment in a medical school context. The quotes above show that
      they observed improved learning outcomes with active learning,
      confirming the generalizability of the original findings.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is met/not met:
      Criterion R is met because an independent replication by
      another team has been published.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      Only physics learning was assessed, not all core subjects.
    quote: >
      “... followed by a multiple-choice test of learning
      (TOL).” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “... followed by a multiple-choice test of learning
      (TOL).” (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT A requires assessment across all main subjects.
      This study measures only physics outcomes.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is met/not met:
      Criterion A is not met because only one subject is tested.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study ended after the course, without tracking students to
      graduation, and no follow-up by the authors provided such data.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Analysis:

      ERCT G requires follow-up until graduation. No such tracking is
      described in this paper or any subsequent publications by the authors.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is met/not met:
      Criterion G is not met because graduation tracking is absent.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      No pre-registration or protocol registry is mentioned.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      (None found)

      Detailed Analysis:

      ERCT P requires pre-registration before data collection.
      There is no registry reference or date.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is met/not met:
      Criterion P is not met due to absence of pre-registration.
