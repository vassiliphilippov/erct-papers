abstract: >-
  We compared students’ self-reported perception of learning with
  their actual learning under controlled conditions in large-
  enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1)
  active instruction (following best practices in the discipline)
  and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly
  rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content
  and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor
  made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either
  method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be
  expected based on prior research), but their perception of
  learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in
  passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate
  instruction based on students’ perceptions of learning could
  inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods.
  For instance, a superstar lecturer could create such a positive
  feeling of learning that students would choose those lectures
  over active learning. Most importantly, these results suggest
  that when students experience the increased cognitive effort
  associated with active learning, they initially take that effort
  to signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a
  detrimental effect on students’ motivation, engagement, and
  ability to self-regulate their own learning. Although students
  can, on their own, discover the increased value of being actively
  engaged during a semester-long course, their learning may be
  impaired during the initial part of the course. We discuss
  strategies that instructors can use, early in the semester, to
  improve students’ response to being actively engaged in the
  classroom.

    explanation: >
      The study randomized individual students to groups rather than
      randomizing entire classes.
    quote: >
      "Students were individually randomly assigned to 2 groups, and
      these groups were indistinguishable on several measures of
      physics background and proficiency."

      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "Students were randomly assigned to 2 groups and told to
      report to 2 different classrooms: room A with instructor A and
      room B with instructor B." (p. 3)
      
      2) "Students were individually randomly assigned to 2 groups,
      and these groups were indistinguishable on several measures of
      physics background and proficiency." (p. 3)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT standard requires that the intervention is tested at
      the classroom level, meaning that entire pre-existing classes
      should be randomized to conditions to prevent cross-group
      contamination. In this study, students were individually
      randomized to groups, and each group was then taught in a
      separate classroom. This is student-level randomization with
      clustering by classroom, not class-level randomization. The
      quote "Students were individually randomly assigned" clearly
      indicates that the randomization occurred at the student level.
      Although each group was taught in a separate classroom, the
      classes were formed by the random assignment of students
      rather than randomizing pre-existing classes. The standard
      specifies that "randomisation should occur among classes, not
      just students within classes," and an example in the thinking
      trace confirms that student-level randomization does not meet
      this criterion.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion C is not met because the
      randomization was at the student level, not at the class level.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study used custom-made multiple-choice tests, not
      standardized exams.
    quote: >
      "The subsequent tests of learning (1 on statics and 1 on
      fluids) each consisted of 12 multiple-choice questions."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "At the end of each class period, students completed a
      brief survey about their perceptions of the class and their
      FOL, followed by a multiple-choice test of learning (TOL)."
      (p. 3)
      
      2) "The subsequent tests of learning (1 on statics and 1 on
      fluids) each consisted of 12 multiple-choice questions."
      (p. 3)
      
      3) "The instructors did not see the TOLs, which were prepared
      independently by another author. 9) The author of the TOLs
      did not have access to the course materials or lecture slides
      and wrote the tests based only on a list of detailed learning
      objectives for each topic." (p. 3)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT standard requires the use of standardized exams that
      are widely recognized and not specifically designed for the
      study. The tests of learning (TOLs) in this study were 12-
      question multiple-choice tests created by one of the authors
      based on the learning objectives of the topics taught (static
      equilibrium and fluids). While the tests were prepared
      independently of the instructors and course materials to
      reduce bias, there is no indication that they are standardized
      exams used across institutions or recognized beyond this
      study. The description suggests they were custom-made for
      this research, which does not meet the criterion's
      requirement.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because the
      assessments were custom-made, not standardized exams.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The intervention lasted only two class meetings, not a full
      academic term.
    quote: >
      "The experimental intervention took place during 2
      consecutive class meetings in week 12 of each course."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "The experimental intervention took place during 2
      consecutive class meetings in week 12 of each course."
      (p. 3)
      
      2) "Classes meet for 90 min twice each week, during a
      semester lasting 15 wk." (p. 3)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT standard requires that the intervention lasts at
      least one full academic term, typically 3-4 months. The paper
      states that the intervention occurred over two consecutive
      class meetings in week 12, with each meeting lasting 90
      minutes. This totals 3 hours of intervention time, which is
      significantly less than a semester (15 weeks in this case).
      The intervention's brevity—only two days—does not align with
      the standard's requirement for a term-long duration to
      measure meaningful impacts.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion T is not met because the
      intervention duration was only two days, not a full term.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      The study provides detailed documentation of the control
      group, including baseline characteristics and conditions.
    quote: >
      "Both groups received identical class content and handouts,
      students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no
      effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method."

      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "Both groups received identical class content and
      handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor
      made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either
      method." (p. 1)
      
      2) "The entire protocol was repeated twice in physics
      courses taught during fall and spring at Harvard University.
      These calculus-based introductory courses cover topics in

      3) "Table 1. Descriptive statistics for the randomized
      groups used in the study" (p. 4)
      
      4) "Students were individually randomly assigned to 2
      groups, and these groups were indistinguishable on several
      measures of physics background and proficiency (Table 1)."
      (p. 3)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT standard requires detailed control group data,
      including demographics, baseline performance, and
      conditions. This study uses a crossover design where each
      student experienced both active and passive instruction, but
      for analysis, the passive condition serves as the control.
      The paper provides Table 1 with descriptive statistics
      (e.g., FCI scores, CLASS scores, midterm averages) showing
      that the two groups were similar at baseline. The conditions
      are detailed: both groups received identical content and
      handouts, with the only difference being the instructional
      method (active vs. passive). The control condition (passive
      lecture) is clearly described, and baseline comparability is
      documented, meeting the criterion's requirements.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion D is met because the control group
      is thoroughly documented with baseline data and conditions.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study was conducted within a single university, not
      across multiple schools.
    quote: >
      "The entire protocol was repeated twice in physics courses

      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "The entire protocol was repeated twice in physics
      courses taught during fall and spring at Harvard
      University." (p. 3)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT standard requires randomization at the school
      level, with multiple schools involved. This study was
      conducted solely at Harvard University within two physics
      courses. There is no mention of multiple schools or
      randomization across institutions; instead, it involves
      student-level randomization within a single university.
      This does not meet the criterion for a school-level RCT.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met because the study was
      not conducted at the school level with randomization among
      schools.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study assessed only physics topics, not all core
      subjects.
    quote: >
      "The subsequent tests of learning (1 on statics and 1 on
      fluids) each consisted of 12 multiple-choice questions."

      2) "These calculus-based introductory courses cover topics
      in mechanics at a level appropriate for physics majors."
      (p. 3)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT standard requires assessment across all core
      subjects to avoid imbalances. The study’s tests of learning
      focused solely on physics topics—static equilibrium and
      fluids—within introductory physics courses. No other
      subjects (e.g., math, language arts) were assessed.
      Additionally, since criterion E (standardized exams) is not
      met, criterion A cannot be met per the instructions.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met because the study
      assessed only physics topics, not all core subjects.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The intervention lasted only two class meetings, not a full
      academic year.

      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "The experimental intervention took place during 2
      consecutive class meetings in week 12 of each course."
      (p. 3)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT standard requires the intervention to last at
      least one full academic year. The intervention here spanned
      only two 90-minute class meetings, totaling 3 hours. This
      is far shorter than a year (typically 9-10 months). Since
      criterion T (term duration) is not met, criterion Y cannot
      be met per the instructions.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because the
      intervention did not last a full academic year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Both groups received identical class content, handouts, and
      time, ensuring balanced resources.
    quote: >
      "Both groups received identical class content and handouts,
      students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no
      effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "Both groups received identical class content and
      handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the
      instructor made no effort to persuade students of the
      benefit of either method." (p. 1)
      
      2) "The lecture slides, handouts, and written feedback
      provided during each class were identical for active
      instruction and for passive lecture." (p. 3)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT standard requires that both groups receive equal
      time and resources to isolate the intervention’s effect. In
      this crossover design, each student experienced both active
      and passive conditions, with the passive serving as the
      control. The paper states that both groups received
      identical content, handouts, and feedback, with each class
      meeting lasting 90 minutes. The only difference was the
      instructional method (active engagement vs. passive
      lecture), not the resources or time. This balance meets the
      criterion’s requirements.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion B is met because both groups had
      equal time and resources.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study did not track students until graduation; outcomes
      were measured immediately after the intervention.

      (p. 3)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT standard requires tracking students until
      graduation to assess long-term impacts. In this study,
      outcomes were collected only immediately after each class
      session&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, with no further follow-up by the
      researchers. No subsequent publications by the authors were
      found that track these students to graduation. Since
      criterion Y (year duration) is not met, criterion G cannot
      be met per the instructions.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met because there was no
      tracking of students until graduation.

      Relevant Quotes:
      
      None found.
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT standard requires that the study be independently
      replicated by a different research team. To date, we found
      no evidence of any such independent replication. The paper
      has generated discussion in the academic community,
      but no other researchers have published
      a reproduction of these findings. Without evidence of
      independent replication, this criterion is not met.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion R is not met because the study
      has not been independently replicated.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study was conducted by the authors themselves, not by
      an independent third party.

      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "The authors declare no conflict of interest." (p. 1)
      
      2) "Author contributions: L.D., L.S.M., and K.C. designed

      L.S.M., K.M., and G.K. wrote the paper." (p. 1)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT standard requires the study to be conducted by
      third-party evaluators to reduce bias. The author
      contributions section indicates that the same team
      designed, performed, and analyzed the research, all
      affiliated with Harvard University where the study took
      place. There is no mention of an independent evaluation
      team, and the declaration of no conflict of interest does
      not address independence. This lack of third-party
      involvement means the criterion is not met.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met because the study
      was not conducted by an independent third party.

      Detailed Analysis:
      
      The ERCT standard requires the study protocol to be pre-
      registered before data collection to enhance transparency. 
      We searched for a pre-registered protocol for this study on
      platforms like the OSF and found no record of one. The paper
      itself contains no reference to any pre-registration or
      registry entry. Without this information, the criterion is
      not met.
      
      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met because the study
      protocol was not pre-registered.
