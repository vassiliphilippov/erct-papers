  Many school-based interventions are being delivered in the absence of evidence 
  of effectiveness. This study sought to address this oversight by evaluating 
  the effectiveness of the commonly used the Lexia Reading Core5 intervention,
  with 4- to 6-year-old pupils in Northern Ireland. A total of 126 primary school 
  pupils in year 1 and year 2 were screened on the Phonological Assessment Battery 
  2nd Edition (PhAB-2). Children were recruited from the equivalent year groups to 
  Reception and Year 1 in England and Wales, and Pre-kindergarten and 
  Kindergarten in North America. A total of 98 below-average pupils were 
  randomized (T0) to either an 8-week block of daily access to Lexia Reading Core5 
  (n = 49) or a waiting-list control group (n = 49). Assessment of phonological 
  skills was completed at post-intervention (T1) and at 2-month follow-up (T2) 
  for the intervention group only.
  Analysis of covariance which controlled for baseline scores found that the 
  Lexia Reading Core5 intervention group made significantly greater gains in 
  blending, F(1, 95) = 6.50, p = .012, partial η2 = .064 (small effect size) 
  and non-word reading, F(1, 95) = 7.20, p = .009, partial η2 = .070 (small effect size). 
  Analysis of the 2-month follow-up of the intervention group found that all group 
  treatment gains were maintained. However, improvements were not uniform among 
  the intervention group with 35% failing to make progress despite access to 
  support. Post-hoc analysis revealed that higher T0 phonological working 
  memory scores predicted improvements made in phonological skills.
  Conclusion: An early-intervention, computer-based literacy program can be 
  effective in boosting the phonological skills of 4- to 6-year-olds, 
  particularly if these literacy difficulties are not linked to phonological 
  working memory deficits.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They randomized at the pupil level in an individually delivered
      intervention, which fits the personal-tutoring exception to
      class-level randomization.
    quote: >-
      "A total of 98 below-average pupils were randomized…
      The intervention group received daily, individual, adult-supervised…
      20- to 30-min blocks of computer-based support." (p. 548, 551)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      1) “A total of 98 below-average pupils were randomized (T0) to either an
      8-week block of daily access to Lexia Reading Core5 (n = 49) or a
      waiting-list control group (n = 49).” (p. 548)
      
      2) “This was a parallel-group, RCT with a no-treatment, wait-list control
      group.” (p. 549)
      
      3) “The intervention group received daily, individual, adult-supervised, 20-
      to 30-min blocks of computer-based support…” (p. 551)
      
      In examining Criterion C, the paper randomized pupils individually with an
      exception for personal tutoring. Thus, C is met.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They employed PhAB-2, a standardized, normed, and recognized battery,
      rather than an in-house test.
    quote: >-
      "The PhAB-2 was chosen … it was recently standardized … it provides
      standardized scores…." (p. 550)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      1) “To assess phonological skills the Phonological Assessment Battery
      Second Edition (PhAB-2) [was used].” (p. 550)
      
      2) “The PhAB-2 was chosen because it … provides standardized scores … and
      it contains a standardized protocol for both test administration and scoring.”
      (p. 550)
      
      Therefore, Criterion E is met.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The active intervention period lasted only about 8 weeks, which falls
      short of a full academic term.
    quote: >-
      "…an 8-week block of daily access to Lexia Reading Core5…" (p. 548)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      1) “A total of 98 below-average pupils were randomized … to either an 8-
      week block (x̄ = 647.51 min, SD = 158.21) of daily access to Lexia Reading
      Core5 … or a waiting-list control group.” (p. 548)
      
      2) “The study ran from December 2014 to June 2015. … The intervention group
      received one block of intervention support [for 8 weeks].” (p. 549, 551)
      
      Since 8 weeks is under the typical term duration, T is not met.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They present clear demographic and baseline data for the control group
      and describe its ‘business-as-usual’ instruction.
    quote: >-
      "Baseline characteristics of participants in the two groups are presented in
      Table 1… The wait-list control group received standard classroom teaching …
      supplemented with phonics." (pp. 549–550)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      1) “A total of 98 below-average pupils were randomized … to either an 8-
      week block… or a waiting-list control group (n = 49). Assessment was
      completed at post-intervention (T1) and at 2-month follow-up (T2) for the
      intervention group only.” (p. 548)
      
      2) “Baseline characteristics of participants in the two groups are presented
      in Table 1 … Randomization resulted in no significant difference on age,
      gender, year group…” (p. 550)
      
      3) “The wait-list control group … received standard classroom teaching in
      line with the statutory Northern Irish curriculum … supplemented with both
      synthetic and linguistic phonics.” (p. 549)
      
      Therefore, D is met.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Random assignment was performed at the pupil level, not by school.
    quote: >-
      "A total of 98 below-average pupils were randomized…
      The study took place in two town-based primary schools…" (pp. 548–549)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      1) “A total of 98 below-average pupils were randomized (T0) … or a
      waiting-list control group (n = 49).” (p. 548)
      
      2) “The study took place in two town-based primary schools … The
      participants in each school were individually allocated through simple
      randomization.” (pp. 548–549)
      
      Thus, S is not met.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They only measured phonological/literacy skills, not all relevant school
      subjects.
    quote: >-
      "The study sought to test … improvements in blending, phoneme segmentation,
      and non-word reading." (p. 549–550)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      1) “To assess phonological skills the Phonological Assessment Battery
      Second Edition (PhAB-2) … [with] four subtests.” (p. 550)
      
      2) “…the study tested whether the intervention group would show
      statistically significant improvements in blending, phoneme segmentation,
      and non-word reading.” (p. 549)
      
      Therefore, A is not met.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They only implemented the program for ~8 weeks, far shorter than a full
      school year.
    quote: >-

      Thus, Y is not met.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention group received extra daily computer-based sessions; the
      control group did not get an equivalent resource allocation.
    quote: >-
      "The intervention group received daily … 20- to 30-min blocks …
      The wait-list control group continued with standard teaching." (pp. 549, 551)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant quotes:
      
      1) “The intervention group received daily, individual, adult-supervised, 20-

      Therefore, B is not met.
  g:

    explanation: >-
      They only conducted a 2-month follow-up, not tracking the children through
      their school-level graduation.
