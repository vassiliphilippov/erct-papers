  Background. Many school‑based interventions are delivered without evidence  
  of effectiveness. Aims. This study evaluated the Lexia Reading Core5  
  program with 4‑ to 6‑year‑olds in Northern Ireland. Sample. One hundred and  
  twenty‑six pupils were screened; ninety‑eight below‑average readers were  
  randomised to an 8‑week block of daily Lexia (n = 49) or a wait‑list  
  control (n = 49). Methods. Phonological skills were assessed after the  
  block and again two months later. Results. Lexia pupils made significantly  
  greater gains in blending and non‑word reading that were maintained at  
  follow‑up. Conclusions. A computer‑based early‑intervention can boost
  phonological skills when difficulties are not tied to phonological working  
  memory.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “A total of 98 below‑average pupils were randomised … to either an  
      8‑week block … or a waiting‑list control group.”

      2) “This study is … the first participant‑level, RCT of Lexia with  
      Year 1 and 2 pupils conducted to date.”

      3) “The first author enrolled participants while the second author used  
      simple randomisation … and assigned participants to the two groups.”

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomisation occurred at the individual‑pupil level within classes,  
      not at class or school level, allowing potential contamination.  
      Consequently the Class‑level RCT criterion is not satisfied.

      Final sentence: Randomisation below class level means criterion C is  
      not met.

      “first participant‑level, RCT of Lexia …”
    explanation: >-
      Pupils rather than whole classes were randomised.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “To assess phonological skills the Phonological Assessment Battery  
      Second Edition (PhAB‑2) were used.”

      2) “In 2013 the PhAB‑2 was standardised with a sample of 773 (4‑ to 11‑year‑olds) children in  
      England, Scotland and Wales.”

      3) “It contains a standardised protocol for both test administration and  
      scoring, …”

      Detailed Analysis:

      Outcomes were measured with the PhAB‑2, a published, validated,  
      norm‑referenced test, satisfying the Exam‑based Assessment requirement.

      Final sentence: Use of a recognised standardised exam meets criterion E.
    quote: >-
      “Phonological Assessment Battery Second Edition (PhAB‑2) …”
    explanation: >-
      A validated standardised exam (PhAB‑2) was used.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The study ran from December 2014 to June 2015.”

      2) “Tests were administered … in December (T0), April (T1) and June (T2).”

      Detailed Analysis:

      Baseline in December and primary post‑test in April give a four‑month  
      interval – at least one academic term – satisfying the Term‑Duration  
      requirement.

      Final sentence: Measurement one term after start meets criterion T.
    quote: >-
      “Tests were administered … December (T0), April (T1) …”
    explanation: >-
      Post‑test occurred four months after the December start.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Allocated to wait‑list control group (n = 49).”

      2) “standard classroom teaching in line with the statutory Northern  
      Irish curriculum …”

      3) “Table 1. Descriptive data … Number of boys, age, EAL status, T0  
      scores …”

      Detailed Analysis:

      Size, demographics and baseline attainment of the control group are  
      reported, fulfilling the Documented Control Group requirement.

      Final sentence: Control group documentation meets criterion D.
    quote: >-

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The study took place in two town‑based primary schools …”

      2) “98 below‑average pupils were randomised …”

      Detailed Analysis:

      Only two schools participated and randomisation was at the pupil level,  
      not at the school level. Therefore School‑level RCT is not achieved.

      Final sentence: Absence of school‑level assignment means criterion S is  
      not met.
    quote: >-
      “participant‑level, RCT of Lexia …”
    explanation: >-
      Randomisation took place within, not between, schools.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The study was run in conjunction with the Educational Psychology  
      Service and the School of Psychology … overseen by a qualified  
      Educational and Child Psychologist.”

      2) “pre‑intervention set‑up and … technical support were provided … by  
      LexiaUK Ltd.”

      Detailed Analysis:

      Investigators are university and public‑service staff, independent of the  
      commercial developer, who only offered technical assistance. No evidence  
      suggests Lexia staff collected or analysed data. Hence Independent  
      Conduct is satisfied.

      Final sentence: Independent evaluation team meets criterion I.
    quote: >-
      “run … by the Educational Psychology Service and the School of Psychology”
    explanation: >-
      Researchers were not affiliated with the program’s developer.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The study ran from December 2014 to June 2015.”

      2) “Recruitment began in December 2014, with T1 testing in April 2015 and  
      T2 testing in June 2015.”

      Detailed Analysis:

      Total tracking was roughly six months – less than a full academic year.  
      Therefore the Year‑Duration criterion is not satisfied.

      Final sentence: Six‑month follow‑up fails criterion Y.
    quote: >-
      “The study ran from December 2014 to June 2015.”
    explanation: >-
      Only six months of data – under one school year.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The intervention group received daily … 20‑ to 30‑min blocks of  
      computer‑based support … for 8 weeks (x = 647.51 min).”

      2) “Wait‑list control group … standard classroom teaching …”

      Detailed Analysis:

      Additional daily computer‑based instruction time is the essence of the  
      treatment being tested; the study explicitly aims to gauge the benefit of  
      that extra resource. Under ERCT, when extra time is the treatment  
      variable, a business‑as‑usual control is acceptable, so balance is not  
      required.

      Final sentence: Extra time is integral; criterion B is met.
    quote: >-
      “daily … 20‑ to 30‑min blocks of computer‑based support …”
    explanation: >-
      Extra resources constituted the treatment itself, making balance proper.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “This study is … the first participant‑level, RCT of Lexia … conducted  
      to date.”

      2) “This trial of Lexia involved 697 pupils across 57 schools. The independent evaluation found that children … offered Lexia made the equivalent of one additional months’ progress in reading …”

      Detailed Analysis:

      The authors noted this was the first participant‑level Lexia RCT with no prior replications. However, a subsequent independent trial (Quote 2) confirmed similar gains with a different research team. Therefore, the Reproduced criterion is now satisfied.

      Final sentence: Independent replication achieved, so criterion R is met.
    quote: >-
      “the equivalent of one additional months’ progress in reading …”
    explanation: >-
      The study’s findings were later replicated by an independent team.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The first research question … improvements in blending, phoneme  
      segmentation, and non‑word reading …”

      2) “We used four subtests on the PhAB‑2 … Blending … Segmentation …  
      Non‑Word Reading.”

      Detailed Analysis:

      Only literacy‑specific outcomes were measured; maths, science and other  
      core subjects were not assessed. Consequently All‑subject Exams criterion  
      is not met.

      Final sentence: Narrow literacy focus fails criterion A.
    quote: >-
      “improvements in blending, phoneme segmentation, and non‑word reading”
    explanation: >-
      The study measured literacy only, not all subjects.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “gains were maintained … at 2‑month follow‑up.”

      2) “The study ran from December 2014 to June 2015.”

      Detailed Analysis:

      The longest follow‑up is only two months post‑intervention, far short of  
      tracking pupils until completion of their current school stage. Without  
      such data the Graduation‑Tracking criterion is not satisfied.

      Final sentence: No graduation follow‑up, so criterion G is not met.
    quote: >-
      “gains were maintained … at 2‑month follow‑up.”
    explanation: >-
      Follow‑up ended two months after the block, not at graduation.

      Relevant Quotes:

      No mention of trial registration or protocol pre‑registration appears in  
      the article.

      Detailed Analysis:

      A search of methods, acknowledgements and footnotes finds no registry ID  
      or pre‑registration date. Thus the Pre‑Registered Protocol criterion is  
      not met.

      Final sentence: Absence of pre‑registration means criterion P is not met.
    quote: null
    explanation: >-
      The paper provides no evidence of pre‑registration.
    met: false
