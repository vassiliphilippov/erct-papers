      Randomization is at the student level, but the intervention is an
      individualized AI personalized learning platform, fitting ERCT's personal
      teaching exception.

      "Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) design was
      adopted, enrolling 40 full-time medical undergraduates who were stratified
      by baseline academic performance and then randomly assigned via
      computer-generated block randomization (block size = 4) into an
      experimental group (n = 20, AI intervention) and a control group (n = 20,
      traditional instruction)." (p. 1)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) design was
      adopted, enrolling 40 full-time medical undergraduates who were stratified
      by baseline academic performance and then randomly assigned via
      computer-generated block randomization (block size = 4) into an
      experimental group (n = 20, AI intervention) and a control group (n = 20,
      traditional instruction)." (p. 1)

      2) "The experimental group received a 12-week personalized learning
      intervention through the Coze platform, with specific measures including:
      Dynamic learning path optimization: Weekly adjustment of learning content
      difficulty and sequence based on diagnostic test results; Affective sensing
      support: Real-time identification of learning emotions through natural
      language processing (NLP) with triggered motivational feedback; Intelligent
      resource recommendation: Integration of a 2,800-case medical database
      utilizing BERT models to match personalized learning resources; Clinical
      simulation interaction: Embedded virtual case system providing real-time
      operational guidance." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C prefers class-level randomization to prevent contamination, but
      ERCT allows an exception when the intervention is designed for personal
      teaching or tutoring.

      Here, the unit of randomization is individual students ("40 full-time
      medical undergraduates ... randomly assigned"). However, the intervention
      is explicitly an individualized "personalized learning" system with
      adaptive paths and personalized recommendations, functioning as a personal
      tutoring style tool rather than a class-wide instructional method.

      Therefore, despite student-level randomization, the intervention fits the
      ERCT personal teaching exception.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is met/not met because the
      intervention is individualized personal teaching, so student-level
      randomization is acceptable under the ERCT exception.

      The study reports using a standardized test bank (LCME) with reliability
      and validity evidence rather than a bespoke study-created exam.
    quote: >-
      "This study employs the standardized test bank of the Accreditation
      Council for Medical Education (LCME) to assess learning effectiveness."

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study employs the standardized test bank of the Accreditation
      Council for Medical Education (LCME) to assess learning effectiveness."
      (p. 5)

      2) "The tool includes three parallel test sets (A/B/C), covers Bloom's
      taxonomy levels, and demonstrates high reliability (α = 0.89) and validity
      (CVI = 0.91). Scoring used IRT calibration and double-blind marking."
      (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires exam-based assessment using a standardized,
      externally-defined instrument, not an ad-hoc test created solely for this
      study.

      The paper explicitly describes the outcome test as a "standardized test
      bank" attributed to LCME, and provides psychometric evidence (reliability,
      validity) plus standardized scoring practices (IRT calibration, double-
      blind marking). While the paper's description is unusual in naming, it is
      still presented as a standardized test bank rather than a custom exam
      authored for this trial.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is met/not met because the study
      states it used a standardized test bank (with reliability and validity
      evidence) rather than a bespoke study-specific exam.

      Outcomes were measured at Week 12 after the intervention began, matching
      a term-length (approximately 12 weeks) follow-up window.
    quote: >-
      "The experimental group received a 12-week personalized learning
      intervention through the Coze platform..." (p. 1)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The experimental group received a 12-week personalized learning
      intervention through the Coze platform..." (p. 1)

      2) "Data was collected at: Baseline (Week 0): Demographics, pre-test
      scores, learning behavior. Intervention Period (Weeks 4, 8, 12): Platform
      logs, diagnostic tests, classroom recordings, engagement metrics. Endpoint
      (Week 12): Post-test, satisfaction survey, motivation scales." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires that outcomes are measured at least one academic term
      after the intervention begins. A term is typically around 3-4 months.

      The intervention is explicitly stated as "12-week", and the measurement
      schedule specifies an endpoint at Week 12, where the post-test and other
      outcomes are collected. Twelve weeks is approximately three months and is
      commonly treated as term-length in many academic calendars.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is met/not met because outcomes
      were measured at Week 12 after the intervention began, which is consistent
      with a term-length follow-up period.

      The control condition is described in detail and baseline characteristics
      are reported for both groups.
    quote: >-
      "The control group followed the traditional lecture-based model: 4 h/week
      of teacher-centered instruction using standardized textbooks (e.g.,
      Systematic Anatomy)." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The control group followed the traditional lecture-based model: 4
      h/week of teacher-centered instruction using standardized textbooks (e.g.,
      Systematic Anatomy). Learning reinforcement included weekly quizzes
      (multiple-choice, short-answer) graded uniformly by the teaching office.
      No digital tools or personalized feedback were used." (p. 4)

      2) "The baseline academic performance data showed no statistically
      significant difference in pre-test knowledge reserves between the two
      groups (Experimental Group: 70.40 ± 8.96 points vs. Control Group:
      70.20 ± 11.40 points, p = 0.950). In terms of demographic characteristics,
      the gender distribution was balanced (Experimental Group: male:female =
      12:8; Control Group: 11:9, χ^{2} = 0.06, p = 0.812), and age indicators
      also showed high consistency (Experimental group 18.10 ± 0.97 years vs.
      Control group 18.15 ± 0.81 years, t(38) = 0.36, p = 0.724)." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control group is well documented, including
      what it received and baseline comparability.

      The paper provides a concrete description of the control condition
      (lecture-based instruction, hours per week, materials, reinforcement, and
      explicit absence of digital tools). It also reports baseline academic and
      demographic characteristics (scores, gender, age) demonstrating
      comparability between groups.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met/not met because the paper
      clearly describes the control condition and reports baseline
      characteristics enabling meaningful comparison.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization occurs at the student level rather than assigning whole
      schools or sites.

      computer-generated block randomization (block size = 4) into an
      experimental group (n = 20, AI intervention) and a control group (n = 20,
      traditional instruction)." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires a school-level (or site-level) RCT where schools are
      randomized to treatment or control.

      The methods explicitly state that individual students ("40 full-time
      medical undergraduates") were randomized into two groups. There is no
      indication of multiple schools being assigned to conditions.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is met/not met because the unit
      of randomization is students, not schools or sites.

    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper does not provide evidence that the evaluation was conducted by
      an independent team distinct from the intervention designer.
    quote: >-

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The platform was built on the Coze open-source framework (v2.4.1) and
      featured a three-layer architecture designed for medical education:"
      (p. 5)

      2) "Author contributions: YC: Writing – original draft, Writing – review &
      editing." (p. 15)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires clear evidence that the study was conducted
      independently from the designers of the intervention.

      The paper describes the AI platform's construction in a way that indicates
      close involvement of the author with the intervention itself. The author
      list is a single person, and the paper does not state that data collection,
      implementation, or analysis was performed by an external evaluator or an
      independent evaluation organization.

      While the paper mentions that the allocation sequence was managed by an
      independent third-party researcher (randomization logistics), that is not
      sufficient to establish independent conduct of the overall intervention
      evaluation.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is met/not met because the paper
      provides no explicit evidence of an independent evaluation team distinct
      from the intervention designer.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Despite stating a one-year study period, outcomes are reported at Week 12
      rather than after a full academic year of follow-up.
    quote: >-
      "The study period was from August 10, 2024, to August 10, 2025." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study period was from August 10, 2024, to August 10, 2025." (p. 3)

      2) "The experimental group received a 12-week personalized learning
      intervention through the Coze platform..." (p. 1)

      3) "Data was collected at: ... Intervention Period (Weeks 4, 8, 12)...
      Endpoint (Week 12): Post-test, satisfaction survey, motivation scales."
      (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires that outcomes are measured at least one full academic
      year after the intervention begins.

      Although the paper states a one-year "study period", the intervention and
      the explicit measurement schedule culminate at Week 12, with the endpoint
      post-test and surveys collected then. The paper does not report a later
      end-of-year outcome assessment aligned with a 9-10 month academic year
      follow-up.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is met/not met because the
      reported outcome measurement schedule ends at Week 12 rather than after a
      full academic year of follow-up.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention intentionally adds an AI platform as the treatment, so
      the control remains business-as-usual by design under ERCT's resource
      treatment exception.
    quote: >-
      "The experimental group used the Coze-based AI Personalized Learning
      Platform (AI-PLP) alongside 4 h/week of traditional instruction." (p. 4)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The experimental group used the Coze-based AI Personalized Learning
      Platform (AI-PLP) alongside 4 h/week of traditional instruction." (p. 4)

      2) "The control group followed the traditional lecture-based model: 4
      h/week of teacher-centered instruction using standardized textbooks (e.g.,
      Systematic Anatomy). ... No digital tools or personalized feedback were
      used." (p. 4)

      3) "Daily average learning duration extended by 41.5% (49.25 ± 18.59 vs.
      34.80 ± 18.32 min, p = 0.048, d = 0.49)..." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B requires comparable educational inputs across conditions unless
      the additional time or resources are themselves the treatment variable.

      This study's treatment is explicitly the provision and use of the AI-PLP,
      added on top of the same baseline instruction time (4 h/week) that the
      control group receives. The control group is explicitly business-as-usual
      without the platform. The paper also reports that learning time increased
      in the experimental group, which is plausibly a mechanism of the platform.

      Under ERCT's decision rule, when the extra resource is integral to the
      intervention being tested (here, access to the AI-PLP), the control may
      remain business-as-usual. The imbalance does not automatically violate
      criterion B because the resource difference is the intended treatment
      contrast.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met/not met because the extra
      resource (AI-PLP access) is the treatment variable by design, so a
      business-as-usual control is acceptable under ERCT criterion B.
  r:

    explanation: >-
      No independent replication study of this specific intervention trial was
      found in available sources at the time of this ERCT check.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      (No quotes found in the paper regarding an independent replication of this
      specific RCT, and no external replication paper was located.)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires independent reproduction by other authors.

      The paper is a recent (2025) single-site student-level RCT. Searches across
      major public indexing and hosting sources (Frontiers landing page, PubMed,
      and PubMed Central full text) did not identify a separate peer-reviewed
      replication study by an independent team that explicitly repeats this
      intervention and reports results.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is met/not met because no
      independent replication study could be identified at the time of checking.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes are limited to a single course or domain rather than standardized
      exams across all main subjects.
    quote: >-
      "The control group followed the traditional lecture-based teaching model
      ... using standardized textbooks (e.g., Systematic Anatomy)." (p. 4)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The control group followed the traditional lecture-based model: 4
      h/week of teacher-centered instruction using standardized textbooks (e.g.,
      Systematic Anatomy)." (p. 4)

      2) "The following data were collected ... Academic performance: 3
      standardized tests before and after the intervention..." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam outcomes across all main subjects
      taught (or a clearly justified specialized exception).

      The context and materials indicate a specific course domain (e.g.,
      "Systematic Anatomy"), and the reported academic outcome is based on a set
      of tests tied to that domain. The paper does not report standardized exams
      across the broader set of concurrent subjects in a medical curriculum.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is met/not met because the study
      measures performance in a limited domain rather than all main subjects.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not track participants until graduation and, since Year
      Duration is not met, Graduation Tracking cannot be met under ERCT rules.
    quote: >-
      "Future directions include ... longitudinal tracking..." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Future directions include multicenter large-sample studies,
      longitudinal tracking, and interdisciplinary applications to advance the
      intelligent transformation of educational models." (p. 2)

      2) "Data was collected at: ... Endpoint (Week 12): Post-test, satisfaction
      survey, motivation scales." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking through graduation, and ERCT specifies that
      if criterion Y is not met, criterion G is not met.

      The paper's measurement schedule ends at Week 12 and explicitly frames
      "longitudinal tracking" as a future direction rather than something done
      in this study. No graduation outcomes are reported.

      A web search for follow-up publications by the same author tracking the
      same cohort to graduation did not locate any such paper at the time of
      this check.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is met/not met because the study
      ends at Week 12 with no graduation follow-up, and Year Duration is not met.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper does not report a pre-registered protocol or registry entry that
      can be verified as registered prior to data collection.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      (No quotes found in the paper providing a trial registry name, registry
      identifier, or a public pre-registration link.)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires a publicly verifiable pre-registration made before
      data collection begins.

      The paper reports ethics approval and informed consent but does not provide
      a trial registration number, registry link, OSF link, or any pre-analysis
      plan identifier. Targeted web searches for registrations using the DOI,
      title, author, and ethics approval number did not identify a corresponding
      public pre-registration entry.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is met/not met because no
      verifiable pre-registration record is reported or discoverable from the
      available sources.
