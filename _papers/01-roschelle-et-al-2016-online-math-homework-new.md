abstract: >-
  In a randomized field trial with 2,850 seventh-grade mathematics
  students, we evaluated whether an educational technology intervention
  increased math learning. Assigning homework is common yet sometimes
  controversial. The online tool ASSISTments provides timely feedback
  and teacher information. Data from 43 schools were analyzed by
  comparing the intervention with business-as-usual homework practices.

    explanation: "Randomization was conducted among entire schools, which meets or exceeds the class-level requirement."
    quote: "\"Schools were placed into pairs ... and pairs were randomly assigned to treatment and control.\" (p. 6)"
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "We investigated this question through a randomized controlled
      experiment in which schools were assigned to either an intervention
      or a business-as-usual condition." (p. 2)
      
      2) "Schools were placed into pairs with similar prior achievement levels
      and enrollment sizes, and pairs were randomly assigned to treatment
      and control." (p. 5)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      The study randomizes at the school level, reducing risks of bias and
      contamination within classes. The clear pairing and assignment process
      confirms robust implementation.
      
      Final sentence: The criterion is fully met.

      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "Schools were placed into pairs with similar prior achievement levels
      and enrollment sizes, and pairs were randomly assigned to treatment
      and control." (p. 6)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      Randomization at the school level is the gold standard for
      educational RCTs. It minimizes bias and captures real-world
      implementation factors.
      
      Final sentence: The school-level RCT criterion is fully met.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: "Only mathematics achievement was measured, not all main subjects."
    quote: "\"We administered the TerraNova standardized test ... in mathematics ... we focused on mathematics achievement.\" (p. 5)"
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      students during the second school year." (pp. 3–4)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      A full academic year of implementation ensures that the effects are
      measured over a sustained period, which meets the year duration
      requirement.
      
      Final sentence: The year duration criterion is met.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: "The treatment group received additional resources that were not matched for the control group."
    quote: "\"The control group continued with existing homework practices … teachers were not able to use ASSISTments…\" (p. 2)"
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) "During the summer, undergraduates entered all the homework problems
      into ASSISTments ... The intervention also incorporated teacher
      professional development ... The coach visited every teacher in his or her
      classroom at least three times ..." (pp. 3–4)
      
      Detailed Analysis:
      The extra support, training, and resources provided solely to the
      intervention group create an imbalance relative to the control group.
