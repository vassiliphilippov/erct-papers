abstract: >-
  In a randomized field trial with 2,850 seventh-grade mathematics students,
  we evaluated whether an educational technology intervention increased
  mathematics learning. Assigning homework is common yet sometimes
  controversial. Building on prior research on formative assessment and
  adaptive teaching, we predicted that combining an online homework tool
  with teacher training could increase learning. The online tool ASSISTments
  (a) provides timely feedback and hints to students as they do homework and
  (b) gives teachers timely, organized information about students’ work. To
  test this prediction, we analyzed data from 43 schools that participated in
  a random assignment experiment in Maine, a state that provides every
  seventh-grade student with a laptop to take home. Results showed that the
  intervention significantly increased student scores on an end-of-the-year
  standardized mathematics assessment as compared with a control group that
  continued with existing homework practices. Students with low prior
  mathematics achievement benefited most. The intervention has potential for
  wider adoption.

    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The study randomised entire schools to treatment or control conditions,
      which meets the requirement for class-level randomisation as per the
      ERCT standard.
    quote: >-
      "schools were placed into pairs with similar prior achievement levels
      and enrollment sizes, and pairs were randomly assigned to treatment and
      control."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We investigated this question through a randomized controlled
      experiment in which schools were assigned to either an intervention or a
      business-as-usual condition." (p. 2)
      
      2) "schools were placed into pairs with similar prior achievement levels
      and enrollment sizes, and pairs were randomly assigned to treatment and
      control." (p. 5)
      
      3) "The net result was 43 schools in the final analytic sample, consisting
      of randomly assigned pairs (n = 40) plus three schools that had never been
      paired and were individually randomly assigned to treatment (n = 2) or
      control (n = 1)." (p. 4)
      
      Detailed analysis: The ERCT standard requires that interventions are
      tested at the classroom level to prevent cross-group contamination.
      However, the standard also notes that school-level randomisation is
      stronger and automatically satisfies the class-level RCT criterion. In this
      study, the authors explicitly state that randomisation was conducted at
      the school level, with schools being assigned to either the intervention or
      control condition. This approach ensures that all classes within a school
      are in the same condition, thereby preventing contamination between
      treatment and control groups within the same school. The quotes provided
      confirm this randomisation procedure.
      
      The criterion is met because the study randomised entire schools, which
      is a stronger form of randomisation than the class level required by the
      ERCT standard.

      The study used the TerraNova standardized test, which is a widely
      recognised and appropriate assessment tool for seventh-grade mathematics.
    quote: >-
      "To measure students’ levels of achievement at the end of the intervention,
      we administered the TerraNova standardized test."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      1) "To measure students’ levels of achievement at the end of the
      intervention, we administered the TerraNova standardized test. We chose
      TerraNova because it has well-established and reputable psychometric
      qualities." (p. 5)
      2) "TerraNova’s content is aligned with the Common Core Standards for
      Mathematics and represents mathematics curriculum taught throughout the
      United States." (p. 6)
      3) "The TerraNova mathematics test at Level 17 is appropriate for Grade 7;
      it has 37 items and requires 1.5 hr to administer." (p. 6)
      Detailed analysis: The ERCT standard requires the use of standardised
      exam-based assessments that are widely recognised and not specially
      designed for the study. In this paper, the authors used the TerraNova
      standardized test, which is a nationally normed assessment tool widely
      used in educational research. The test is appropriate for seventh-grade
      students and covers mathematics content aligned with common curricula.
      The authors explicitly state that the test was not modified or aligned
      specifically with the intervention, ensuring that it serves as an objective
      measure of student achievement.
      The criterion is met because the study employed the TerraNova standardized
      test, a widely recognised and appropriate assessment tool for the student
      population.

      The intervention was implemented throughout a full school year, meeting
      the requirement for at least one academic term.
    quote: >-
      "teachers in Maine were newly trained to use ASSISTments and then
      deployed it with all their students throughout a full year of seventh-grade

      Relevant Quotes:
      1) "teachers in Maine were newly trained to use ASSISTments and then
      deployed it with all their students throughout a full year of seventh-grade
      mathematics instruction." (p. 2)
      2) "Students in the ASSISTments condition used the system, on average,
      for 967 mathematics problems and for 14 hr in the course of a school year."
      (p. 6)
      3) "Teachers used ASSISTments with a new cohort of seventh-grade students
      during the second school year." (p. 5)
      Detailed analysis: The ERCT standard requires that the study lasts at
      least one academic term to ensure meaningful impacts can be measured. In
      this study, the intervention was implemented throughout a full school year,
      as evidenced by the quotes indicating that teachers used ASSISTments for
      the entire year of seventh-grade mathematics instruction. A full school
      year typically spans 9-10 months, which is longer than a single academic
      term (usually 3-4 months). Therefore, the duration of the intervention
      exceeds the minimum requirement set by the standard.
      The criterion is met because the intervention was conducted over a full
      school year, which is longer than the required academic term.

      The study provides evidence of baseline equivalence between treatment and
      control groups and describes the control group's conditions.
    quote: >-
      "Analyses found no difference between the treatment and control groups in
      various demographic and predictor variables."
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      1) "Analyses found no difference between the treatment and control groups
      in various demographic and predictor variables." (p. 6)
      2) "Multilevel logistic models found no control-versus-treatment condition
      differences in student-level FRL status, γ = 0.012, t(21) = 0.121, p = .905;
      non-White/non-Hispanic heritage, γ = −0.219, t(21) = −0.809, p = .427; IEP
      status, γ = −0.013, t(21) = −0.115, p = .910; and student sex, γ = 0.100,
      t(21) = 1.747, p = .095. Multilevel regression found no treatment condition
      differences in prior year math performance, γ = 0.194, t(21) = 0.463, p =
      .648, or prior year reading performance, γ = −0.139, t(21) = −0.177, p =
      .861." (p. 6)
      3) "The control group was eventually provided with both ASSISTments and
      the same professional development but after a 2-year delay; thus, it did not
      have access to ASSISTments while we were collecting data." (p. 5)
      Detailed analysis: The ERCT standard requires detailed documentation of
      the control group, including demographic information, baseline performance,
      and any treatments received. In this study, the authors provide evidence of
      baseline equivalence between the treatment and control groups across
      several key variables, including FRL status, race/ethnicity, IEP status,
      gender, and prior achievement in math and reading. This indicates that the
      control group was similar to the treatment group at the start of the study.
      Additionally, the authors describe the conditions for the control group,
      stating that they continued with existing homework practices without access
      to ASSISTments during the data collection period. While specific demographic
      tables for the control group are not provided, the confirmation of baseline
      equivalence and the description of the control conditions meet the
      requirement for documenting the control group.
      The criterion is met because the study provides evidence of baseline
      equivalence and describes the conditions for the control group.

      The study randomised entire schools to treatment or control conditions,
      fulfilling the requirement for a school-level RCT.

      Detailed analysis: The ERCT standard for school-level RCT requires that
      the study randomises entire schools to treatment or control conditions.
      This study explicitly states that schools were the unit of randomisation,
      with schools being paired based on prior achievement and enrollment size
      before random assignment. This approach ensures that the intervention is
      tested in a real-world setting where entire schools implement the treatment
      or continue with business as usual. The quotes provided confirm that the
      randomisation was conducted at the school level, meeting the criterion.
      The criterion is met because the study randomised entire schools to
      treatment or control conditions.

      3) "Scores from the TerraNova Common Core assessment mathematics test
      were used as a primary outcome measure to provide data on student
      achievement in mathematics concepts, processes, and skills." (p. 6)
      Detailed analysis: The ERCT standard requires that the study assesses the
      impact of the intervention on all main subjects taught in the school, not
      just the subject targeted by the intervention. This is to ensure that the
      intervention does not have unintended negative effects on other subjects.
      In this study, the intervention focused on mathematics, and the outcome
      measure was solely the TerraNova mathematics test. There is no mention of
      assessing student performance in other core subjects such as reading,
      science, or social studies. Therefore, the study does not meet the criterion
      for all-subject exams.
      The criterion is not met because the study only assessed student
      achievement in mathematics, not in all main subjects.

      (p. 6)
      3) "Teachers used ASSISTments with a new cohort of seventh-grade students
      during the second school year." (p. 5)
      Detailed analysis: The ERCT standard requires that the intervention lasts
      for at least one full academic year to assess its impact adequately. In this
      study, the intervention was implemented over the entire school year, as
      indicated by the quotes. The authors specify that teachers used ASSISTments
      throughout the full year of seventh-grade mathematics instruction, and
      students engaged with the system over the course of the school year. This
      duration meets the requirement for a year-long intervention.
      The criterion is met because the intervention was conducted over a full
      academic year.

      Relevant Quotes:
      1) "Both teacher groups were expected to assign and review mathematics
      homework for seventh-grade students in accordance with their local school
      policies." (p. 5)
      2) "For both types of content, teachers (rather than the system or
      intervention developers) decided how much and what type of homework was
      assigned, and they were asked to do so in accordance with their existing
      school homework policy." (p. 3)
      3) "We do not expect this to be the case, because the amount of homework
      assigned was set by school policies on homework and we found the policies
      to be similar among schools in our sample." (p. 9)
      Detailed analysis: The ERCT standard requires that the control group
      receives equal time and resources as the treatment group to isolate the
      effect of the intervention. In this study, both the treatment and control
      groups followed their existing school homework policies, with teachers
      deciding the amount and type of homework assigned. The authors note that
      school policies on homework were similar across the sample, suggesting
      that the time students spent on homework was comparable between groups.
      Additionally, the control group continued with their usual homework
      practices without access to ASSISTments, while the treatment group used
      the online platform. Since the intervention did not involve additional time
      or resources beyond what was already allocated for homework, the control
      group is considered balanced.
      The criterion is met because both groups followed similar homework
      policies, ensuring equal time and resources.

      2) "Training and administration of the test occurred near the end of the
      school year." (p. 6)
      Detailed analysis: The ERCT standard requires that the study tracks
      participants until their graduation to assess long-term impacts of the
      intervention. In this study, the outcome measure was administered at the
      end of the seventh-grade year, immediately following the intervention.
      There is no mention of any follow-up assessments or tracking of students
      beyond the seventh grade. Therefore, the study does not meet the criterion
      for graduation tracking.
      The criterion is not met because the study only measured outcomes at the

      Relevant Quotes:
      1) "Three prior research studies involving small numbers of students and
      few instructional days are described here, and they showed that
      ASSISTments could have an effect on learning." (p. 2)
      2) "Overall, these studies offer preliminary evidence for the effectiveness
      of ASSISTments but conflate the timing of feedback (immediate vs. delayed)
      and the modality of feedback (from a computer or a teacher). The experiments
      involved less than a week of instruction, whereas the present study lasted
      an entire school year." (p. 3)
      Detailed analysis: The ERCT standard requires that the study has been
      independently replicated by a different research team in a different context
      to ensure the robustness and generalisability of the findings. While the
      paper mentions prior small-scale studies that showed positive effects of
      ASSISTments, these studies were not full replications of the current
      large-scale, year-long intervention. They were shorter in duration and
      involved fewer students, and they were likely conducted by the same or
      related research teams. There is no mention in the paper of an independent
      replication of this specific study design and intervention. Therefore, the
      criterion for reproduced results is not met.

      3) The authors are listed as Jeremy Roschelle, Mingyu Feng, Robert F.
      Murphy from SRI International, and Craig A. Mason from the University of
      Maine. (p. 12)
      Detailed analysis: The ERCT standard requires that the study is conducted
      independently from the authors who designed the intervention to minimize
      potential bias. In this case, the intervention (ASSISTments) was developed
      by Neil and Cristina Heffernan at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, while
      the study was conducted by researchers from SRI International and the
      University of Maine. The authors explicitly state that they have no
      financial interest in ASSISTments, further ensuring independence.
      Therefore, the criterion for independent conduct is met.
      The criterion is met because the study was conducted by researchers
      independent from the designers of the intervention.

      2) "To estimate the impacts of the intervention on student learning, we
      developed analytic models that reflect the clustering of students." (p. 6)
      Detailed analysis: The ERCT standard requires that the study protocol is
      pre-registered before data collection begins to increase transparency and
      reduce the risk of selective reporting. In this paper, there is no mention
      of pre-registration of the study protocol, hypotheses, methods, or planned
      analyses. The authors describe the research design and analytic approach
      but do not reference any public registry or pre-registration document.
      Therefore, the criterion for pre-registration is not met.
