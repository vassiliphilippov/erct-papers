abstract: >-
  Widespread smartphone bans are being implemented in classrooms worldwide, yet
  their causal effects on student outcomes remain unclear. In a randomized
  controlled trial involving nearly 17,000 students, we find that mandatory
  in-class phone collection led to higher grades - particularly among
  lower-performing, first-year, and non-STEM students - with an average increase
  of 0.086 standard deviations. Importantly, students exposed to the ban were
  substantially more supportive of phone-use restrictions, perceiving greater
  benefits from these policies and displaying reduced preferences for
  unrestricted access. This enhanced student receptivity to restrictive digital
  policies may create a self-reinforcing cycle, where positive firsthand
  experiences strengthen support for continued implementation. Despite a mild
  rise in reported fear of missing out, there were no significant changes in
  overall student well-being, academic motivation, digital usage, or experiences
  of online harassment. Random classroom spot checks revealed fewer instances of
  student chatter and disruptive behaviors, along with reduced phone usage and
  increased engagement among teachers in phone-ban classrooms, suggesting a
  classroom environment more conducive to learning. Spot checks also revealed
  that students appear more distracted, possibly due to withdrawal from habitual
  phone checking, yet, students did not report being more distracted. These
  results suggest that in-class phone bans represent a low-cost, effective
  policy to modestly improve academic outcomes, especially for vulnerable
  student groups, while enhancing student receptivity to digital policy
  interventions.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Student cohorts were randomly assigned at the department-grade level
      (i.e., a cohort) to either a mandatory in-class phone
      collection-requiring students to deposit their devices at the start of
      each lecture-or to a business-as-usual control group, where phone use
      remained unrestricted." (pp. 2-3)

      2) "We randomized academic departments within each HEIs, stratified by
      semester, into treatment and control courses with equal probability."
      (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The unit of randomization is the department-grade cohort within each
      higher education institute. This is a group-level assignment (above the
      individual student) and is at least as strong as a class-level RCT for
      preventing contamination between treatment and control students.

      Criterion C is met because treatment was randomized at a cohort
      (department-grade) level rather than within the same classroom.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "First, we obtained each student's objective final grades and
      attendance records from both before and during the study period." (p. 14)

      2) "Specifically, we obtained official final grades from institutional
      examination records and cross-checked them with departmental transcripts."
      (p. 21)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Academic outcomes are based on official final grades taken from
      institutional examination records. These are standard assessments used by
      the institutions for their courses and were not created by researchers for
      this intervention.

      Criterion E is met because outcomes use official exam-based grades rather
      than a custom assessment designed for the study.
    quote: >-

      1) "The treatment period spanned the full Spring 2024 semester
      (February-May 2024), although start and end dates varied slightly by
      institution." (p. 19)

      2) "This protocol was applied in all classes for the treatment arm
      throughout the Spring 2024 semester, while students in the control
      departments maintained their usual access to phones." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention and outcome tracking cover the full Spring 2024 semester
      (February-May), which corresponds to an academic term (approximately one
      semester).

      Criterion T is met because outcomes were measured after at least one full
      academic term of exposure.
    quote: >-

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Student cohorts were randomly assigned ... to a business-as-usual
      control group, where phone use remained unrestricted." (pp. 2-3)

      2) "In control departments, teachers and students continued their regular
      classroom routines, retaining access to smartphones during lectures."
      (p. 19)

      3) "Baseline academic performance is balanced across treatment and control
      groups, with no statistically significant differences in prior GPA levels
      under any specification (SI Table B.1)." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper describes the control condition as business-as-usual with
      unrestricted phone access. It also documents baseline comparability using
      prior GPA balance tests, supporting that the control group is clearly
      specified and empirically characterized.

      Criterion D is met because the control condition is described and baseline
      performance balance is documented.
    quote: >-
      In control departments, teachers and students continued their regular
      classroom routines, retaining access to smartphones during lectures.

      2) "Notably, many classrooms were shared by both treatment and control
      arms." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomization occurred within each higher education institute by assigning
      departments (and cohorts) to treatment or control. Because institutions
      themselves were not randomized, the study is not a school-level RCT in the
      ERCT sense.

      Criterion S is not met because assignment was within schools, not among
      schools.
    quote: >-
      We randomized academic departments within each HEIs, stratified by
      semester, into treatment and control courses with equal probability.
    explanation: >-
      Randomization was within institutions (departments/cohorts), not between
      institutions, so it is not a school-level RCT.

      manuscript." (p. 15)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The author contribution statement shows that the same author team designed
      the study, led field operations, and conducted the analysis. The paper
      does not describe an independent third-party evaluation organization or
      an external analysis team separated from the intervention designers.

      Criterion I is not met because the study was implemented and analyzed by
      the same team that designed it, without independent evaluation.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Outcome tracking is limited to a single semester (February-May 2024),
      which is substantially shorter than a full academic year.

      Criterion Y is not met because the study duration does not cover a full
      academic year.

      The study covers one semester rather than a full academic year, so the
      year-duration requirement is not met.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Notably, many classrooms were shared by both treatment and control
      arms. Therefore, we placed phone-boxes in all classrooms." (p. 14)

      2) "The key difference between the two arms lies not in the presence of
      the boxes themselves, but in the enforcement protocol requiring students
      in the treatment arm to deposit their phones." (p. 14)

      3) "In control departments, teachers and students continued their regular
      classroom routines, retaining access to smartphones during lectures."
      (p. 19)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The intervention did not add instructional time, tutoring, or other
      educational resources; it changed a classroom policy (mandatory phone
      deposit). The main material input (phone boxes) was installed in all
      classrooms because rooms were shared, so the control condition matched the
      physical resource. The remaining difference is the enforcement protocol,
      which is the intervention being tested.

      Criterion B is met because the only notable material resource was provided
      in both arms and the study does not introduce extra instructional time or
      budget in treatment beyond the intended policy enforcement.
    quote: >-
      The key difference between the two arms lies not in the presence of the
      boxes themselves, but in the enforcement protocol requiring students in
      the treatment arm to deposit their phones.
    explanation: >-
      Phone boxes were installed in all classrooms and the intervention was a
      policy enforcement rather than added instructional resources, so inputs
      are balanced.

      across 10 higher ed-ucation institutions, conducted in Spring 2024."
      (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper reports a single original RCT. The paper does not claim that it
      is a replication of a prior RCT, and it does not report an independent
      replication conducted by other authors. A web search (by title and DOI)
      did not identify any peer-reviewed, independent reproduction of this
      specific RCT as of the ERCT check date.

      Criterion R is not met because no independent, peer-reviewed replication
      of this study was found.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Because assignment was at the department-grade level, students
      experienced the same treatment condition consistently across nearly all
      their courses throughout the semester." (p. 3)

      2) "We obtained each student's objective final grades and attendance
      records from both before and during the study period." (p. 14)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The main academic outcome is overall grades (GPA / average grades) and the
      treatment assignment applies across nearly all courses taken by students
      in the cohort. This means the outcome aggregates performance across many
      subjects/courses rather than measuring only a single subject. Criterion E
      is met, so exam-based course grades can be used for this criterion.

      Criterion A is met because the study evaluates broad academic performance
      across (nearly) all courses rather than a single subject outcome.

      2) "Our findings also suggest that improved academic performance due to
      classroom phone bans could have downstream effects on graduation rates."
      (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study measures outcomes during a single semester and does not report
      follow-up until graduation. The only mention of graduation is speculative
      ("could have downstream effects") rather than reporting observed
      graduation outcomes. In addition, criterion Y is not met (the study does
      not span a full academic year), and under the ERCT rule this implies
      criterion G cannot be met for this paper.

      Criterion G is not met because participants were not tracked to
      graduation and outcomes were measured only within one semester.
    quote: >-
      Our findings also suggest that improved academic performance due to
      classroom phone bans could have downstream effects on graduation rates.

      The paper reports only semester-end outcomes and does not track students
      to graduation.

      5) "No, no data have been collected for this study yet." (AsPredicted
      #160,190)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper links to a specific pre-registration record on AsPredicted and
      repeatedly describes the protocol and analysis plan as pre-registered.
      The registry page reports a pre-registration timestamp of 2024/01/30,
      which is before the Spring 2024 study period described in the paper.

      Criterion P is met because the study provides a pre-registration link and
      the registry shows it was registered before data collection began.
