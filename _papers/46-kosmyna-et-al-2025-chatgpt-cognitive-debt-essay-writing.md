abstract: >-
  With today's wide adoption of LLM products like ChatGPT from OpenAI,
  humans and businesses engage and use LLMs on a daily basis. Like any
  other tool, it carries its own set of advantages and limitations.
  This study focuses on finding out the cognitive cost of using an LLM
  in the educational context of writing an essay. We assigned
  participants to three groups: LLM group, Search Engine group,
  Brain-only group, where each participant used a designated tool (or
  no tool in the latter) to write an essay. We conducted 3 sessions
  with the same group assignment for each participant. In the 4th
  session we asked LLM group participants to use no tools (we refer to
  them as LLM-to-Brain), and the Brain-only group participants were
  asked to use LLM (Brain-to-LLM). We recruited a total of 54
  participants for Sessions 1, 2, 3, and 18 participants among them
  completed session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to record
  participants' brain activity in order to assess their cognitive
  engagement and cognitive load, and to gain a deeper understanding of
  neural activations during the essay writing task.

      Randomization was at the individual participant level rather than
      at the class (or school) level.
    quote: >-
      "Participants were randomly assigned across the three following
      groups, balanced with respect to age and gender:" (p. 23)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Participants were randomly assigned across the three following
      groups, balanced with respect to age and gender:" (p. 23)

      2) "These 54 participants were between the ages of 18 to 39 years
      old (age M = 22.9, SD = 1.69) and all recruited from the following
      5 universities in greater Boston area:" (p. 22)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires that randomization be done at the class level
      (or stronger, school level), unless the intervention is explicitly
      1-on-1 tutoring. Here, the paper clearly states that participants
      (individual adults) were randomly assigned to tool conditions.

      Because the unit of randomization is individuals rather than
      classes or schools, the design does not satisfy the ERCT class-level
      randomization requirement.

      Criterion C is not met because assignment was individual-level,
      not class-level (or school-level).

      Outcomes were scored via teacher ratings and an internal AI judge,
      not via a standardized externally administered exam.
    quote: >-
      "We performed scoring with the help from the human teachers and an
      AI judge (a specially built AI agent)." (p. 2)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We performed scoring with the help from the human teachers and
      an AI judge (a specially built AI agent)." (p. 2)

      2) "We asked two English teachers to evaluate essays using different
      metrics like: Uniqueness, Vocabulary, Grammar, Organization, Content,
      Length and ChatGPT (a metric which says if a teacher thinks that essay
      was written with the help of LLM)." (p. 62)

      3) "All the topics were taken from SAT tests." (p. 25)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized exam-based assessment (a recognized
      standardized test administered and scored in a standardized way).

      The study uses SAT prompts as topics, but the outcome scoring is done
      through teacher ratings and a custom "AI judge". This is a bespoke
      research scoring pipeline rather than a standardized exam outcome.

      Criterion E is not met because assessment is not a standardized exam
      administration and scoring process.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured within short sessions rather than at least
      one academic term after the intervention began.
    quote: >-
      "Total duration of the study (Stages 1-5) was approximately 1h
      (60 minutes)." (p. 28)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The participants were instructed to pick a topic among the
      proposed prompts, and then to produce an essay based on the topic's
      assignment within a 20 minutes time limit." (p. 27)

      2) "Total duration of the study (Stages 1-5) was approximately 1h
      (60 minutes)." (p. 28)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcomes measured at least one academic term
      after the intervention begins (or term-long follow-up).

      The intervention and outcome measurement occur within short lab
      sessions: a 20-minute essay task within an approximately 1-hour
      protocol. The paper does not report term-delayed educational outcome
      measurement.

      Criterion T is not met because outcomes are measured immediately
      within short sessions, not after a term.

    explanation: >-
      The control condition and sample are clearly documented, including
      what the control group could and could not do.
    quote: >-
      "Brain-only Group (Group 3): Participants in this group were forbidden
      from using both LLM and any online websites for consultation."
      (p. 23)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Brain-only Group (Group 3): Participants in this group were forbidden
      from using both LLM and any online websites for consultation."
      (p. 23)

      2) "These 54 participants were between the ages of 18 to 39 years
      old (age M = 22.9, SD = 1.69) and all recruited from the following
      5 universities in greater Boston area:" (p. 22)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires clear documentation of the control condition and
      sufficient description of participants.

      The paper explicitly defines the Brain-only (no tools) condition and
      provides key participant demographics and recruitment context.

      Criterion D is met because the control condition and sample are
      described with operational detail.
  s:

    explanation: >-
      The study did not randomize at the school (site) level.
    quote: >-

      5 universities in greater Boston area:" (p. 22)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level randomization (schools or sites as
      the unit of assignment).

      Although participants were recruited from multiple universities, the
      paper states that individuals were randomly assigned to conditions.
      There is no indication that universities (or other sites) were
      randomized.

      Criterion S is not met because randomization was not school-level.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study was proposed, designed, executed, and analyzed by the
      author team, not by an independent evaluator.
    quote: >-
      "The study was proposed, designed, and executed by NK." (p. 143)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study was proposed, designed, and executed by NK." (p. 143)

      2) "NK and EH processed and analyzed both EEG and NLP data in this
      study." (p. 143)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires independent conduct, meaning implementation and
      evaluation are carried out (or overseen) by an organization
      independent of the intervention's designers.

      The author contributions section states that the study was proposed,
      designed, executed, and analyzed by the authors. The paper does not
      describe independent third-party oversight for running the study and
      analyzing outcomes.

      Criterion I is not met because the study was conducted and evaluated
      by the authors rather than an independent evaluator.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not measure outcomes over a full academic year, and
      criterion T is not met.
    quote: >-
      "The study took place over a period of 4 months, due to the scheduling
      and availability of the participants." (p. 23)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study took place over a period of 4 months, due to the scheduling
      and availability of the participants." (p. 23)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement spanning at least one
      academic year from intervention start.

      The paper reports a multi-session study occurring over about four
      months, which is shorter than an academic year. Also, per ERCT rules,
      if criterion T is not met then criterion Y is not met.

      Criterion Y is not met because the study is not year-long (and T is
      not met).
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Time-on-task is held constant across groups and the tested difference
      is tool access, not extra instructional time or budget.
    quote: >-
      "The participants were instructed to pick a topic among the proposed
      prompts, and then to produce an essay based on the topic's assignment
      within a 20 minutes time limit." (p. 27)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The participants were instructed to pick a topic among the
      proposed prompts, and then to produce an essay based on the topic's
      assignment within a 20 minutes time limit." (p. 27)

      2) "LLM Group (Group 1): Participants in this group were restricted to using
      OpenAI's GPT-4o as their sole resource of information for the essay writing
      task." (p. 23)

      3) "Search Engine Group (Group 2): Participants in this group could use any
      website to help them with their essay writing task, but ChatGPT or any other
      LLM was explicitly prohibited; all participants used Google as a browser of
      choice." (p. 23)

      4) "Brain-only Group (Group 3): Participants in this group were forbidden
      from using both LLM and any online websites for consultation." (p. 23)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B compares resources (time, budget, instructional inputs)
      between intervention and control, unless the extra resource is the
      treatment variable being tested.

      The study holds writing time constant (20 minutes) and varies access
      to external tools (GPT-4o, web search, or no tools). There is no
      indication of additional instructional time, tutoring, or materials
      beyond tool access.

      Because tool access is the intended treatment and time-on-task is
      matched, the resource-balance requirement is satisfied.

      Criterion B is met because groups are balanced on time and the
      resource difference is the intervention itself.

    explanation: >-
      No independent replication of this specific study was identified at
      the time of this ERCT check.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      (No quotes found regarding independent replication of this study.)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent reproduction by a different
      research team, published in a peer-reviewed venue.

      A targeted search by paper title, DOI, and arXiv identifier did not
      identify an independent replication study reproducing this protocol.

      Criterion R is not met because no independent replication was found.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not use standardized exams across all main subjects,
      and criterion E is not met.
    quote: >-
      "This study focuses on finding out the cognitive cost of using an LLM
      in the educational context of writing an essay." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This study focuses on finding out the cognitive cost of using an LLM
      in the educational context of writing an essay." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based outcomes across all main
      subjects (or an equivalent broad standardized outcome set).

      This study focuses on a single domain task (essay writing), and per
      ERCT rules, if criterion E is not met then criterion A is not met.

      Criterion A is not met because outcomes are not standardized exams
      across all core subjects (and E is not met).
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not track participants to graduation and criterion Y
      is not met.
    quote: >-
      "The study took place over a period of 4 months, due to the scheduling
      and availability of the participants." (p. 23)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The study took place over a period of 4 months, due to the scheduling
      and availability of the participants." (p. 23)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation.

      The paper reports a short multi-session study with no graduation
      follow-up. Per ERCT rules, if criterion Y is not met then criterion G
      is not met.

      A targeted search for subsequent graduation-tracking papers by the
      same authors describing this cohort did not identify such follow-up
      publications.

      Criterion G is not met because there is no graduation tracking and
      Y is not met.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper reports IRB approval but no public preregistration record
      was identified.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The protocol was approved by the IRB of MIT (ID 21070000428)."
      (p. 23)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires a publicly preregistered protocol with a
      registration date before data collection began (for example OSF,
      AsPredicted, ClinicalTrials.gov, or another public registry).

      The paper provides IRB approval information but does not provide a
      preregistration link or registry identifier. A targeted search using
      the paper title and author names did not identify a matching public
      preregistration record.

      Criterion P is not met because no public preregistration record was
      found.
