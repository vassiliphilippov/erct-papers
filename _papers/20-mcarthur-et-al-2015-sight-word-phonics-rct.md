abstract: >-
  Given the importance of effective treatments for children with reading
  impairment, paired with growing concern about the lack of scientific
  replication in psychological science, the authors used a randomised
  controlled trial (RCT) to test replicability of previously reported large
  effects of sight word and phonics training in poor readers. Participants aged
  7–12 were allocated to either phonics-then-sight word training or sight
  word-then-phonics training, with an 8-week no-training period as a
  within-subjects control. Findings indicated large, valid training effects on
  multiple reading measures, generally replicating prior work. This paper
  underscores that specific sight word training and phonics training both
  significantly benefit poor readers. The study calls for further RCTs
  comparing these approaches to a parallel untrained or alternative-trained
  control group to better isolate non-training gains.

criteria:
  c:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Although the randomisation was not at the class level, the study focused on
      individualized, at-home interventions, which meets the exception clause for
      personal teaching/tutoring.
    quote: >-
      “Children were allocated to groups using minimisation randomization
      (balanced 1:1)... All training was done online at home.” (Materials and
      Methods)
    analysis: >-
      This paper clearly states it is a randomised trial at the individual
      (student) level, using what the authors call ‘minimisation randomization’ for
      assigning children into two groups. The standard’s “C - Class-level RCT”
      criterion typically requires entire classes or schools to be randomised to
      avoid contamination. However, the standard provides an exception if the
      intervention is targeted personal tutoring or one-to-one teaching, meaning
      student-level randomisation can still satisfy ‘C’ if the intervention is
      individually delivered. Throughout the Methods section, the authors describe
      how children were individually allocated: “Children were allocated to groups
      using minimisation randomization… balanced 1:1…” (Materials and Methods).
      The training itself—both the sight word and phonics programs—was implemented
      individually in each child’s home. The paper clarifies that each participant
      “was asked to do five 30-minute sessions per week for 8 weeks…” on their own.
      Because this study uses an explicitly individual-level design and the
      activities are carried out privately (i.e., personal, computer-based training in
      the child’s home), the contamination risk that typically arises when students
      are randomised within a shared classroom is strongly mitigated. The standard’s
      exception language states that if an intervention is designed for
      individualized or “personal tutoring,” the class-level requirement can be
      relaxed, and the study qualifies as meeting the “C” criterion.
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They employed standardized exams such as the TOWRE and CC2 for reading,
      which satisfies the standard exam-based assessment requirement.
    quote: >-
      “We indexed nonword reading fluency using the Test of Word Reading Efficiency
      (TOWRE)... A child was asked to read as many nonwords as possible in 45 s.”
      (Methods)
    analysis: >-
      The paper uses multiple standardised tests to measure reading outcomes.
      For instance, the authors administered the Test of Word Reading Efficiency
      (TOWRE), which is widely recognised, and the Castles and Coltheart 2 (CC2)
      reading test (Castles et al., 2009). They also used the Test of Everyday Reading
      Comprehension (TERC). Each of these assessments is either a well-known
      standardized measure or a previously validated assessment with published
      norms. Using such standardized, externally developed measures ensures
      objectivity and comparability. Hence, the criterion “E - Exam-based assessment”
      is met because the authors rely on recognized reading tests (e.g., TOWRE) and a
      well-documented reading battery (CC2) rather than a bespoke tool only
      validated within this study.
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They delivered 16 consecutive weeks of active reading training, meeting the
      approximate 3–4-month term threshold.
    quote: >-
      “It took 6 months for a child to complete the study… [which included] 8 weeks no
      training, 8 weeks phonics training (or sight word training), then 8 weeks of the
      other training.” (Methods)
    analysis: >-
      The “T - Term Duration” criterion requires an intervention lasting at least one
      academic term (usually 3–4 months). In this paper, each group received 16 weeks of
      active training in total: an 8-week block of one treatment (phonics or sight word),
      immediately followed by an 8-week block of the other. Since the entire study from the
      start of training to the end lasted 16 weeks of instruction for each participant, that
      amounts to roughly four months of training interventions (not counting the initial
      8-week no-training period). Consequently, the study meets the “Term Duration”
      requirement.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They used a within-subject no-training phase to index gains unrelated to the
      interventions and provided full baseline and demographic details for those
      participants in that control period.
    quote: >-
      “After 8 weeks of no training, they returned to do the outcome measures (Test 2)
      to index ‘non-treatment gains’… [We documented] T1–T2 changes in reading measures.”
      (Methods)
    analysis: >-
      The “D - Documented Control Group” criterion requires detailed demographic and
      baseline information about the control group, ensuring we can compare them
      properly to the intervention group. In this paper, the authors created a
      within-subject control phase (8 weeks of ‘no training’) for each participant,
      measuring T1 to T2 as a baseline of test–retest or maturational gains. The
      authors provide demographic details and baseline reading scores in Table 2, and
      describe precisely that during these 8 weeks, “children did no training” beyond
      continuing their usual schooling. Hence, the control condition is fully documented.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They randomised individual children rather than assigning entire schools, so the
      stronger school-level randomisation criterion is not satisfied.
    quote: >-
      “Children were allocated to groups using minimisation randomization (balanced 1:1)
      for age… They were individually assigned.” (Methods)
    analysis: >-
      Level 2’s “S - School-level RCT” demands that entire schools, rather than
      individual classes (or students), be randomly assigned. This paper does not assign
      schools or classes, but rather individually randomises children. Hence, it does not
      meet the S criterion for a higher-level (school-wide) randomisation.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They focused exclusively on reading outcomes, without evaluating other school
      subjects.
    quote: >-
      “We used the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE) … The CC2 reading test … No
      mention of other academic subjects.” (Methods)
    analysis: >-
      The “A - AllExams” criterion requires measuring impact across all main subjects
      taught in school (or a rationale if the intervention is very specialized). This
      design solely focuses on reading outcomes: reading fluency, reading accuracy, and
      reading comprehension. There is no indication that they assessed other subjects.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They conducted two consecutive 8-week interventions (total 16 weeks), which is
      less than a full school year.
    quote: >-
      “Since it took 6 months… 8 weeks no training, 8 weeks of phonics, 8 weeks of
      sight word training…” (Methods)
    analysis: >-
      The “Y - Year Duration” criterion requires that the intervention last at least one
      full academic year, typically 9–10 months of active implementation. In the paper,
      each group completed 16 total weeks of training over roughly 6 calendar months,
      which is significantly shorter than a full academic year.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Although they tracked a no-training period, they did not balance any extra time or
      budget for the control condition, as required for B.
    quote: >-
      “Children were asked to do five 30-minute sessions per week… The control period
      involved no training, with no mention of matching extra resources.” (Methods)
    analysis: >-
      The “B - Balanced Control Group” criterion requires that any additional time or
      budget given to the intervention group must also be matched in the control group.
      In this study, there is no parallel group receiving a matched budget or matched
      time. Each child experienced a no-training phase as their own control, and no extra
      resources were provided to balance the intervention.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      They stopped outcome measurement after 16 weeks of training and did not track
      students through the end of their school level.
    quote: >-
      “Since it took 6 months… the last child completed the last test session (Test 4)
      in December 2013.” (Methods)
    analysis: >-
      The “G - Graduation Tracking” criterion requires that the researchers monitor
      participants’ progress through to graduation from their current school level.
      This paper follows each child for about 6 months total, from pre-training through
      16 weeks of reading intervention, but does not track them beyond that.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Though it replicates prior work by largely the same team, no external research
      group replicated the results in a separate study.
    quote: >-
      “We used randomised controlled trial… to replicate a quasi-randomised trial of sight
      word and phonics training...” (Introduction)
    analysis: >-
      The “R - Reproduced” criterion calls for an independent replication by a different
      research team in a different context. While the authors mention that this study is
      itself a replication of McArthur et al. (2013a), it is essentially the same core
      research group seeking to confirm their earlier findings with an RCT, and thus does
      not meet the criterion.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      There is no indication that an external, independent team conducted or oversaw the
      study apart from the authors who designed the training approach.
    quote: >-
      “We would like to thank all the children and parents… We would like to thank Shane
      Davis… and all the people at Literacy Planet… [Researchers from Macquarie University]
      provided the design and analysis.” (Acknowledgments)
    analysis: >-
      The “I - Independent Conduct” criterion requires that the study be carried out by
      people not involved in designing the intervention. In this paper, the main authors
      partnered with Literacy Planet for the training software, but the study was
      conducted entirely by the research team, and there is no external evaluator.
  p:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      They state their ANZCTR registration (12608000454370), indicating formal
      pre-registration.
    quote: >-
      “This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials
      Registry (ANZCTR; 12608000454370).” (Methods)
    analysis: >-
      The “P - Pre-Registered” criterion requires an officially recorded pre-registration
      of hypotheses and methods prior to data collection. The authors explicitly mention
      their registration with ANZCTR, satisfying the criterion.
