abstract: >-
  Given the importance of effective treatments for children with 
  reading impairment, paired with growing concern about the lack of 
  scientific replication in psychological science, the aim of this 
  study was to replicate a quasi‑randomised trial of sight word and 
  phonics training using a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. 
  One group of poor readers (N = 41) did 8 weeks of phonics training 
  (i.e., phonological decoding) and then 8 weeks of sight word training 
  (i.e., whole‑word recognition). A second group did the reverse order 
  of training. Sight word and phonics training each had a large and 
  significant valid treatment effect on trained irregular words and 
  word reading fluency. In addition, combined sight word and phonics 
  training had a moderate and significant valid treatment effect on 
  nonword reading accuracy and fluency. These findings demonstrate the 
  reliability of both phonics and sight word training in treating poor 
  readers in an era where the importance of scientific reliability is 
  under close scrutiny.

    explanation: >
      Although randomization was not at the class level, the intervention
      was a fully individualized, at-home, computer-based program,
      satisfying the personal tutoring exception in the ERCT standard.

      “Children were allocated to groups using minimisation randomization
      (balanced 1:1 for age, CC2 nonword reading, CC2 irregular word
      reading; executed using MINIMPY; Saghaei, 2011), which is considered
      the most appropriate sequence allocation procedure for trials
      comprising fewer than 100 participants.” (p. 10)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Children were allocated to groups using minimisation
      randomization (balanced 1:1 for age, CC2 nonword reading, CC2
      irregular word reading; executed using MINIMPY; Saghaei, 2011),
      which is considered the most appropriate sequence allocation
      procedure for trials comprising fewer than 100 participants.”
      (p. 10)

      2) “All training was done online at home.” (p. 10)

      3) “Children were asked to do five 30-minute sight-word training
      sessions per week for 8 weeks in their homes.” (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      This paper clearly states it is a randomized trial at the individual
      (student) level using “minimisation randomization.” However, the
      ERCT “Class-level RCT” criterion includes an exception for personal
      tutoring or one-to-one instruction. The intervention here was
      entirely individualized: children completed training at home, using
      online software, with no shared group or classroom setting. The
      activities were performed privately, and there was no opportunity
      for cross-contamination between groups. Therefore, this qualifies
      under the standard’s exception clause for personal tutoring.

      Final sentence explaining criterion C is met because this was an
      individualized, home-based intervention that avoids contamination
      risk, thus qualifying under the exception clause.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “We indexed nonword reading fluency using the Test of Word Reading
         Efficiency (TOWRE) nonword subtest (Torgeson, Wagner & Rashotte, 1999).”
         (p. 9) 

      2) “This was tested with the TOWRE sight word subtest that comprised 104
         words that increased in difficulty (Torgeson, Wagner & Rashotte, 1999).”
         (p. 9) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study used the TOWRE subtests, which are widely recognized standardized
      exams for both word and nonword reading fluency, satisfying the ERCT ‘E -
      Exam-based Assessment’ requirement for objective, comparable measures.

      Final sentence explaining criterion E is met because standardized TOWRE exams
      were used to assess reading outcomes.
    explanation: >
      The study employed the standardized TOWRE subtests for reading fluency,
      meeting the exam‑based assessment requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Group 1 did 8 weeks of phonics training (and then Test 3) followed by 
         8 weeks of sight word training (and then Test 4). Group 2 did the same 
         training in the reverse order.” (p. 4) 

      2) “Since it took 6 months for a child to complete the study, the last 
         child completed the last test session (Test 4) in December 2013.” (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Each child underwent two 8‑week intervention phases (16 weeks total), with 
      final outcome measurement at Test 4, and participation spanning 24 weeks 
      (~6 months), exceeding the minimum one‑term (~3–4 months) requirement of the 
      ERCT ‘T - Term Duration’ criterion.

      Final sentence explaining criterion T is met because outcomes were measured
      at least one full academic term after intervention start.
    explanation: >
      Outcome assessments occurred after at least 16 weeks of training (and within a
      6‑month participation period), exceeding the one‑term minimum requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “After 8 weeks of no training, they returned to do the outcome measures 
         (Test 2) to index ‘non-treatment gains’.” (p. 4) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      A within‑subject no‑training period was used instead of a separate control
      group. This does not satisfy the ERCT ‘D - Documented Control Group’ criterion,
      which requires a distinct, well‑documented control condition.

      Final sentence explaining criterion D is not met because no separate control
      group with its own documented characteristics was provided.
    explanation: >
      The study lacked a separate control group, relying on a within‑subject baseline,
      thus failing the documented control group requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Children were allocated to groups using minimisation randomization …”
         (p. 10) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      Randomization occurred at the individual child level, not among schools.
      The ERCT ‘S - School-level RCT’ criterion is therefore not met.

      Final sentence explaining criterion S is not met because schools were not
      randomized to conditions.
    explanation: >
      The study randomized individual children rather than entire schools, so the
      school‑level RCT requirement is not met.

         complete the required amount of training, in which case the parents were 
         contacted …” (p. 6) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The authors both designed and implemented the intervention, with no independent
      external evaluator. The ERCT ‘I - Independent Conduct’ criterion requires 
      third‑party oversight, which is not evident here.

      Final sentence explaining criterion I is not met because the same team conducted
      and assessed the study without independent oversight.
    explanation: >
      The intervention was conducted and monitored by the same team that designed it,
      failing the independent conduct requirement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “Since it took 6 months for a child to complete the study ...” (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Participants were followed for approximately 24 weeks (6 months), shorter than
      the full academic year (~9–10 months) required by the ERCT ‘Y - Year Duration’
      criterion.

      Final sentence explaining criterion Y is not met because tracking did not span
      a full academic year.
    explanation: >
      Participants were observed for about 6 months, not a full academic year, so the
      year‑duration requirement is not met.

      2) “Group 1 did 8 weeks of phonics training ... followed by 8 weeks of sight word
         training. Group 2 did the same training in the reverse order.” (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The training groups received extra instructional time that the control period did
      not have, violating the ERCT ‘B - Balanced Resources’ requirement for equal time
      and resources in control conditions.

      Final sentence explaining criterion B is not met because the control condition
      received no equivalent intervention or resource.
    explanation: >
      The control condition had no training or additional support, so resources were 
      not balanced.

      None.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Although this paper is a replication of a prior trial, it was conducted by the 
      same research team. No independent replication by a different team in a new context
      is reported, so the ERCT ‘R - Reproduced’ criterion is not met.

      Final sentence explaining criterion R is not met because no independent external
      replication is documented.
    explanation: >
      No independent research team has published a replication of this trial, so 
      reproducibility is not established.

      3) “This was tested using the Test of Everyday Reading Comprehension (TERC) ...”
         (p. 9) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      All outcomes are reading‑specific. No assessments in mathematics, science, or
      other core subjects are included, failing the ERCT ‘A - All-subject Exams’
      criterion.

      Final sentence explaining criterion A is not met because only reading outcomes
      were assessed.
    explanation: >
      The study measured only reading skills without assessing other core subjects, so
      the all-subject exams requirement is not met.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Participants were tracked only during the intervention period (∼6 months).
      No follow‑up through graduation is reported, so the ERCT ‘G - Graduation
      Tracking’ criterion is not met.

      Final sentence explaining criterion G is not met because graduation tracking
      was not conducted.
    explanation: >
      Participants were followed for about 6 months, with no data collection continuing
      through graduation, failing the graduation tracking requirement.

         Registry (ANZCTR; 12608000454370).” (p. 1) 

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ANZCTR registry shows the trial was registered on 15 September 2008
      (prospectively) — well before recruitment of participants began in January 2011.
      This confirms that the study protocol was pre-registered prior to data collection.

      Final sentence explaining criterion P is met because the trial was registered
      before data collection started, ensuring a pre-specified protocol.
    explanation: >
      The trial was prospectively registered long before participants were enrolled,
      satisfying the pre-registered protocol requirement.
