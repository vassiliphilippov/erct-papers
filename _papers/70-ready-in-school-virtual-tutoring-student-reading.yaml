abstract: >-
  This paper describes a 12-week cluster randomized controlled trial
  that examined the efficacy of BookNook, a virtual tutoring platform
  focused on reading. Cohorts of first- through fourth-grade students
  attending six Rocketship public charter schools in Northern
  California were randomly assigned within grades to receive BookNook.
  Intent-to-Treat models indicate that students in cohorts assigned to
  BookNook outperformed their control-group peers by roughly 0.05 SDs.
  Given the substantial variability in usage rates among students
  enrolled in BookNook cohorts, we also leveraged Treatment-on-the-
  Treated approaches. These models suggest that students who completed
  10 or more BookNook sessions experienced a reading advantage of 0.08
  SDs, while those who completed 20 or more sessions—the recommended
  dosage—experienced a 0.26 SD developmental advantage.

    explanation: >-
      Cohorts (cluster groups of roughly 20–30 students) were randomly
      assigned to treatment or control within each school and grade,
      satisfying class-level cluster randomization.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "This paper describes a 12-week cluster randomized controlled
      trial that examined the efficacy of BookNook, a virtual tutoring
      platform focused on reading." (p. 2)

      2) "Rocketship organizes students into same-grade cohorts
      containing roughly 20-30 students each, usually resulting in three
      to four cohorts per grade, depending on enrollments." (p. 9)

      3) "Within each school and grade, we randomly assigned all cohorts
      to treatment or control groups." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires randomization at the class level (or stronger)
      to reduce contamination, with an exception for tutoring/personal
      teaching. This study is explicitly described as a "cluster
      randomized controlled trial" and specifies that the randomization
      unit is the "cohort" within each school and grade.

      The cohorts are described as roughly 20–30 students, indicating a
      class-like instructional grouping rather than random assignment of
      individual students within the same classroom/cohort. The quoted
      randomization statement confirms assignment of intact cohorts to
      treatment vs. control.

      Final: Criterion C is met because intact student cohorts were
      randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions. 
  e:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured using NWEA MAP, a standardized assessment
      administered as part of the schools’ regular assessment program.
    quote: >-
      "Outcome. MAP is a computer-adaptive assessment that measures
      student academic growth, producing scores that are vertically
      equated using the Rasch unit (RIT) scale." (p. 11)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Outcome. MAP is a computer-adaptive assessment that measures
      student academic growth, producing scores that are vertically
      equated using the Rasch unit (RIT) scale." (p. 11)

      2) "Rocketship Schools administers the MAP assessments three times
      each year—Fall, Winter, and Spring—as part of its regular
      assessment program." (p. 12)

      3) "In norming studies, MAP test–retest reliabilities ranged from
      .73 to .89, and concurrent validity with elementary-level state
      reading tests ranged from .58 to .83 (NWEA, 2019)." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires outcomes be measured using standardized,
      widely recognized exam-based assessments (not researcher-created
      tests tailored to the intervention). The paper clearly identifies
      MAP as the outcome assessment, describes it as vertically equated
      on a standard scale (RIT), and notes that Rocketship administers
      MAP on a routine schedule (Fall/Winter/Spring) as part of its
      regular program.

      The paper further cites reliability and concurrent validity
      evidence from MAP norming studies, which supports that MAP is a
      standardized, externally developed assessment rather than a custom
      measure created for this experiment.

      Final: Criterion E is met because student outcomes were measured
      using the standardized MAP assessment administered routinely by the
      schools. 
  t:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention began in late January 2023 and the follow-up MAP
      assessment occurred in mid-May 2023, which is approximately a full
      academic term after the intervention start.
    quote: >-
      "The roughly 12-week implementation began in late January, 2023
      and concluded in early May, 2023." (p. 10)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The roughly 12-week implementation began in late January, 2023
      and concluded in early May, 2023." (p. 10)

      2) "The Spring administration took place in mid-May, after the
      conclusion of the study." (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcomes be measured at least one academic
      term after the intervention begins (typically about 3–4 months).
      The intervention started in late January 2023 and concluded in
      early May 2023, and the spring assessment occurred in mid-May.

      Late January to mid-May is roughly 3.5 months, which aligns with
      a term-length interval from start to follow-up measurement.

      Final: Criterion T is met because the start-to-follow-up interval
      is approximately one full academic term. 
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control condition is described as continuing Rocketship’s
      regular Learning Lab reading supports, and the paper reports clear
      treatment/control sample sizes and baseline equivalence checks.
    quote: >-
      "Control cohorts of students within the same grade and school
      continued to receive the reading supports and activities that
      Rocketship normally provides." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Control cohorts of students within the same grade and school
      continued to receive the reading supports and activities that
      Rocketship normally provides." (p. 3)

      2) "Our final analytic sample includes 77 student cohorts (n=42
      treatment, 35 control) containing 1,777 first- through fourth-
      grade students (n=959 treatment, 818 control)..." (p. 11)

      3) "We begin with results from the models establishing pre-
      treatment equivalency between treatment/control cohorts (see
      Table 1). Fortunately, we find no statistically significant or
      substantively meaningful differences in terms of baseline student
      academic and socio-demographic characteristics." (p. 17)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires that the control group be sufficiently
      documented, including what the control group received and enough
      information to evaluate baseline comparability. The paper clearly
      states the control condition: continuing Rocketship’s usual reading
      supports and activities.

      The paper also reports the sample sizes by condition at both the
      cohort and student levels and explicitly describes baseline
      equivalence analyses (Table 1), concluding there are no meaningful
      pre-treatment differences.

      Final: Criterion D is met because the control condition and
      treatment/control group composition and baseline equivalence are
      clearly documented. 
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Randomization occurred within schools at the cohort level rather
      than assigning entire schools to treatment versus control.
    quote: >-
      "Within each school and grade, we randomly assigned all cohorts to
      treatment or control groups." (p. 9)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The implementation involved first- through fourth-grade
      students enrolled in six Rocketship public charter schools in
      Northern California." (p. 9)

      2) "Within each school and grade, we randomly assigned all cohorts
      to treatment or control groups." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires school-level randomization (schools assigned
      to intervention vs. control). Although six schools participated,
      the random assignment occurred "within each school and grade"
      across cohorts, not across whole schools.

      Because assignment did not occur at the school level, the study
      does not satisfy the school-level RCT requirement.

      Final: Criterion S is not met because randomization was conducted
      at the cohort-within-school level rather than the school level. 
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper does not explicitly state that the study was conducted by
      an independent third party separate from the intervention’s
      designers/provider.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "In this paper, we describe the results of a short-cycle cluster
      randomized controlled trial that examined the impact of BookNook on
      student reading outcomes." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires explicit, quotable evidence that the evaluation
      was conducted independently from the intervention designers (e.g.,
      an external evaluator with no role in developing the program).

      The paper describes the design and results of the trial but does
      not include a statement clarifying the relationship between the
      evaluators (the paper’s authors) and the intervention provider or
      designers (BookNook), nor does it state that an independent
      evaluation organization conducted the study.

      Final: Criterion I is not met because the paper does not document
      independent third-party conduct of the evaluation. 
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      Outcomes were measured from late January 2023 to mid-May 2023,
      which is far less than 75% of an academic year after the
      intervention began.
    quote: >-
      "The Winter MAP administration occurred in December prior to the
      BookNook implementation, and the Spring administration took place
      in mid-May, after the conclusion of the study." (p. 12)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The roughly 12-week implementation began in late January, 2023
      and concluded in early May, 2023." (p. 10)

      2) "As such, the actual intervention period was 10 weeks, with full
      treatment exposure calculated as 20-30 BookNook sessions." (p. 10)

      3) "The Winter MAP administration occurred in December prior to the
      BookNook implementation, and the Spring administration took place
      in mid-May, after the conclusion of the study." (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcomes be measured at least 75% of an
      academic year after the intervention begins. Here, the intervention
      began in late January 2023, concluded in early May 2023, and the
      spring MAP follow-up was administered in mid-May.

      The time from late January to mid-May is roughly 3.5 months, well
      below 75% of a typical 9–10 month academic year, and the paper also
      indicates the actual intervention period was only 10 weeks.

      Final: Criterion Y is not met because the follow-up window is far
      shorter than 75% of an academic year. 
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Both groups used the same scheduled Learning Lab time, and the
      added tutoring/platform resources are the core treatment being
      tested rather than an unbalanced add-on of extra instructional
      time.
    quote: >-
      "Students enrolled in treatment cohorts were to receive BookNook
      tutoring during their Learning Lab period two to three times per
      week for 30 minutes per session." (p. 9)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Rocketship students experience four content blocks each day:
      Humanities, STEM, Enrichment, and Learning Lab." (p. 9)

      2) "Students enrolled in treatment cohorts were to receive BookNook
      tutoring during their Learning Lab period two to three times per
      week for 30 minutes per session." (p. 9)

      3) "Students in cohorts assigned to the control condition would
      continue with the regular reading supports provided during Learning
      Lab." (p. 9)

      4) "Most of the participating virtual tutors had previously taught
      K-12 academic subjects, with over three years of tutoring or
      teaching experience on average." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B requires that treatment and control have balanced time
      and resources unless the study is explicitly testing additional
      resources as the treatment variable (in which case business-as-
      usual controls can be appropriate).

      Time: Both treatment and control occur during the same scheduled
      "Learning Lab" block, indicating no additional instructional time
      is added beyond the normal school schedule for the treatment group.

      Resources: BookNook includes additional resources (a synchronous
      platform and virtual tutors). The paper makes clear that these
      tutoring resources are the intervention itself (i.e., a substitution
      of BookNook tutoring for the regular reading supports within the
      same time block), not an optional add-on layered on top of extra
      time.

      Under the ERCT decision rule, even though extra resources are
      present (tutors/platform), they are integral to what is being
      tested (the provision of BookNook tutoring during Learning Lab
      versus business-as-usual supports during Learning Lab). Therefore,
      the design can still meet Criterion B.

      Final: Criterion B is met because treatment and control use the
      same Learning Lab time and the additional tutoring resources are
      the core treatment being evaluated. 
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      No independent replication of this specific BookNook Rocketship RCT
      by a different research team was identified, and none is reported
      in the paper.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Our current work is among the few causal studies to estimate
      the impact of virtual tutoring structured into the school day."
      (p. 7)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires evidence that a different research team
      independently replicated the same intervention/evaluation in a
      different context and published it in a peer-reviewed journal.

      The paper does not report that this specific BookNook RCT was
      replicated elsewhere, and it frames the work as being among "the
      few causal studies" in this area. An internet search for
      peer-reviewed, independent replications of this specific RCT did
      not identify a qualifying replication study.

      Final: Criterion R is not met because no independent, peer-reviewed
      replication of this specific RCT is documented or was found. 
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study uses a standardized reading assessment (MAP Reading) but
      does not assess outcomes across all core subjects.
    quote: >-
      "We use reading results from the Winter administration as our
      baseline measure and reading scores from the Spring administration
      as the follow-up (post-implementation) outcome." (p. 12)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We use reading results from the Winter administration as our
      baseline measure and reading scores from the Spring administration
      as the follow-up (post-implementation) outcome." (p. 12)

      2) "Outcome. MAP is a computer-adaptive assessment that measures
      student academic growth, producing scores that are vertically
      equated using the Rasch unit (RIT) scale." (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exams across all main subjects,
      and Criterion E must be met (it is met here because MAP is
      standardized). However, the outcomes analyzed in this study are
      explicitly MAP reading results, with no corresponding outcome
      reporting for other core subjects (e.g., math, science, writing).

      Therefore, the study does not satisfy the all-subject exams
      requirement.

      Final: Criterion A is not met because the paper reports standardized
      exam outcomes for reading only, not for all core subjects. 
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study does not track students through graduation, and per ERCT
      rules graduation tracking cannot be met when year-duration (Y) is
      not met.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The Spring administration took place in mid-May, after the
      conclusion of the study." (p. 12)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires follow-up tracking through graduation from the
      relevant educational stage, and ERCT rules specify that if Criterion
      Y is not met, then Criterion G is not met.

      This study follows students only through the spring assessment in
      mid-May 2023 after a late-January 2023 start. The paper does not
      describe any longer-term follow-up of the same cohort into later
      grades or through any graduation milestone. An internet search for
      follow-up publications by the same authors reporting graduation
      tracking for this cohort did not identify any such paper.

      Final: Criterion G is not met because the study ends in spring 2023,
      does not track to graduation, and Criterion Y is not met. 
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper provides no registry identifier or link to a pre-
      registered protocol, and no external pre-registration record was
      found for this study.
    quote: null
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      (No relevant quotes found in the paper indicating a registry, a
      registration ID/link, or a pre-registration date.)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires that the study protocol be pre-registered
      before data collection begins, with a verifiable registry record
      (e.g., OSF, AEA RCT Registry) and appropriate timing.

      The paper contains no mention of pre-registration (no registry name,
      link, or ID). Searches for an associated public pre-registration
      record tied to this study (e.g., by title, authors, DOI, and
      intervention name) did not identify a verifiable pre-registered
      protocol.

      Final: Criterion P is not met because no pre-registration evidence
      is reported in the paper or found via registry searches.
