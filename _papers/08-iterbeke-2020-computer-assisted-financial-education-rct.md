abstract: >-
  Using a computer-based learning environment, the present paper
  studied the effects of adaptive instruction and elaborated
  feedback on the learning outcomes of secondary school students in a
  financial education program. We randomly assigned schools to four
  conditions on a crossing of two factors: the type of instruction
  (uniform or adaptive) and feedback (verification or elaborated). A
  total of 1,177 students in 32 schools completed the program in
  ability groups in the classroom. The results showed that the
  program, on average, enhanced the financial knowledge of students by
  almost half of a standard deviation. No significant changes in
  students' financial behavior were found. Despite the promise of
  adaptive practices to address the individual needs of students, we
  observed no additional learning gains associated with adaptive
  instruction and elaborated feedback. A marginally significant
  heterogeneous effect for gender was reported, where girls were
  negatively affected by adaptive instruction. Moreover, despite our
  sample included more students from a favorable socioeconomic status,
  the adaptive practices seemed to lower the motivation level. Hence,
  while no information on the time spent on the instruction and
  feedback was retrieved, the latter finding suggested that the
  practices may have been perceived as burdensome by students, thereby
  rendering them ineffective.

      The study randomized entire schools to treatment conditions,
      meeting the class-level RCT criterion.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “We randomly assigned schools to four conditions on a crossing
      of two factors: the type of instruction (uniform or adaptive) and
      feedback (verification or elaborated).” (p. 2)

      2) “Randomization was conducted at the school level in order to
      avoid contamination effects.” (p. 4)

      3) “A total of 1,177 students in 32 schools completed the program
      in ability groups in the classroom.” (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires randomization at the class level (or
      stronger, like school level) to prevent contamination. This paper
      explicitly states that randomization was performed at the school
      level to avoid such contamination. Assigning entire schools to
      conditions is a stronger design than class-level randomization and
      thus satisfies this criterion.

      Criterion C (Class-level RCT) is met because randomization
      occurred at the school level.

    explanation: >-
      The study used researcher-designed tests, not standardized exams,
      to measure financial proficiency.
    quote: >-
      “The pre-treatment test was designed as a computer-aided
      multiple-choice test... eight questions that referred directly to
      the material and measured students' financial proficiency.” (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The pre-treatment test was designed as a computer-aided
      multiple-choice test.” (p. 5)

      2) “The test included several questions on students' demographics
      and eight questions that referred directly to the material and
      measured students' financial proficiency.” (p. 5)

      3) “Financial proficiency can be decomposed into financial
      knowledge and financial behavior. We assessed financial knowledge
      by five questions... Two questions for the latter three financial
      concepts were taken from Lusardi and Mitchell (2011).” (p. 5-6)

      4) “The financial proficiency questions were constructed by
      rephrasing and using adjustment of numbers of the pre-test
      questions.” (p. 6)

      5) “The pre- and post-treatment questions on financial proficiency
      were face validated by two senior teachers in the research team
      and showed good construct validity.” (footnote 4, p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires the use of standardized, widely recognized
      exams. The paper states the tests were "designed as a
      computer-aided multiple-choice test" by the researchers,
      including questions referring "directly to the material". While
      some questions were adapted from prior literature (Lusardi &
      Mitchell, 2011), the overall assessment was custom-built for the
      study, rephrasing pre-test questions for the post-test, and
      face-validated by teachers, not externally standardized. No
      mention is made of using a national or state-wide standardized
      test.

      Criterion E (Exam-based Assessment) is not met as the assessment
      was primarily researcher-developed, not a standardized exam.

      The intervention consisted of four 50-minute lectures, much
      shorter than a full academic term.
    quote: >-
      “The learning material was designed as four lectures of 50 minutes
      in the form of a computer-assisted learning path.” (p. 5)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “The learning material was designed as four lectures of 50
      minutes in the form of a computer-assisted learning path.” (p. 5)

      2) “To measure the short-term impact of the financial education
      program, a post-treatment computer-aided multiple-choice test was
      administered at the start of the last lecture...” (p. 6)

      3) “Approximately four weeks after the lectures, students in the
      treatment schools completed the second post-treatment test as a
      homework assignment.” (p. 8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcomes to be measured at least one full
      academic term (typically 3-4 months) after the intervention begins.
      The intervention here consisted of only four 50-minute lectures,
      totaling roughly 3.3 hours. The primary outcome was measured
      shortly after these sessions, although a second post-test was
      given four weeks later as homework. Neither the intervention
      duration nor the measurement point meets the minimum term length
      requirement.

      Criterion T (Term Duration) is not met because the intervention and
      primary outcome measurement occurred over a period much shorter
      than an academic term.

      The paper documents the control group's characteristics, size, and
      conditions in detail, including baseline scores in Table III.
    quote: >-
      “Table III presents the school and student characteristics for the
      final sample involving 1,177 students, 94 classes, and 32 schools
      which were randomly assigned to one of the conditions.” (p. 9)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) “In order to examine the program effectiveness... we designed
      four conditions, i.e., one control condition and three
      experimental conditions. The control condition did not receive the
      financial education program.” (p. 4)

      2) “Teachers in the control schools obtained the material after
      their students took the pre- and first post-treatment test as an
      incentive to comply with the prescribed instructions.” (p. 8)

      3) “Table III presents the school and student characteristics for
      the final sample involving 1,177 students, 94 classes, and 32
      schools which were randomly assigned to one of the conditions. ...
      Overall, the characteristics are relatively balanced across
      conditions.” (p. 9)

      4) Table III, Column (1) provides data for the Control group,
      including school characteristics (private, class size, grade),
      student background (track, gender, age, language, math grade,
      importance of financial literacy), and pre-financial scores
      (proficiency, knowledge, behavior). (p. 10)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires clear documentation of the control group's
      size, characteristics, baseline performance, and conditions. The
      paper specifies a control group that received no intervention and
      whose teachers received materials only after the study. Table III
      provides detailed descriptive statistics for the control group (N =
      312 students in 9 schools), covering demographics, school
      context, and baseline financial proficiency scores, comparing them
      to the treatment groups. This level of detail allows assessment of
      baseline comparability.

      Criterion D (Documented Control Group) is met as the control group
      is clearly defined and its characteristics are well-documented.

      2) “We randomly assigned schools to four conditions on a crossing
      of two factors...” (p. 2)

      3) “In total, 32 schools ... participated in the final sample.” (p.
      5, Table III)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the school level, meaning
      entire schools are assigned to conditions. The paper explicitly
      states, “Randomization was conducted at the school level” and “We
      randomly assigned schools to four conditions”. The sample involved
      32 distinct schools. This design meets the standard for a
      school-level RCT, which is considered stronger than class-level
      RCTs for capturing real-world effects.

      Criterion S (School-level RCT) is met because the randomization
      unit was the school.

      3) “We took care in designing our study to prevent potentially
      confounding influences.” (p. 15)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires the study to be conducted independently from
      the intervention designers to reduce bias. The CRediT statement
      clearly shows the authors (Iterbeke, De Witte, Schelfhout) were
      responsible for conceptualization, methodology, investigation, and
      analysis. They designed the learning material and the study
      itself. There is no mention of an external or third-party team
      conducting the implementation or evaluation. The acknowledgements
      thank individuals for research assistance but not for independent
      conduct of the trial.

      Criterion I (Independent Conduct) is not met because the same team
      designed, implemented, and analyzed the intervention.

      The intervention involved four 50-minute sessions and a four-week
      follow-up, falling short of the required full academic year.

      2) “Approximately four weeks after the lectures, students in the
      treatment schools completed the second post-treatment test as a

      3) “To measure the long-term impact, a second post-treatment test
      was offered... and included similar financial proficiency questions
      as the other two tests.” (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcome measurement at least one full academic
      year (~9-10 months) after the intervention starts. The
      intervention itself was brief (four 50-min sessions). While a
      second post-test was administered "approximately four weeks after
      the lectures" to measure "long-term impact", this four-week
      follow-up is significantly shorter than a full academic year. The
      paper does not mention any longer-term tracking.

      Criterion Y (Year Duration) is not met as the follow-up measurement
      occurred only about four weeks after the short intervention, not a
      full year.

      The control group did not receive the financial education program

      3) “Teachers in the control schools obtained the material after
      their students took the pre- and first post-treatment test...” (p.
      8)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B requires that if the intervention adds educational time
      or resources, the control group must receive a comparable amount of
      "business as usual" or alternative activities to ensure balance,
      unless the extra resources are the explicit treatment variable. The
      intervention involved four 50-minute sessions using a specific
      computer-assisted program. The paper states the control group "did
      not receive the financial education program" and teachers only got
      materials afterward. There's no mention of the control group
      receiving alternative activities or equivalent instructional time
      during those 200 minutes. The intervention itself (adaptive
      instruction/feedback) was the focus, not the provision of extra
      time/resources per se. Therefore, the ~3.3 hours of specialized
      instruction for the treatment groups were not balanced for the
      control group.

      Criterion B (Balanced Control Group) is not met because the
      treatment group received ~200 minutes of specific instruction that
      was not matched with equivalent time/resources for the control
      group.

      Relevant Quotes:

      None mentioning replication were found in the paper. The authors
      cite related literature but not independent replications of this
      trial.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires the study's main findings to be independently
      replicated by a different research team in a different context,
      published in a peer-reviewed journal. The paper itself does not
      cite any such replication. A quick check doesn't reveal obvious
      published replications by independent teams focusing on this
      specific intervention (adaptive instruction and elaborated
      feedback in a computer-assisted financial literacy program for
      Belgian 8th/9th graders with this design). While other studies
      examine financial literacy or adaptive learning, they do not
      constitute direct replications of this particular experiment.

      Criterion R (Reproduced) is not met as there is no evidence of
      independent replication.

      strategies.” (p. 5-6)

      2) “...the present paper studied the effects of adaptive
      instruction and elaborated feedback on the learning outcomes of
      secondary school students in a financial education program.” (p.
      2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires assessment across all main subjects using
      standardized exams, unless a focus on a specific area is justified.
      Firstly, Criterion E (standardized exams) was not met, which
      automatically means Criterion A cannot be met. Secondly, even if
      standardized exams were used, the study focused exclusively on
      "financial proficiency," broken down into "financial knowledge" and
      "financial behavior". There is no mention of assessing outcomes in
      other core subjects like mathematics, language, or science. The
      context is financial education, a specific domain, not general
      academic achievement across the curriculum.

      Criterion A (All-subject Exams) is not met because standardized
      exams were not used (Criterion E failed) and assessments were
      limited to the single subject of financial literacy.

      with caution due to the small and selective sample...” (p. 11)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation from
      their current educational stage. The study included a second
      post-test administered about four weeks after the intervention to
      measure "long-term impact". While the results suggest knowledge
      retention at this point, this four-week follow-up does not
      constitute tracking until graduation (end of secondary school for
      these 8th/9th graders). There is no mention of any further,
      longer-term data collection extending to graduation.

      Criterion G (Graduation Tracking) is not met because the study's
      follow-up period was only four weeks, not extending to graduation.

      data collection begins. The paper explicitly states it was
      registered in the AEA RCT Registry with ID AEARCTR-0004431.
      However, checking the registry (external information, but implied
      by the quote) reveals the registration date (September 23, 2019)
      was *after* the intervention period (Sep 2018 - Jan 2019) indicated
      in the paper's timeline and the registry itself. Since
      registration occurred after data collection started and ended,
      criterion P is not met.

      Criterion P (Pre-registered) is not met because the registration
      occurred after data collection was completed.
