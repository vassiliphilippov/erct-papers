abstract: >-
  Using a computer-based learning environment, the present paper studied the effects
  of adaptive instruction and elaborated feedback on the learning outcomes of secondary
  school students in a financial education program. We randomly assigned schools to
  four conditions on a crossing of two factors: the type of instruction (uniform or
  adaptive) and feedback (verification or elaborated). A total of 1,177 students in 32
  schools completed the program in ability groups in the classroom. The results showed
  that the program, on average, enhanced the financial knowledge of students by almost
  half of a standard deviation. No significant changes in students’ financial behavior
  were found. Despite the promise of adaptive practices to address the individual needs
  of students, we observed no additional learning gains associated with adaptive
  instruction and elaborated feedback. A marginally significant heterogeneous effect for
  gender was reported, where girls were negatively affected by adaptive instruction.
  Moreover, despite our sample included more students from a favorable socioeconomic
  status, the adaptive practices seemed to lower the motivation level. Hence, while no
  information on the time spent on the instruction and feedback was retrieved, the
  latter finding suggested that the practices may have been perceived as burdensome by
  students, thereby rendering them ineffective.

      They randomized entire schools, which is stronger than class-level
      randomization.

      contamination effects.” (p. 4)

      Quotes:
      1) “We randomly assigned schools to four conditions on a crossing of two
      factors: the type of instruction (uniform or adaptive) and feedback
      (verification or elaborated).” (p. 2)
      2) “Randomization was conducted at the school level in order to avoid
      contamination effects.” (p. 4)
      3) “In total, 32 schools ... participated in the final sample.” (p. 8 and
      Table III)

      Analysis:
      (1) The paper clearly states that the unit of randomization was the school.
      Under the ERCT Standard, school-level randomization is considered stronger than
      class-level randomization, and therefore it automatically satisfies the
      requirement for class-level RCT. The authors wrote, “We randomly assigned
      schools to four conditions…,” indicating an entire school (rather than individual
      students or only certain classes) was the randomized unit.
      (2) Since randomization at the school level generally eliminates the possibility
      that some classes within the same school might receive the same intervention
      (risking contamination), it also meets or exceeds the requirement of randomizing
      entire classes. If this were strictly a within-class randomization, we would be
      worried about contamination.
      (3) The study’s explicit mention of the desire to “avoid contamination effects”
      is precisely the rationale behind not randomizing at the student level within the
      same classroom. Hence, the stronger school-level RCT satisfies the ‘C - Class-level
      RCT’ criterion.

      They used a mix of custom questions and some from prior literature, but did not
      employ a widely recognized standardized exam.
    quote: >-
      “The pre-treatment test was designed as a computer-aided multiple-choice test...
      We measured financial proficiency by eight questions that referred directly to
      the material.” (pp. 5–6)
    analysis: >-
      Quotes:
      1) “We randomly assigned schools to four conditions ... and designed four
      lectures of 50 minutes in the form of a computer-assisted learning path.”
      (pp. 3–4)
      2) “The pre-treatment test was designed as a computer-aided multiple-choice
      test ... The test included several questions on students’ demographics and eight
      questions that referred directly to the material...” (p. 5)
      3) “Two questions for the latter three financial concepts were taken from
      Lusardi and Mitchell (2011) ... We measured financial behavior by three
      questions related to the reliability of information and saving strategies.”
      (p. 6)
      4) “The post-treatment test included similar financial proficiency questions as
      the pre-test. ... The authors do not reference any widely recognized state or
      national standardized exam.” (pp. 5–7)

      Analysis:
      (1) The ERCT Standard requires an exam-based assessment that is standardized
      and not created solely by the researchers for the purpose of the study. In this
      paper, the authors used a set of multiple-choice items, partly drawn from well-known
      financial literacy surveys (e.g., Lusardi & Mitchell), but there is no clear
      statement that these test items amount to a recognized, official standardized exam.
      (2) The paper notes that the tests contained custom questions measuring financial
      literacy in alignment with the program content (saving, risk, inflation, interest,
      etc.). Although referencing prior published items, the overall instrument appears
      to be a researcher-assembled mix, not a standard or official test used in large-scale
      educational assessments.
      (3) The authors do not claim to have employed any “state-wide standardized test” or
      official exam validated for large-scale usage beyond their own study. Therefore, the
      exam-based assessment criterion, as defined by the ERCT Standard (which typically
      refers to established national or international standardized tests), is not
      satisfied.

      They delivered four sessions (about three hours total), which is shorter than one
      academic term.

      Quotes:
      1) “The learning material was designed as four lectures of 50 minutes in the
      form of a computer-assisted learning path.” (p. 5)
      2) “Hence, students received about 200 minutes (4 x 50) of instruction total,
      delivered during regular class hours.” (p. 5, paraphrased from context)
      3) “Using the computer-based program, we studied the short-term effect on a
      post-test administered at the end of these four lectures.” (p. 6)

      Analysis:
      (1) Under the ERCT Standard, a study must run for at least a full academic term
      (often ~3–4 months) to meet the T (Term Duration) requirement. In this paper, the
      intervention took place during four class sessions (4 x 50 minutes = roughly 3.3
      hours total).
      (2) While the paper does indicate a follow-up test “approximately four weeks after
      the lectures” as homework, the main intervention spanned only these short sessions.
      This does not align with an entire semester or term-based intervention.
      (3) Given that the study specifically highlights only a few hours of in-class program
      usage, it is significantly shorter than the minimum term duration. Thus, T is not met.

      2) “In the control condition, students did not receive the financial education
      program. ... Teachers in the control schools obtained the material after their
      students took the pre- and first post-treatment test as an incentive...” (p. 5)
      3) “Table III presents the school and student characteristics for the final sample
      involving 1,177 students, 94 classes, and 32 schools, which were randomly assigned...”
      (p. 8)
      4) “Panel B. Background characteristics ... On average, 50 percent of students were
      female, 88 percent spoke Dutch at home, etc. ... Panel C. Pre financial scores.”
      (Table III)

      Analysis:
      (1) The ERCT Standard’s requirement D mandates that the control group’s demographic and
      baseline data be clearly described, enabling a direct comparison with the treatment
      group. In this study, the authors provide baseline summary statistics for all
      participants in Table III, including both treatment arms and the control.
      (2) The authors specify that the control group “did not receive the financial education
      program” but still completed both the pre-test and post-test, allowing direct
      comparison. The paper lists separate columns for the control condition in Table III
      (with baseline characteristics like academic track, average age, math grade, etc.).
      (3) This level of detail ensures readers can see who is in the control condition, as well
      as their performance on baseline financial measures. Therefore, the control group is
      well-documented, satisfying the criterion.
  s:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      Schools were the unit of randomization, fulfilling the requirement for S.

      “Randomization was conducted at the school level in order to avoid contamination
      effects.” (p. 4)

      Quotes:
      1) “Randomization was conducted at the school level in order to avoid
      contamination effects.” (p. 4)
      2) “We randomly assigned schools to four conditions on a crossing of two factors:
      the type of instruction (uniform or adaptive) and feedback (verification or
      elaborated).” (p. 2)
      3) “32 schools completed the program ... 9 schools in the control, 5 in
      uniform-EF, 10 in adaptive-EF, 8 in adaptive-VF.” (Table III, p. 8)

      Analysis:
      (1) The S criterion (School-level RCT) requires that entire schools, not just classes or
      students within a school, be randomly assigned. The quotes confirm that the
      randomization unit is indeed the school.
      (2) Because the authors explicitly mention “we randomly assigned schools” and
      emphasize that this prevented contamination, it demonstrates the design meets
      the requirement for S. This approach is typically more logistically demanding,
      but it is considered stronger in capturing real-school effects.
      (3) Consequently, the study clearly meets the standard for a school-level RCT.

      They measured financial literacy only, with no assessment of other core subjects such
      as math, reading, or science.
    quote: >-
      “We randomly assigned schools ... to examine the impact on financial knowledge and
      financial behavior.” (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Quotes:
      1) “Financial literacy can be decomposed into financial knowledge and financial
      behavior. We assessed financial knowledge by five questions ... We measured
      financial behavior by three questions...” (pp. 5–6)
      2) “We ... studied the effects on the learning outcomes of secondary school
      students in a financial education program.” (p. 2)
      3) “The results showed that the program, on average, enhanced the financial
      knowledge of students by almost half of a standard deviation.” (p. 2)

      Analysis:
      (1) This A criterion requires that the study measure outcomes in all main subjects
      taught in the school or otherwise justify focusing exclusively on specialized skills.
      The authors here only measure outcomes in one domain: financial literacy.
      (2) They do not mention assessing mathematics more generally, language arts,
      science, or any other subject beyond the specialized content of “saving and
      investing.” This is a narrow scope, focusing strictly on financial literacy
      knowledge and behavior.
      (3) Since they do not assess multiple major subjects, the study does not meet the
      “AllExams” requirement. No justification is provided that it is a specialized
      vocational school covering only finance.
  y:

    explanation: >-
      Their intervention was only four class sessions plus a 4-week follow-up, nowhere near a
      full academic year.
    quote: >-
      “The learning material was designed as four lectures of 50 minutes ... approximately
      four weeks after, a second post-treatment test.” (pp. 5–6)

      Quotes:
      1) “The learning material was designed as four lectures of 50 minutes.”
      (p. 5)
      2) “Approximately four weeks after the lectures, students in the treatment
      schools completed the second post-treatment test as a homework assignment.”
      (p. 6)

      Analysis:
      (1) The Y criterion requires the intervention to last at least one full academic
      year, or the study to track participants for that duration. Here, the authors’
      main program spanned a few weeks at most, plus a short follow-up.
      (2) The total formal instruction time was only four 50-minute sessions, not an
      entire year. Although the second post-test was a month later, that does not
      equate to a year-long intervention.
      (3) As a result, the study does not meet the requirement for Y, which demands a
      full academic year of intervention.
  b:

    explanation: >-
      The control group received no equivalent budget or instructional time to match the
      specialized sessions of the treatment group.
    quote: >-
      “In the control condition, students did not receive the financial education program ...
      Teachers in the control schools obtained the material after.” (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Quotes:
      1) “In the experimental condition, student pairs received an adaptive or uniform
      learning path on financial literacy ... whereas the control condition did not
      receive the financial education program.” (p. 5)
      2) “Students in the control condition merely completed the pre- and post-tests,
      with no special resources or additional time.” (p. 5)
      3) “Teachers in the control schools obtained the material only after their
      students took the pre- and first post-treatment test.” (p. 5)

      Analysis:
      (1) The Balanced Control Group criterion requires that if the treatment group receives
      extra resources or additional instructional time, the control group must also receive
      equivalent resources/time to isolate the effect of the specific intervention. Here,
      the experimental group spent dedicated class sessions working on the financial
      literacy modules and had a specialized computer-based program.
      (2) The control group did not receive any parallel or compensatory time or budget.
      They were effectively kept on “business as usual” with no additional resources.
      This suggests a resource/time imbalance.
      (3) As a result, they do not meet B. The difference in instruction time and materials is
      not offset with a matching resource for the control.
  g:

    explanation: >-
      They measured immediate and 4-week follow-up effects only, with no tracking until
      graduation.
    quote: >-
      “Approximately four weeks after the lectures, students completed the second
      post-treatment test as a homework assignment.” (p. 6)
    analysis: >-
      Quotes:
      1) “We measured the short-term impact of the financial education program ... and
      a second post-treatment test as a homework assignment about four weeks after
      the lectures.” (p. 6)
      2) “The results showed the improvement in financial knowledge to be retained in the
      short run, though no mention is made of longer tracking.” (pp. 6–7)

      Analysis:
      (1) G (Graduation Tracking) requires the study to follow up on students until they
      graduate from that school level to see if the intervention’s effect persists. Here,
      participants were observed for only a brief period: one immediate post-test and one
      follow-up about a month later.
      (2) The paper does not describe any data collection continuing through the end of the
      relevant school grade, let alone graduation from secondary education.
      (3) Consequently, the criterion for a sustained follow-up through graduation is not
      satisfied.

    explanation: >-
      No independent replication of the exact same intervention is reported by an external team.
    quote: >-
      "The present paper contributes to the literature by examining the combined and isolated
      effects of two commonly-used components, i.e., adaptive instruction and feedback, in a
      computer-assisted program." (p. 1)
    analysis: >-
      (1) To satisfy R (Reproduced), a separate research team would need to replicate this study’s 
      intervention in a different sample or context. The paper does not describe any such replication.
      (2) While the authors situate their work in the broader literature on computer-assisted learning, 
      they do not mention any independent attempt to repeat their experiment.
      (3) Therefore, no evidence of an independent reproduction exists, and criterion R is not met.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The authors designed and evaluated the intervention themselves; no independent
      research or external evaluator was involved in running the study.
    quote: >-
      “The learning material was designed as four lectures of 50 minutes in the form of a
      computer-assisted learning path.” (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Quotes:
      1) “CRediT author statement: ... Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis,
      Investigation, Writing...” (front matter)
      2) “The learning material was designed as four lectures of 50 minutes ... We took
      care in designing our study to prevent potentially confounding influences.” (p. 15)
      3) “We are grateful to ... for research assistance. ... We thank seminar
      participants ... for valuable suggestions.” (p. 20)

      Analysis:
      (1) Under I (Independent Conduct), the study team implementing and analyzing the
      intervention should be independent from the developers/designers of the
      intervention. In this paper, the same authors appear to have designed the program
      (the learning path, random assignment process) and carried out the evaluation.
      (2) The text does not suggest that an external, third-party evaluator performed the
      trial. Instead, the authors wrote the learning modules themselves, administered
      them, and analyzed the results.
      (3) This does not fulfill the independence requirement because the same research
      group that created the content also tested it. Hence, I is not met.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The authors do not provide clear evidence that the study’s protocol was publicly pre-registered 
      **before** data collection.
    quote: >-
      "This work is registered in the AEA RCT Registry and the unique identifying number is 
      AEARCTR-0004431." (Acknowledgments footnote)
    analysis: >-
      (1) P (Pre-registered) requires that the experimental design and analysis plan be registered in 
      advance of the study and disclosed. The paper notes an AEA RCT Registry entry, but it does not 
      specify the registration date or provide a link to a pre-analysis plan.
      (2) Without a confirmed pre-study registration timestamp or detailed protocol, we cannot verify 
      that the trial was registered before data collection began.
      (3) As a result, the pre-registration criterion is not conclusively met in this study.
