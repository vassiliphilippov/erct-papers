  Home math interventions often incorporate informational priming-explicit
  prompts emphasizing parental math input. While effective in increasing
  math talk, its impact on child outcome is mixed. This study examined how
  informational priming shapes the content and dynamic of math interactions.
  In year 2023, 122 Chinese parent-child dyads (M ChildAge Years = 5.25,
  52% girls) participated in a business-as-usual play session, followed
  2 weeks later by another session after parents were briefed on math talk
  importance. Parents increased math talk quantity and diversity but
  provided less autonomy support and exerted more control (large effects).
  Meanwhile, children were more frequently disengaged (medium effect). The
  findings reveal trade-offs, highlighting the need to balance increased
  math input with motivational support to foster children's math
  development.

    explanation: >-
      The paper is a within-subject experiment with no random assignment,
      so it is not a class-level RCT.
    quote: >-
      "Using a within‐subject experimental design, the present study
      investigates whether increasing parents' awareness of the importance
      of math input enhances the quantity and diversity of parental math
      input, while also exploring potential trade‐offs between the amount
      of math talk and the nature of the support provided." (p. 2162)

      1) "Using a within‐subject experimental design, the present study
      investigates whether increasing parents' awareness of the importance
      of math input enhances the quantity and diversity of parental math
      input, while also exploring potential trade‐offs between the amount
      of math talk and the nature of the support provided." (p. 2162)

      2) "Each parent–child dyad participated in two play sessions that were
      2 weeks apart." (p. 2165)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion C requires an RCT with randomisation at the class level (or
      stronger, at the school level). The paper explicitly states it uses a
      within-subject experimental design, and describes that each dyad took
      part in both contexts. There is no random assignment of classes,
      schools, or even individuals to different conditions.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion C is not met because the study is within-subject and does
      not randomise classes or schools to conditions.

      Outcomes are based on observational coding, not on standardized,
      exam-based assessments.

      "All interactions were video recorded, transcribed, and coded to
      assess (a) the quantity and quality of parental math talk (b)
      parental regulatory talk, and (c) children's engagement throughout
      the play activities." (p. 2165)

      parental regulatory talk, and (c) children's engagement throughout
      the play activities." (p. 2165)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires standardized, widely recognized exam-based
      assessments of educational outcomes. The study does not administer a
      standardized achievement test. Instead, it measures parent-child
      interaction features (math talk, regulatory talk, and child
      engagement) via video coding.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion E is not met because no standardized exam-based assessment
      is used.

      The study compares two 10-minute sessions separated by 2 weeks, far
      shorter than a term-long follow-up.

      1) "Each parent–child dyad participated in two play sessions that were
      2 weeks apart." (p. 2165)

      2) "Parents were asked to play for 10 min their child just as they
      typically would." (p. 2165)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion T requires outcome measurement at least one academic term
      after the intervention begins. Here, the informational priming occurs
      immediately before the second play session, and the two sessions are
      only 2 weeks apart. The interaction itself lasts 10 minutes per
      session, and there is no term-length tracking or delayed assessment.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion T is not met because outcomes are measured within 2 weeks,
      not after a full academic term.

      1) "Of the 122 dyads whose interactions were analyzed, 98 (80%) of the
      parents were mothers and 61 (50%) of the children were girls."
      (p. 2165)

      2) "Children's age ranged from 40 to 84 months (M = 62.68,
      SD = 11.05)." (p. 2165)

      3) "The families came from diverse SES backgrounds, with 34.4%
      reporting less than high school education, 16.4% some high school
      education, 45.1% a two- or four-year college degree, and 4.1% a
      graduate degree." (p. 2165)

      4) "In the first session (uninformed context), parents were unaware of
      the study's focus on math;" (p. 2165)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires the control condition to be well documented.
      Although the design is within-subject, the paper clearly defines the
      baseline "uninformed context" as the comparison condition and reports
      substantial participant demographics (age, gender, and education).
      The paper also describes what happened in the uninformed session,
      which serves as the control condition in this design.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion D is met because the baseline control condition and the
      participant characteristics are clearly documented.

      2) "Using a within‐subject experimental design, parents engaged in two
      separate play sessions with their children." (p. 2164)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the school (site) level. The
      paper describes recruiting individual dyads and using a within-subject
      design. No schools (or centers) are randomized to intervention versus
      control conditions.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion S is not met because there is no school-level randomization.

      2) "We acknowledge the help of Haoyu Novak Chen, Yiling Zhang, Mary
      Chen for their assistance with the data collection and analysis
      process." (p. 2172)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires that the study be conducted independently from
      the designers/authors of the intervention. The paper indicates that
      coding was performed by independent observers who were blinded to the
      research questions, which reduces coding bias. However, it does not
      state that an external evaluation team (independent organization)
      designed and ran the study. The acknowledgments also refer to help
      with data collection and analysis, consistent with the authors' team
      conducting the work.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion I is not met because there is no evidence of an independent
      third-party organization conducting the study end-to-end.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires outcomes to be measured at least one full
      academic year after the intervention begins. The study's entire
      measurement window is two sessions separated by 2 weeks.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion Y is not met because the follow-up duration is 2 weeks, not
      an academic year.

      Time and materials are essentially balanced across contexts; the main
      difference is the informational prime and a different toy set to
      reduce familiarity effects.
    quote: >-
      "The main difference between the play sessions was whether parents
      received informational priming." (p. 2165)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Each parent–child dyad participated in two play sessions that were
      2 weeks apart." (p. 2165)

      2) "During both sessions, parents were provided with a set of toys
      that included 15 unique plastic fruits and vegetables as well as a
      plastic plate (see Figure S1A, for materials and instructions)."
      (p. 2165)

      3) "Parents were asked to play for 10 min their child just as they
      typically would." (p. 2165)

      4) "The main difference between the play sessions was whether parents
      received informational priming." (p. 2165)

      5) "Further, to mitigate toy familiarity effects, a different set of
      15 fruits and vegetables were used in the second session." (p. 2165)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B requires that differences in time, budget, and resources
      be balanced across control and intervention conditions unless extra
      resources are the treatment variable. Here, both contexts involve the
      same task length (10 minutes) and comparable materials (toy sets
      designed to be comparable, with the second set changed only to reduce
      familiarity). The intervention is informational priming (a brief
      message), which does not add meaningful instructional time or
      resources beyond the intended manipulation.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion B is met because the two contexts have comparable time and
      materials, isolating the effect of the informational prime.

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires an independent replication by another research
      team in a different context, published in a peer-reviewed venue.
      Within the paper, the authors only note that materials and code are
      available to attempt replication. In a web search of major academic
      indexes and aggregators (PubMed, PMC, Semantic Scholar), we did not
      find any published independent replication of this specific study as
      of the ERCT check date.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion R is not met because no independent replication study was
      found.

      the play activities." (p. 2165)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires standardized exam-based outcomes across all main
      subjects taught at that level. This paper does not use standardized
      exams at all (criterion E is not met) and focuses on interaction
      measures during play rather than academic outcomes across subjects.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion A is not met because there are no standardized exams and no
      all-subject outcome measurement.

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Each parent–child dyad participated in two play sessions that were

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking participants until graduation and, per
      the ERCT rules, cannot be met if criterion Y (Year Duration) is not
      met. This study's timeline is only 2 weeks. The paper contains no
      description of longitudinal follow-up through a later educational
      transition or graduation. A web search did not identify follow-up
      publications by these authors that track this cohort to graduation.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion G is not met because the study lasts 2 weeks and provides
      no graduation tracking (and Y is not met).

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires a pre-registered protocol with registration prior
      to data collection. The paper explicitly states that the analyses were
      not preregistered, and it provides no registry ID or link that could
      be verified.

      Final Summary:

      Criterion P is not met because the study was not preregistered.
