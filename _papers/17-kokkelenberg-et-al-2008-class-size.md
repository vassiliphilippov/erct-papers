  We model how class size affects the grade higher education
  students earn and we test the model using an ordinal logit
  with and without fixed effects on over 760,000 undergraduate
  observations from a northeastern public university. We find
  that class size negatively affects grades for a variety of
  specifications and subsets of the data, as well as for the
  whole data set from this school. The specifications tested
  hold constant for academic department, peer effects (relative
  ability in class), student ability, level of student, level of
  course, gender, minority status, and other factors. Average
  grade point declines as class size increases, precipitously up
  to class sizes of twenty, and more gradually but monotonically
  through larger class sizes. The evidence is that this is not
  exclusively a small class effect. We conclude that there are
  diseconomies of scale associated with a deterioration of
  student outcomes as class sizes grow larger. The cost of this
  deterioration is not quantifiable with our data, as much of
  the costs are non-market costs and unobservable. Future
  studies of economies of scale in higher education need to
  address the traditional assumption of constant product
  quality.

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper does not describe any randomisation process at
      the class or school level; it employs observational analysis
      using an ordinal logit model.

      Final sentence: Criterion C is not met because no RCT was
      conducted.
    quote: null
    explanation: The study is observational and did not randomize at the class level.
    met: false
  e:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The dependent variable is the grade a student receives
         in a course." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper relies on course grades rather than any
      standardized exam. No widely recognized assessment is used.

      Final sentence: Criterion E is not met because no standardized
      exam-based assessment was employed.
    quote: null
    explanation: The study measures course grades rather than using standardized exams.
    met: false
  t:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None

      Detailed Analysis:

      As there is no intervention, no start or end dates are
      defined for follow‑up; outcomes are not measured after a
      full academic term.

      Final sentence: Criterion T is not met due to absence of a
      term‑long follow‑up.
    quote: null
    explanation: There is no intervention with outcomes measured after one academic term.
    met: false
  d:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None

      Detailed Analysis:

      This observational study does not include a separate control
      group; all observations enter a single regression model.

      Final sentence: Criterion D is not met because no control
      group is documented.
    quote: null
    explanation: The paper does not document a distinct control group.
    met: false
  s:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study does not involve any randomisation at the school
      level; it is purely observational.

      Final sentence: Criterion S is not met because no school‑level
      RCT was performed.
    quote: null
    explanation: No school-level randomization was performed.
    met: false
  i:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None

      Detailed Analysis:

      There is no indication of an independent evaluator; the
      authors conducted all design and analysis themselves.

      Final sentence: Criterion I is not met due to lack of third‑party
      evaluation.
    quote: null
    explanation: The study was conducted by the authors without an independent evaluator.
    met: false
  y:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None

      Detailed Analysis:

      No year‑long tracking is defined, as the paper analyzes an
      existing dataset without an intervention timeline.

      Final sentence: Criterion Y is not met because no year‑long
      follow‑up occurs.
    quote: null
    explanation: There is no intervention tracked for a full academic year.
    met: false
  b:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None

      Detailed Analysis:

      No additional instructional time or resources were allocated to any
      intervention group, nor was a control group provided with matched inputs.

      Final sentence: Criterion B is not met because
      no balancing of resources or time between groups occurred.
    quote: null
    explanation: No attempt to balance class time or resources.
    met: false

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "It is already well established that, 
         on average, bigger classes lead to lower grades 
         (Kokkelenberg et al., 2008; Bandiera et al., 
         2010; De Giorgi et al., 2012)." (Karas 2019, p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Other studies have replicated the findings in other contexts.
      For example, Bandiera et al. (2010) found similar negative effects 
      of class size on grades in a UK university setting. Similarly, De 
      Giorgi et al. (2012) reported comparable findings. The convergence 
      of evidence from multiple studies shows that the 
      original result holds beyond the initial setting.

      Final sentence: Criterion R is met because independent replications of 
      the findings are documented.
    quote: null
    explanation: The study's findings have been independently replicated by others.
    met: true
  a:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None

      Detailed Analysis:

      The study focuses solely on individual course grades and does
      not assess performance across all core subjects via standard
      exams.

      Final sentence: Criterion A is not met as no all‑subject
      evaluations were performed.
    quote: null
    explanation: The study does not use all-subject standardized exams.
    met: false
  g:
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      None

      Detailed Analysis:

      There is no follow‑up tracking until graduation; the analysis
      uses existing grade records only.
      The authors did not track students to graduation
      in any later study.

      Final sentence: Criterion G is not met due to lack of graduation
      tracking.
    quote: null
    explanation: No graduation tracking is performed.
    met: false

      Detailed Analysis:

      The paper contains no mention of protocol pre-registration or
      registry identifiers.

      Final sentence: Criterion P is not met because no
      pre-registration is referenced.
    quote: null
    explanation: No pre-registered protocol is referenced.
