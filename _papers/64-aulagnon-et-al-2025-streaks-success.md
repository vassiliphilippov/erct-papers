abstract: >-
  We examine whether highlighting streaks—instances of repeated and
  consecutive behavior when completing learning tasks—encourages 4th to 6th
  grade students in Peru to increase their use of an online math platform
  and improve learning. 60,000 students were randomly assigned to receive
  messages that (i) highlighted streaks, (ii) provided personalized
  reminders with positive reinforcement, (iii) provided generic reminders,
  or (iv) to a control group. Highlighting streaks and providing
  personalized reminders significantly increased platform use compared to
  generic reminders and the control group, with streaks more effective on
  the intensive margin and personalized reminders more effective on the
  extensive margin. Highlighting streaks also significantly improved math
  achievement compared to the control group among the 1,500 students who
  took an endline test, although differences with other treatment arms were
  not significant.

    explanation: >-
      The study randomized at the student level rather than the class or
      school level.
    quote: >-
      "60,000 students were randomly assigned to receive messages that (i)
      highlighted streaks, (ii) provided personalized reminders... or (iv)
      to a control group." (p. 1)

      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "60,000 students were randomly assigned to receive messages that
      (i) highlighted streaks, (ii) provided personalized reminders... or
      (iv) to a control group." (p. 1)

      2) "Randomization to treatment was carried out after the baseline
      test... 24,000 students were assigned to the control group..."
      (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard requires randomization to occur at the class or
      school level to prevent contamination, unless the intervention is
      strictly one-to-one tutoring. Here, the intervention involves sending
      app notifications (messages) to individual students/households. The
      quotes explicitly state that "students were randomly assigned,"
      indicating a student-level randomization. While the intervention is
      digital and personal (app notifications), it is not described as
      personal tutoring, and the standard prefers class-level assignment to
      minimize peer effects or contamination. As randomization was at the
      student level, this criterion is not met.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion C is not met because the study
      randomized individual students rather than classes or schools.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study used a custom endline test administered through the app
      rather than a widely recognized standardized exam.
    quote: >-
      "The baseline test and endline test were administered through the app
      ... They were closely aligned with the exercises included in the
      six-week treatment period..." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "The baseline test and endline test were administered through the
      app and had a very similar format. They were closely aligned with the
      exercises included in the six-week treatment period..." (p. 3)

      2) "We use data on the endline test to generate a standardized
      measure of math academic achievement by subtracting the fraction of
      correct responses from the mean of the control group..." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion E requires the use of widely recognized standardized
      assessments (e.g., state or national exams) rather than tests
      designed specifically for the study. The paper states the tests were
      "administered through the app" and were "closely aligned with the
      exercises included in the six-week treatment period." While the
      authors standardized the scores statistically (z-scores), the
      assessment tool itself was custom-made for this intervention context
      and is not a standard, external exam.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion E is not met because the study
      utilized a custom assessment aligned with the intervention rather
      than a standard external exam.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention duration was six weeks, which is shorter than the
      required full academic term.
    quote: >-
      "Our intervention took place during six weeks of the summer break..."
      (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Our intervention took place during six weeks of the summer break
      starting from the week of January 17, 2022, and until the week of
      February 21, 2022." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      The ERCT standard defines a term as approximately 3-4 months. This
      intervention explicitly "took place during six weeks." While it occurred
      during the summer break, the duration falls significantly short of the
      minimum requirement for a full academic term (usually 12+ weeks).
      Therefore, the study is considered short-term.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion T is not met because the
      intervention lasted only six weeks, which is shorter than a full
      academic term.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The control group is clearly defined as receiving no messages, and
      their demographics and baseline performance are well-documented.
    quote: >-
      "During the six-week treatment period, the control group did not
      receive any further notifications..." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "During the six-week treatment period, the control group did not
      receive any further notifications..." (p. 3)

      2) "Table 1 Baseline Balance... Control (1)... Multigrade 5.91...
      Female 51.12... Math achievement in 2021 -0.00..." (p. 5)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion D requires detailed documentation of the control group,
      including demographics and conditions. The paper provides a dedicated
      column in Table 1 listing the baseline characteristics (demographics,
      prior math achievement, school type) for the control group. Furthermore,
      the condition of the control group is explicitly described: they had
      access to the app but "did not receive any further notifications"
      specific to the treatment (streaks/reminders).

      Final sentence explaining if criterion D is met because the paper
      provides detailed baseline statistics and a clear description of the
      conditions for the control group.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study utilized student-level randomization, not school-level
      randomization.
    quote: >-
      "60,000 students were randomly assigned..." (p. 1)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "60,000 students were randomly assigned to receive messages..."
      (p. 1)

      2) "Randomization to treatment was carried out after the baseline
      test... stratified based on whether the student had completed the
      baseline test..." (p. 4)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion S requires randomization at the school level to simulate
      real-world implementation and account for school-wide factors. The
      quotes confirm that randomization was performed at the student level
      ("students were randomly assigned"), which does not meet the stronger
      school-level requirement.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion S is not met because the unit
      of randomization was the student, not the school.
  i:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study appears to be conducted by the authors who designed the
      intervention without a stated independent third-party evaluator.
    quote: >-
      "We compare the effect of sending messages which (i) highlighted
      streaks..." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We compare the effect of sending messages which (i) highlighted
      streaks..." (p. 2)

      2) "The learning platform used in this study, called 'Conecta Ideas,'
      included a student app that was developed at the Center for Advanced
      Research on Education at the Universidad de Chile..." (p. 3)

      3) "Author statement... We confirm that the manuscript has been read
      and approved by all named authors..." (p. 9)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion I requires the study to be conducted independently from the
      authors who designed the intervention. The paper gives no indication
      that an external evaluation firm or independent third party collected
      or analyzed the data. The authors themselves seem to be responsible
      for the design of the message intervention and the analysis of the
      results. While the app was developed by a center (where some authors
      are affiliated), the specific intervention (messaging) and the
      evaluation were conducted by the research team.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion I is not met because there is
      no evidence of independent conduct or external oversight separate
      from the intervention designers.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The intervention lasted six weeks, failing the one-year duration
      requirement.
    quote: >-
      "Our intervention took place during six weeks of the summer break..."
      (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "Our intervention took place during six weeks of the summer break
      starting from the week of January 17, 2022, and until the week of
      February 21, 2022." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion Y requires the study to span at least one full academic year.
      As noted in criterion T, this study was a six-week summer intervention.
      This does not meet the requirement for a year-long duration.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion Y is not met because the study
      duration was significantly shorter than one academic year.
  b:
    met: true
    explanation: >-
      The intervention specifically tested the impact of "nudges" (messages)
      as the treatment variable, so the lack of messages for the control
      group is by design and balanced.
    quote: >-
      "We compare the effect of sending messages which (i) highlighted
      streaks... and (iv) to a control group which did not receive any
      messages." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We compare the effect of sending messages which (i) highlighted
      streaks... and (iv) to a control group which did not receive any
      messages." (p. 2)

      2) "To encourage the use of the online math platform, notifications
      were sent through the app to the smartphones..." (p. 3)

      3) "During the six-week treatment period, the control group did not
      receive any further notifications, while the three treatment groups
      received different types of app notifications..." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion B checks for balanced resources (time/budget) between groups
      unless the extra resource is the variable being tested. In this study,
      the "resource" provided to the treatment group is the set of
      notifications (messages) designed to nudge behavior (highlighting
      streaks). The underlying educational resource (the math platform and
      exercises) was available to the control group (who had the app), but
      they did not receive the specific notifications. Since the study
      explicitly intends to test the impact of these messages (the "nudge")
      as the treatment variable, the absence of messages in the control group
      is the correct counterfactual and does not constitute an invalid
      imbalance.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion B is met because the additional
      resource (messages) was the explicit treatment variable being tested.
  r:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The paper states this is the first experimental study of its kind in
      this context, and no independent replication is cited.
    quote: >-
      "To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study examining the
      effects of highlighting streaks in an educational context." (p. 2)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study examining
      the effects of highlighting streaks in an educational context." (p. 2)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion R requires the study to be independently replicated. The
      authors explicitly state that this is the first study of its kind in
      an educational context. There are no references to subsequent independent
      replication studies in the text provided.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion R is not met because the study
      identifies itself as the first of its kind without citation of independent
      replication.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study only assessed math achievement and did not measure outcomes
      in other main subjects like reading or science.
    quote: >-
      "We also analyze effects on academic achievement... generate a
      standardized measure of math academic achievement..." (p. 3)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We also analyze effects on academic achievement... generate a
      standardized measure of math academic achievement..." (p. 3)

      2) "The exercises included... 30 exercises covering all the topics
      presented during the treatment period (i.e., 15 exercises for numeracy,
      and 5 for geometry, probability, and patterns, respectively)." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion A requires assessment of all main subjects (e.g., math,
      science, language arts) to check for negative spillovers. This study
      focused exclusively on mathematics ("math academic achievement"). No
      other subjects were assessed. Furthermore, Criterion E (standardized
      exam) was not met, which is a prerequisite for this criterion.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion A is not met because only math
      outcomes were measured and the prerequisite Criterion E was not met.
  g:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      The study followed up immediately after the six-week intervention; no
      graduation tracking was conducted.
    quote: >-
      "We cannot assess persistence following the end of treatment due to
      data limitations..." (p. 6)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We cannot assess persistence following the end of treatment due to
      data limitations..." (p. 6)

      2) "We also conducted a baseline test and an endline test, which took
      place in the weeks immediately before and after the six-week treatment
      period." (p. 3)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion G requires tracking students until graduation to assess
      long-term impacts. The paper explicitly states that data limitations
      prevented assessment of persistence following the end of the treatment.
      Tracking ended with the endline test immediately following the six-week
      summer program.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion G is not met because data
      collection stopped immediately after the intervention without long-term
      tracking.
  p:
    met: false
    explanation: >-
      There is no evidence of a pre-registered protocol with hypotheses and
      analysis plans in a public registry before data collection.
    quote: >-
      "We received approval for this project from the Via Libre... and
      registered the Conecta Ideas data with the Ministry of Justice in Peru."
      (p. 1)
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "We received approval for this project from the Via Libre (Comite
      Institutional de Bioetica) ethics board and registered the Conecta
      Ideas data with the Ministry of Justice in Peru." (p. 1)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Criterion P requires pre-registration of the full study protocol
      (hypotheses, methods, analysis plan) before data collection begins.
      The authors mention registering the *data* with the Ministry of Justice
      (likely for privacy/data protection compliance) and receiving ethics
      approval. However, there is no mention of registering the study protocol
      on a standard registry like ClinicalTrials.gov, OSF, or the AEA RCT
      Registry.

      Final sentence explaining if criterion P is not met because there is
      no citation of a pre-registered study protocol in a public registry.
