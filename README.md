# erct-papers
ERCT (Educational RCT) Standards Paper Repository

Todo:
- Add parameter: link to PDF
- Fix circle - to make it dynamic
- Fix footer
- Check each YAML with Deep Research
- Add date when ERCT analysys is done to each document and use this date in html
- Add favicon
- In some files (e.g., in standard.html), image URLs are referenced as "img/logo.svg" rather than using the Liquid filter ({{ '/assets/img/logo.svg' | relative_url }}) used elsewhere. Standardize URL generation for consistency and portability.
- More metadata for papers: Consider adding more metadata like DOI, publication journal, or research field for better categorization.
- make research field visualizable in code as tags
- Implement submitting feedback
- Update criteria.yml to include level for each criteria and remove custom code for checking letters for each level
