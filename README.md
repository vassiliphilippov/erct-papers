ERCT (Educational RCT) Standards Paper Repository

Todo:
- DONE Add parameter: link to PDF
- DONE Fix circle - to make it dynamic
- Fix footer
- Check each YAML with Deep Research
- DONE Add date when ERCT analysys is done to each document and use this date in html
- Add favicon
- In some files (e.g., in standard.html), image URLs are referenced as "img/logo.svg" rather than using the Liquid filter ({{ '/assets/img/logo.svg' | relative_url }}) used elsewhere. Standardize URL generation for consistency and portability.
- DONE More metadata for papers: Consider adding more metadata like DOI, publication journal, or research field for better categorization.
- DONE make research field visualizable in code as tags
- Implement submitting feedback
- Update criteria.yml to include level for each criteria and remove custom code for checking letters for each level 
- DONE Sort by level
- Rename "university level" to "higher education" 
- Add more paddings
- Increase fonts
- Increase margin in hover popup between explanation and quote, make quote italic?
- Ask ChatGPT in the corresponding deep research thread to output correct YAML
- Increase top margin for <br> in paper analisys <li>
- Redo Paper 8 check using Deep Research (it was simple search)
- Paper 8, criterion P - check AEA RCT Registry  AEARCTR-0004431 if it was pre-registered
- Paper 9, criterion B - wrong decision, right answer is it is N/A because the whole purpose of intervention was additional?
- Paper 11, ask Deep Research to correct wrong quotes and update corresponding Yaml sections
- Paper 12, criterion B seems to be wrong, "intervention group had exclusive access to the ITSS system", but the whole purpose is to check it. Update criterion description to prevent it.
- Paper 13, ask Deep Research to update G and R sections according to newly found data (include the arguments it provided)
- Paper 15, ask Deep Research to provide quotes for R from other papers confirming confirmation
- Paper 16, ask Deep Research to fix small incorrections in quotes
- Paper 17, check if grading is applicable for E, and maybe review grading criteria for university studies
- Paper 17, ask Deep Research if quote in R is from another paper and if so, mention it in the end of the quote
- Paper 18, carefully check logic of E - it seems standard tests were provided, ask Deep Research why it thinks so
- SSL certificate for https
