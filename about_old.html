I was finding for education interventions that I can trust.

RCT is a good base but unfortunately it isn't enough, I constantly met RCT papers that because how their studies were organized I couldn't trust.
Maybe the results there are right, maybe wrong, I just cannot get it from the papers.

There are not that many RCT studies in education, almost 100 times less than in medicine. 
And unfortunately even less are organized in the way that their results were useful for my purposes.

I wanted to find those few gem studies that are useful.

I have written 8 criteria for myself that I want to see in a paper to fully trust its result.
Some of those criteria have gradation of strength.

Checking many papers for satisfying those criteria could be laborous and prone to mistakes.
I found LLM prery accurate in analysis of long papers if prompted well.
ERCT Standard is designed to be a good prompt for LLMs to have detailed clearly described instructions.

<no statistical significance>

I have decided to make the findings open in case someone else finds it helpful.
