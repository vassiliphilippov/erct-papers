I have developed ERCT Standard, see attached.

Please check the attached paper (I have provided both PDF and text versions). 

I have checked this paper against the standard and the results are in the attached YAML (.md) file. 

I want you to check if this .md file. Please check each of 12 criteria results carefully:
* is the provided quotations correct?
* is the analisys correct?
* if the verdict correct?

Please pay particular attention to the following criteria:
* G - Graduation Tracking
* R - Reproduced 

Because those results can be described not in this paper but in some other papers.  
For "Graduation Tracking" it could be subsequent papers by the same authors 
and for "Reproduced" it could be studies by other authors reproducing this study. 
I want you to carefully search for other relevant papers. 

Overall, I want you to check the provided markdown file that summarizes 
correspondance of this paper to the ERCT standard, 
but if it is wrong then explain why and provide better alternative of this section 
in markdown format following the same format as the provided markdown file.

Search for all peer-reviewed papers for G and R criteria using all the available sources you can find.

Your output should include:
1. Table with 12 rows for each of 12 criteria
2. Column #1: criteria letter
3. Column #2: criteria name
4. Column #3: level
5. Column #4: Is the provided quote correct? (yes, no)
6. Column #5: Is the provided verdict correct? (yes, no)
7. Column  #6: (for criteria R and G) Does your search for other papers change the verdict in the markdown?

Then for each of the 12 criteria sections in markdown that was incorrect output a block with the following:
* explaining what was wrong in markdown
* a short summary of your changed
* output updated section in markdown format wrapped in 
```yaml
```

section following format of the provided markdown file.

Important: Don't ask me ANY additional questions, 
just do your research using the provided information and your best judgement.
