						<p>Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered the "gold standard" in educational research, but
							their implementation
							alone doesn't guarantee reliable or practical results. Many RCTs face challenges like unclear
							criteria, short-term
							focus, or limited applicability to real-world settings.
						</p>
						<p>The <strong>Educational Randomised Controlled Trial (ERCT) Standard</strong> solves these issues by
							introducing 12
							clear criteria,
							grouped into three levels, to ensure research is rigorous, transparent, and impactful in real-life
							educational contexts.
						</p>
						<p>ERCT was specially designed to be LLM friendly to provide well defined and easy to evaluate criteria that can 
							be checked automatically using model Large Language Models like ChatGPT.

						<p>ERCT is designed <strong>only</strong> for original RCT studies in education measuring influence of some education intervention on education outcomes.</p>

															If uncertain, look for additional quotes clarifying the nature of the intervention. 
															Include the detailed description of the additional resources into your explanation. 
															If the extra resources are the treatment variable, then the control group
															should be documented as receiving the standard input.
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<h6 class="approach__subtitle">If No Additional Resources Required</h6>
														<p class="approach__text">If the quotes show no extra resources

														</p>
														<p class="approach__text">Check Intervention Definition. Examine how the authors define the intervention itself. Look for explicit statements that frame additional resources (e.g., technology, training) as core components of what's being tested, not as supplementary elements. 
														</p>
														<p class="approach__text">Resource Integration Assessment. Determine if additional resources are: INTEGRAL: Explicitly described as the primary treatment variable being tested (e.g., "We tested whether providing tablets and training would improve outcomes"). or NON-INTEGRAL: Supplementary to the core intervention and could have been balanced (e.g., "We tested a new curriculum, and also provided extra training") 
														</p>
														<p class="approach__text">Resource Balance Verification. If resources are NON-INTEGRAL: Verify that the control group received comparable time, budget, and support quality to isolate the intervention's specific effect. If resources are INTEGRAL: Verify that the study clearly frames these additional resources as the central treatment variable being tested. 
														</p>
														<p class="approach__text">Within-Subjects Consideration. For within-subjects designs, verify that the no-treatment baseline period provides equivalent educational engagement (e.g., standard curriculum time or placebo activities) unless the additional resources are the explicit treatment variable.

														<h6 class="approach__subtitle">Decision</h6>
														<p class="approach__text">Mark as "met" if the evaluation confirms a balanced
