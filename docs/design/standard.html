						<p>Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered the "gold standard" in educational research, but
							their implementation
							alone doesn't guarantee reliable or practical results. Many RCTs face challenges like unclear
							criteria, short-term
							focus, or limited applicability to real-world settings.</p>
						<p>The <strong>Educational Randomised Controlled Trial (ERCT) Standard</strong> solves these issues by
							introducing 12
							clear criteria,
							grouped into three levels, to ensure research is rigorous, transparent, and impactful in real-life
							educational contexts.</p>
