Here is my project specification. 

# Overview

This project hosts a list of educational/scientific papers evaluated according to the “ERCT” standard 
(with the 12 CETD-SAYB-GRIP criteria). 
It is implemented as GitHub Pages.
The whole project is stored in GitHub repo.

The ERCT Standard is described in the following document:
docs/ERCT Standard.md

The original initial data about the papers is located as a set of 20 JSON files in the following folder:
_papers/json

JSON schema for those files is located in the following file:
docs/paper_json_schema.json

The website design prepared by a front developer freelancer is located at:
docs/design

The website should contain the following pages:
* home page 
* a page about the ERCT standard
* one page about each paper
