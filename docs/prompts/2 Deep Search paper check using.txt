# 1. Background

I have developed the ERCT Standard; see attached. The ERCT Standard is designed to evaluate educational RCT research papers
against additional criteria.

I have already reviewed one paper (see attached) and created a YAML file with the report. I need this YAML file to follows
very specific format which is described in the output specification.

However, the paper was graded just by reading the paper without internet access. So those criteria that require checking
other papers (like G, R, P) were not checked properly.

I want you to first check the provided report if it is correct and then search for relevant papers using the internet
and check the criteria G, R, P again.

The YAML file missing three fields: paper_link, pdf_link, date_erct_check.
Please update these metadata fields in the final YAML. 
Ensure that paper_link is set to the official DOI landing page and pdf_link is set to a direct PDF link, if available.

In the end you need to produce the final YAML file with the correct report.

# 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

## 2.1 Extract General Information

Update the following general fields using information from internet: paper_link, pdf_link, date_erct_check.

### 2.1.1 Paper Link  

* paper_link - file the link to the original paper

Find the the official URL (e.g., from the publisher’s website or DOI landing page).
Using the paper’s DOI and journal information, search for and include the official 
online link to the article (paper_link). 

### 2.1.2 PDF Link

* pdf_link - a link to the PDF version of the paper if it is available, otherwise leave blank

Find a direct link to download the PDF version of the paper for those papers that are available in PDF format.
If the paper is not available in PDF format, leave this field blank.

### 2.1.3 Date of ERCT Check

* date_erct_check - today's date

## 2.2 Check Quotes In Report

For each of 12 criteria check if the quotes in the YAML report are correct and verbatim and if not, update them. 
The quotes should be exactly as they appear in the paper.
 
# 2.3 Check Criteria G

The results about tracking until graduation can be described not in this 
paper but in subsequent papers by the same authors.
I want you to look for such papers in all available sources. If you find such papers, 
provide paper id (title, authors, year) and provide relevant quotes and analysis 
of them. Please pay special attention to provide exact verbatim quotes from the 
papers. Please write if you cannot find them , but don't try to make up quotes.

Then update the G section in the YAML report with the correct information.

# 2.4 Check Criteria R

This criteriod "Reproduced" is about other studies by other authors reproducing 
this study. I want you to carefully search for other relevant papers if all
available sources are checked. If you find such papers, provide paper id (title,
authors, year) and relevant quotes and analysis of them. Please pay special attention to 
provide exact verbatim quotes from the papers. Please write if you cannot find
them , but don't try to make up quotes.

Then update the R section in the YAML report with the correct information.

# 2.5 Check Criteria P

If the paper contains information about pre-registration of the protocol, search
the corresponding database to check if the protocol was pre-registered (the date
of registration should be before the study was started). If needed,
update the P section in the YAML report with the correct information.

## 2.6 Check Each of Other Criteria sections

Check each of the other criteria sections and update the YAML report with the correct information.
In that case you should output this section exactly as it is in the provided YAML file.
Pay particular attention to the criterion B as its definition in the ERCT specification has changed
since the last paper check.

## 2.7 Assign ERCT Level

Based on the ERCT standard levels and your findings about the 12 criteria assign correct erct_level to the paper.
By default set erct_level to 0.
If all level 1 criteria are met (C, E, T, D), set erct_level to 1.
If in additional to all level 1 criteria also all level 2 criteria are met (S, I, Y, B), set erct_level to 2.
If in additional to all level 1 and 2 criteria also all level 3 criteria are met (R, A, G, P), set erct_level to 3.


## 2.8 Output the final YAML

Output the final YAML following my output specification in downloadable formal or format that is easy to copy and paste.

## 2.9 Change Summary

Output a summary of the changes you made to the YAML report.

# 3. Output Specification

Make sure that your YAML file starts and ends with ---.

Ensure that no internal citation markers (e.g., :contentReference[...] 
or any similar tags) are present in the final YAML output. 

## 3.1 Output Format
Your output should be a markdown file for GitHub pages with valid YAML inside.

## 3.2 Maximum Line Length
Ensure each line does not exceed 80 symbols, use line breaks to make the text more readable.

## 3.3 YAML Schema

## 3.4 Criteria Field Description

### 3.4.1 Analysis Field
The "analysis" field should have the following structure:
a. first it should start from listing all relevant quotes from the 
paper in ABSOLUTELY VERBATIM form. Include ALL relevant quotes exactly 
as they appear in the paper (with page numbers if available) and 
include all of them in the analysis field.
b. then it should have a detailed analysis based on the criterion 
description from the standard and the relevant quotes and general paper 
content if this criterion is met or not and why
c. then it should provide the final one sentence summary

Here is a typical structure of the analysis field:
```
analysis: >-
  Relevant Quotes:

  1) "Quote 1..." (p. X)

  2) "Quote 2..." (p. Y)

  Detailed Analysis:
  
  Detailed analysis follows here, explaining how the quotes relate to the criterion...

  Final sentence explaining if criterion X is met/not met because...
```

If some analysis fields are structured differently please rewrite them.

Note empty lines between quotes and all paragraphs in this field.

Note that lines should not be more than 80 symbols and next line should be right after the beginning of the previous like in the example below.
Formatting example:
```
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:

      1) "All of the participating colleges volunteered to participate in the 
      study and had established their own approaches to corequisite remediation
      prior to participation." (page 84)
```

### 3.4.2 Explanation Field
The "explanation" field should be a one sentence summary of the analysis.

### 3.4.3 Quote Field
The "quote" field should be the most relevant quote from the paper that supports the analysis.
If no relevant quote is available for a criterion, set the “quote” field to null.

### 3.4.4 Met Field
The "met" field should be true if the criterion is met and false if it is not.

### 3.4.5 Criteria Specific Instructions

#### Criterion B:
In your analysis, compare the nature, quantity, and quality of resources 
(e.g., time, budget, materials) provided to both intervention and control 
conditions, including within-subjects baseline periods. Describe whether 
the control condition offers a comparable substitute for the intervention’s 
inputs (e.g., equivalent educational time or alternative activities). 
If not, explain how this imbalance affects the study’s ability to isolate 
the intervention’s effect, unless the study explicitly tests additional 
resources as the treatment variable (quote evidence of this intent).

Please note, than when an intervention explicitly tests the impact of 
additional resources (e.g., extra tutoring time or materials) as the primary
treatment variable, the control group may receive the standard 
'business as usual' level without additional resources, provided this is clearly 
stated as the study’s intent. Otherwise, any increase in time or budget in 
the intervention group must be matched in the control group with 
comparable educational inputs.

After you identify additional resources in the intervention group 
(like additional teacher professional development, additional time, etc),
you need to check if this additional resource was an integral part of the tested
intervention or it was an additional optional resource not an integral 
part of the intervention how it was defined in the paper. 

If this additional resource is an integral part of the intervention then 
if doesn't automatically violate this criterion B. However make sure that 
this additional resource is clearly mentioned in your analysis and the summary.

BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS CRITERION. MANY PEOPLE FAIL MARKING THIS CRITERION.
Use the following pseudo code decision tree to make your decision regarding 
criterion B:

```pseudocode
function evaluateCriterionB(paper) {
  /* ---------------- 0. Paper‑specific helper stubs ------------------ */
  const EXTRA_RESOURCES_PRESENT   = paper.interventionAddsTimeOrBudget();     
  const RESOURCES_ARE_TREATMENT   = paper.extraResourcesIntegralToDesign();   
  const CONTROL_MATCHES_RESOURCES = paper.controlMatchesTimeBudget();        
  const WITHIN_SUBJECTS           = paper.isWithinSubjectsDesign();           
  const BASELINE_IS_EQUIVALENT    = paper.baselineHasEquivalentEngagement();  
  const NEGLIGIBLE_DIFF           = paper.extraResourcesDifferenceIsNegligible(); 

  /* ------------ 1. No extra time/budget at all → met --------------- */
  if (!EXTRA_RESOURCES_PRESENT) {
    // Reason: Intervention adds no extra resources; balance requirement trivially satisfied.
    return met();
  }

  /* ---- 1a. Extra resources present but difference is NEGLIGIBLE ---- */
  if (NEGLIGIBLE_DIFF) {
    // Reason: Additional time/budget is so small it cannot plausibly
    // account for outcome differences; treat groups as balanced.
    return met();
  }

  /* === 2. Extra resources *are the thing being tested* → met ======= */
  if (RESOURCES_ARE_TREATMENT) {
    // Reason: Study explicitly tests the effect of providing additional resources.
    // Control may remain “business‑as‑usual” by design (spec §§ 5a–5c).
    return met();
  }

  /* ------------- 3. Extra resources but NOT integral --------------- */
  if (CONTROL_MATCHES_RESOURCES) {
    // Reason: Control group was given equivalent time/budget, isolating the intervention itself.
    return met();
  }

  /* ------------ 4. Within‑subjects special‑case branch -------------- */
  if (WITHIN_SUBJECTS) {
    if (BASELINE_IS_EQUIVALENT) {
      // Reason: Baseline periods provided equivalent engagement despite within‑subjects design.
      return met();
    } else {
      // Reason: Baseline periods lacked equivalent engagement in within‑subjects design.
      return notMet();
    }
  }

  /* -------------------- 5. Otherwise → not met --------------------- */
  // Reason: Extra resources given only to intervention with no matching control
  // and those resources are NOT framed as the treatment variable.
  return notMet();
}
```

#### Criterion A:
If criterion E (Exam-based Assessment) is not met, then this criterion is not met either.

#### Criterion Y:
If criterion T (Term Duration) is not met, then this criterion is not met.

#### Criterion G:
If criterion Y (Year Duration) is not met, then this criterion is not met.

The results about tracking until graduation can be described not in this 
paper but in subsequent papers by the same authors. 
I want you to look for such papers in available sources. If you find such papers, 
provide paper id (title, authors, year) and provide relevant quotes and analysis 
of them. Please pay special attention to provide exact verbatim quotes from the 
papers. Please write if you cannot find them, but don't try to make up quotes.

#### Criterion R:
This criteriod "Reproduced" is about other studies by other authors reproducing 
this study. I want you to carefully search for other relevant papers if all
available sources are checked. If you find such papers, provide paper id (title,
authors, year) and relevant quotes and analysis of them. Please pay special attention to 
provide exact verbatim quotes from the papers. Please write if you cannot find
them , but don't try to make up quotes.


## 3.5 Text Format

VERY IMPORTANT: Don't include references like ":contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}" 
in the output text!

# 4. Your Task

Now I want you to carefully check the ERCT Standard, the provided paper and act according to 
the provided step-by-step instructions to generate the final output following the specification format
as a valid markdown file containing YAML as your final.

Don't forget to update the paper_link, pdf_link, date_erct_check fields in the YAML file.

Please ensure that no internal citation markers (e.g., :contentReference[...] or any 
similar tags) are present in the final YAML output.

Please note that I recently changed the order of the criteria in the ERCT Standard, so the provided .md file could have older order, if so please update it to the new order.
Make sure that erct_level is calculated correctly based on the new order of the criteria.

Make sure that your YAML file starts and ends with ---.
