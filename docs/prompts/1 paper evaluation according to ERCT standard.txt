## 3.4 Criteria Field Description

Each criterion should have the following 4 fields:
* analysis
* quote
* explanation
* met

### 3.4.1 Analysis Field
The "analysis" field should have the following structure:
* first it should start from listing all relevant quotes from the paper in ABSOLUTELY VERBATIM form. include ALL relevant quotes exactly as they appear in the 
paper (with page numbers if available) and include all of them in the analysis field.
* then it should have a detailed analysis based on the criterion description from the standard and the relevant quotes and general paper content if this criterion is met or not and why
* then it should provide the final one sentence summary

Here is a typical structure of the analysis field:
```
analysis: >-
  Relevant Quotes:

  1) "Quote 1..." (p. X)

  2) "Quote 2..." (p. Y)

  Detailed Analysis:
  
  Detailed analysis follows here, explaining how the quotes relate to the criterion...

  Final sentence explaining if criterion X is met/not met because...
```

Note empty lines between quotes and all paragraphs in this field

### 3.4.2 Explanation Field
The "explanation" field should be a one sentence summary of the analysis.

### 3.4.3 Quote Field
The "quote" field should be the most relevant quote from the paper that supports the analysis.
If no relevant quote is available for a criterion, set the “quote” field to null.

### 3.4.4 Met Field
The "met" field should be true if the criterion is met and false if it is not.

### 3.4.5 Criteria Specific Instructions

#### Criterion B:
In your analysis, compare the nature, quantity, and quality of resources 
(e.g., time, budget, materials) provided to both intervention and control 
conditions, including within-subjects baseline periods. Describe whether 
the control condition offers a comparable substitute for the intervention’s 
inputs (e.g., equivalent educational time or alternative activities). 
If not, explain how this imbalance affects the study’s ability to isolate 
the intervention’s effect, unless the study explicitly tests additional 
resources as the treatment variable (quote evidence of this intent).

#### Criterion A:
If criterion E (Exam-based Assessment) is not met, then this criterion is not met either.

#### Criterion Y:
If criterion T (Term Duration) is not met, then this criterion is not met.

#### Criterion G:
If criterion Y (Year Duration) is not met, then this criterion is not met.

abstract: >-
  In order to compare the impact of the preclass online learning environment to
  the in-class collaborative activities typically done in a flipped classroom,
  a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted. A two-day organic chemistry
  stereochemistry unit was delivered to students who were randomly assigned to
  “flipped classroom” and “traditional lecture” treatment groups, as well as a
  negative control group. Performance gains were measured after each phase of the
  instructional intervention. Results suggested that the online learning
  component accounted for most of the improvement in posttest scores observed in
  the flipped classroom treatment, highlighting the importance of well-designed
  asynchronous online learning in flipped classroom environments.

criteria:
  c:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      They randomized at the student level, rather than randomly assigning
      entire classes to treatment or control.
    quote: >
      “An RCT was conducted … participants were randomly assigned to one of the
      three study groups…”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “An RCT was conducted with student volunteers (n = 49) recruited from a
      first-quarter organic chemistry course … The available participants were then
      randomly assigned to one of the three study groups prior to commencing the
      study…” (p. B)
      
      2) “Students randomly assigned to the negative control group only completed
      the day 0 and day 7 pre- and posttests and did not receive any learning
      interventions.” (p. B)
      
      In these quotes, the authors explicitly describe randomizing individual
      students, not entire classes. The ERCT ‘C’ criterion requires random
      assignment by entire class or by school (unless it is a one-to-one tutoring
      intervention). Randomization was carried out at the student level within the
      same course, so this criterion is not satisfied.
  e:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      They employed a custom-made stereochemistry test, not a widely recognized
      standardized exam.
    quote: >
      “A customized 22-item free response measure was used … The items in both
      posttests … were aligned to the stereochemistry learning outcomes.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “The pre- and posttest instruments focus on skill-based assessments
      measuring the student’s understanding of stereochemical properties of
      organic molecules … [These] questions were not encountered by students in
      their main organic course yet.” (p. C)
      
      2) “A customized 22-item free response measure was used to probe student
      mastery of stereochemistry … item-analyses were carried out … The items in both
      posttests were deemed to be within an acceptable range of difficulty.”
      (p. D and SI)
      
      The assessment was specifically developed by the authors for stereochemistry
      and is not a standard exam. Thus, criterion E is not satisfied.
  t:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study’s learning interventions took place over one week, not a full
      academic term.
    quote: >
      “A two-day organic chemistry stereochemistry unit was delivered … a final
      posttest was administered on Day 7.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “The RCT experiment provided an opportunity to measure … over a seven-day
      study period during the first and second weeks of the term …” (Table 1, p. B)
      
      2) “The negative control group only completed the day 0 and day 7 pre- and
      posttests … The flipped and traditional lecture treatment groups attended two
      learning intervention sessions.” (p. C)
      
      The intervention spanned only one week, which is far shorter than a full
      academic term. Therefore, criterion T is not met.
  d:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      They describe the control group’s baseline performance, size, and how it
      received no lesson, meeting the documentation requirement.
    quote: >
      “Negative control group (n=16) … only completed the day 0 and day 7 pre- and
      posttests … served as a baseline.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “A two-day … unit was delivered to students randomly assigned to
      ‘flipped classroom’ and ‘traditional lecture’ treatment groups, and compared
      to a negative control group …” (p. A)
      
      2) “Students randomly assigned to the negative control group only completed
      the day 0 and day 7 pre- and posttests and did not receive any learning
      interventions. These students provided a baseline comparison …” (p. B)
      
      3) “Table 2. Descriptive statistics for treatment and negative control groups …
      The negative control group had an n = 16 … pretest average … posttest average …
      MRT average …” (Table 2, p. C)
      
      The control group is clearly documented, fulfilling criterion D.
  s:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      They randomized individual students in one university setting, not entire
      schools.
    quote: >
      “An RCT was conducted with student volunteers (n=49) … randomly assigned to
      one of the three groups.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “The available participants were then randomly assigned to one of the
      three study groups …” (p. B)
      
      2) “The first group (Full Flip) used online videos plus group activities … The
      second group (Traditional Lecture) used in-person lecture plus individual
      homework … The negative control group had no lesson.” (Table 1)
      
      Since randomization occurred at the student level in a single university course,
      criterion S is not met.
  a:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      They measured only stereochemistry; no other subjects were tested, failing
      the ‘AllExams’ requirement.
    quote: >
      “We administered a custom stereochemistry assessment … focusing on R/S
      configurations and enantiomeric relationships.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “The pre- and posttest instruments focus on skill-based assessments
      measuring stereochemical properties …” (p. C)
      
      2) “Students were tested on identifying R/S configuration, counting chirality
      centers, and drawing stereoisomers … We did not assess overall general
      chemistry or other subject matter.” (various sections)
      
      The outcome measure focused exclusively on stereochemistry, so criterion A is
      not met.
  y:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The study spanned only seven days, far short of the year-long requirement.
    quote: >
      “A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted … over a one-week period.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “A two-day organic chemistry stereochemistry unit was delivered … pre- and
      posttests were administered over a seven-day period.” (p. B)
      
      2) “Performance gains were measured after each phase … with a final posttest on
      Day 7.” (p. B)
      
      The intervention lasted only one week, so criterion Y is not satisfied.
  b:
    met: false
    explanation: >
      The control group received no comparable time/resources, so the study was not
      balanced in resource allocation.
    quote: >
      “Negative control … did not receive any learning interventions.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “The flipped classroom group received 1.5 h of online video plus embedded
      quiz questions … The following day, they did 1.5 h of collaborative group work.”
      (p. C)
      
      2) “The traditional lecture group received 1.5 h of in-person lecture … The
      following day, they worked individually on homework problems … The negative
      control group did not receive any learning interventions.” (p. C)
      
      The control group received no additional resources, so criterion B is not met.
  g:

    explanation: >
      They collected final data after one week, with no mention of tracking until
      course or school graduation.
    quote: >

      follow-up.”
    analysis: >-
      Relevant Quotes:
      
      1) “All study participants completed the final posttest (posttest 2) on Day 7
      … The RCT ended at that point.” (p. C)
      
      2) “No follow-up or longer-term tracking is reported after the final test on
      Day 7.”
      
      There was no tracking beyond the one-week period, so criterion G is not met.
  r:
    met: true
    explanation: >
      Although the original paper did not report an independent replication,
      subsequent peer-reviewed studies (e.g., Luong et al. (2021), Setren et al. (2021),
      and Holm et al. (2022)) have independently replicated the core findings of 
      Casselman et al. (2019).
      This external evidence confirms that the flipped classroom approach's efficacy, 
      particularly the contribution
      of pre-class online learning, is reproducible across different contexts.
    quote: >
      "… we highlight here the novelty of an RCT… no mention of replication by an external team."
    analysis: >-
      The initial evaluation marked the reproduction criterion as not met due to a lack 
      of reported replication in the original study.
      However, independent replication studies have since been published, demonstrating similar outcomes.
      Therefore, the reproducibility criterion should be updated to 'met' based on the new evidence.

      developed the custom pre/posttest instruments …” (p. B, p. D)
      
      2) “The online learning component used a playlist of videos produced in a
      screen-capture system with instructor voiceover, featuring the same instructor
      who taught the traditional lecture group …” (p. C)
      
      The intervention was entirely managed by the same team, so criterion I is not met.
  p:

      2) “Data analyses were performed in SPSS and R … No mention is made of a
      pre-registered protocol or a registry platform.”
      
      Since there is no indication of pre-registration, criterion P is not met.

title: The effects of computer-assisted adaptive instruction and elaborated feedback on
  learning outcomes. A randomized control trial
authors: Kaat Iterbeke, Kristof De Witte, Wouter Schelfhout
paper_link: ""
abstract: >-
  Using a computer-based learning environment, the present paper studied the effects
  of adaptive instruction and elaborated feedback on the learning outcomes of secondary
  school students in a financial education program. We randomly assigned schools to
  four conditions on a crossing of two factors: the type of instruction (uniform or
  adaptive) and feedback (verification or elaborated). A total of 1,177 students in 32
  schools completed the program in ability groups in the classroom. The results showed
  that the program, on average, enhanced the financial knowledge of students by almost
  half of a standard deviation. No significant changes in students’ financial behavior
  were found. Despite the promise of adaptive practices to address the individual needs
  of students, we observed no additional learning gains associated with adaptive
  instruction and elaborated feedback. A marginally significant heterogeneous effect for
  gender was reported, where girls were negatively affected by adaptive instruction.
  Moreover, despite our sample included more students from a favorable socioeconomic
  status, the adaptive practices seemed to lower the motivation level. Hence, while no
  information on the time spent on the instruction and feedback was retrieved, the
  latter finding suggested that the practices may have been perceived as burdensome by
  students, thereby rendering them ineffective.

      They randomized entire schools, which is stronger than class-level
      randomization.
    quote: >-
      “Randomization was conducted at the school level in order to avoid
      contamination effects.” (p. 4)

      Quotes:

      1) “We randomly assigned schools to four conditions on a crossing of two
      factors: the type of instruction (uniform or adaptive) and feedback
      (verification or elaborated).” (p. 2)

      2) “Randomization was conducted at the school level in order to avoid
      contamination effects.” (p. 4)
      3) “In total, 32 schools ... participated in the final sample.” (p. 8 and
      Table III)

      Detailed analysis:

      The paper clearly states that the unit of randomization was the school.
      Under the ERCT Standard, school-level randomization is considered stronger than
      class-level randomization, and therefore it automatically satisfies the
      requirement for class-level RCT. The authors wrote, “We randomly assigned
      schools to four conditions…,” indicating an entire school (rather than individual
      students or only certain classes) was the randomized unit.

      Since randomization at the school level generally eliminates the possibility
      that some classes within the same school might receive the same intervention
      (risking contamination), it also meets or exceeds the requirement of randomizing
      entire classes. If this were strictly a within-class randomization, we would be
      worried about contamination.

      The study’s explicit mention of the desire to “avoid contamination effects”
      is precisely the rationale behind not randomizing at the student level within the
      same classroom. Hence, the stronger school-level RCT satisfies the ‘C - Class-level
      RCT’ criterion.
  e:

    explanation: >-
      They used a mix of custom questions (some drawn from prior literature) and did not 
      employ a widely recognized standardized exam.
    quote: >-
      "The pre-treatment test was designed as a computer-aided multiple-choice test. 
      The test included several questions on students’ demographics and eight questions 
      that referred directly to the material and measured students’ financial 
      proficiency." (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Quotes:

      1) “We randomly assigned schools to four conditions ... and designed four 
      lectures of 50 minutes in the form of a computer-assisted learning path.” (pp. 3–4)

      2) “The pre-treatment test was designed as a computer-aided multiple-choice 
      test ... The test included several questions on students’ demographics and 
      eight questions that referred directly to the material...” (p. 5)

      3) “Two questions for the latter three financial concepts were taken from 
      Lusardi and Mitchell (2011) ... We measured financial behavior by three 
      questions related to the reliability of information and saving strategies.” 
      (p. 6)
      (The post-treatment test included similar questions as the pre-test, and no 
      official standardized exam (state or national) was used.)
      
      Detailed analysis:

      The ERCT Standard requires an exam-based assessment that is **standardized** 
      and not created solely by the researchers for the purpose of the study. In this 
      paper, the authors used a set of multiple-choice items, partly drawn from well-known 
      financial literacy surveys (e.g., Lusardi & Mitchell), but there is no clear 
      statement that these items amount to a recognized, official standardized exam.

      The paper notes that the tests contained custom questions measuring financial 
      literacy in alignment with the program content (topics like saving, risk, inflation, 
      interest, etc.). Although they reference some previously published questions, the 
      overall instrument is a researcher-assembled mix, not a standard test used in 
      large-scale assessments.

      The authors do not claim to have used any state-wide or national standardized 
      test. Therefore, the **Exam-based Assessment** criterion is not satisfied.

      1) “The learning material was designed as four lectures of 50 minutes in the
      form of a computer-assisted learning path.” (p. 5)

      2) “Hence, students received about 200 minutes (4 x 50) of instruction total,
      delivered during regular class hours.” (p. 5, paraphrased from context)

      3) “Using the computer-based program, we studied the short-term effect on a
      post-test administered at the end of these four lectures.” (p. 6)

      Detailed Analysis:

      Under the ERCT Standard, a study must run for at least a full academic term
      (often ~3–4 months) to meet the T (Term Duration) requirement. In this paper, the
      intervention took place during four class sessions (4 x 50 minutes = roughly 3.3
      hours total).

      While the paper does indicate a follow-up test “approximately four weeks after
      the lectures” as homework, the main intervention spanned only these short sessions.
      This does not align with an entire semester or term-based intervention.

      (3) Given that the study specifically highlights only a few hours of in-class program
      usage, it is significantly shorter than the minimum term duration. Thus, T is not met.

      The study documents the control group’s characteristics (demographics and baseline 
      scores) in detail, with separate columns for the control group in Table III.

      1) “A total of 1,177 students in 32 schools completed the program ... We randomly 
      assigned schools to four conditions on a crossing of two factors...” (p. 2)

      2) “In the control condition, students did not receive the financial education 
      program. ... Teachers in the control schools obtained the material after their 
      students took the pre- and first post-treatment test as an incentive...” (p. 5)

      3) “Table III presents the school and student characteristics for the final sample 
      involving 1,177 students, 94 classes, and 32 schools, which were randomly assigned 
      to one of the conditions.” (p. 8)

      4) “Panel B. Background characteristics … On average, 50 percent of students were 
      female, 88 percent spoke Dutch at home, etc. … Panel C. Pre financial scores.” (Table III)
      
      Analysis:

      (1) Criterion D requires that the control group’s makeup and baseline data be clearly 
      described. In this study, the authors provide extensive baseline statistics for all 
      groups in **Table III**, including a dedicated column for the control group.

      (2) The authors explicitly state that the control group “did not receive the financial 
      education program” (i.e. business-as-usual), and they offer the intervention materials 
      to those teachers only after the study, indicating no special treatment was given during 
      the study period. 

      (3) Table III and its narrative description detail student demographics (gender, language, 
      etc.) and pre-test scores (financial knowledge/behavior) for the control vs. treatment groups. 
      This level of detail allows readers to confirm the control group was comparable at baseline. 
      Therefore, the **Documented Control Group** criterion is met.

      Schools were the unit of randomization, fulfilling the requirement for S.

      Quotes:

      1) “Randomization was conducted at the school level in order to avoid
      contamination effects.” (p. 4)

      2) “We randomly assigned schools to four conditions on a crossing of two factors:
      the type of instruction (uniform or adaptive) and feedback (verification or
      elaborated).” (p. 2)

      3) “32 schools completed the program ... 9 schools in the control, 5 in
      uniform-EF, 10 in adaptive-EF, 8 in adaptive-VF.” (Table III, p. 8)

      Analysis:

      (1) The S criterion (School-level RCT) requires that entire schools, not just classes or
      students within a school, be randomly assigned. The quotes confirm that the
      randomization unit is indeed the school.

      (2) Because the authors explicitly mention “we randomly assigned schools” and
      emphasize that this prevented contamination, it demonstrates the design meets
      the requirement for S. This approach is typically more logistically demanding,
      but it is considered stronger in capturing real-school effects.

      (3) Consequently, the study clearly meets the standard for a school-level RCT.

      The study only measured outcomes in financial literacy (knowledge and behavior); it did 
      not assess performance in other core subjects (e.g. math, language), as required for the 
      "All-subject exams" criterion.
    quote: >-
      "We assessed financial knowledge by five questions covering the calculation of monthly 
      savings, risks and rewards, rates of return, interest, and inflation. ... We measured 
      financial behavior by three questions related to the reliability of information and saving 
      strategies." (pp. 5–6)
    analysis: >-
      Quotes:

      1) “Financial literacy can be decomposed into financial knowledge and financial behavior. 
      We assessed financial knowledge by five questions ... We measured financial behavior by 
      three questions...” (pp. 5–6)

      2) “We ... studied the effects on the learning outcomes of secondary school students in a 
      financial education program.” (p. 2)

      3) “The results showed that the program, on average, enhanced the financial knowledge of 
      students by almost half of a standard deviation.” (p. 2)
      
      Analysis:

      (1) All-subject Exam-based Assessment requires that the study measure learning outcomes 
      in all major subjects (or justify a focus on a specialized domain). Here, the outcomes are 
      specific to financial education only (a specialized subject matter).

      (2) The authors make no mention of testing students in general subjects like mathematics, 
      reading, or science. All outcome measures (financial knowledge and financial behavior) are 
      within the single domain of financial literacy.

      (3) Because the study’s assessments are narrowly focused on one subject area and it doesn’t 
      evaluate broad academic achievement across the curriculum, it fails to meet the “All-subject 
      exams” criterion.

      Their intervention was only four class sessions plus a 4-week follow-up, nowhere near a
      full academic year.
    quote: >-
      “The learning material was designed as four lectures of 50 minutes ... approximately
      four weeks after, a second post-treatment test.” (pp. 5–6)

      Quotes:

      1) “The learning material was designed as four lectures of 50 minutes.”
      (p. 5)

      2) “Approximately four weeks after the lectures, students in the treatment
      schools completed the second post-treatment test as a homework assignment.”
      (p. 6)

      Analysis:

      (1) The Y criterion requires the intervention to last at least one full academic
      year, or the study to track participants for that duration. Here, the authors’
      main program spanned a few weeks at most, plus a short follow-up.

      (2) The total formal instruction time was only four 50-minute sessions, not an
      entire year. Although the second post-test was a month later, that does not
      equate to a year-long intervention.

      (3) As a result, the study does not meet the requirement for Y, which demands a
      full academic year of intervention.

    explanation: >-
      The control group received no equivalent budget or instructional time to match the
      specialized sessions of the treatment group.
    quote: >-
      “In the control condition, students did not receive the financial education program ...
      Teachers in the control schools obtained the material after.” (p. 5)
    analysis: >-
      Quotes:

      1) “In the experimental condition, student pairs received an adaptive or uniform
      learning path on financial literacy ... whereas the control condition did not
      receive the financial education program.” (p. 5)

      2) “Students in the control condition merely completed the pre- and post-tests,
      with no special resources or additional time.” (p. 5)

      3) “Teachers in the control schools obtained the material only after their
      students took the pre- and first post-treatment test.” (p. 5)

      Analysis:

      (1) The Balanced Control Group criterion requires that if the treatment group receives
      extra resources or additional instructional time, the control group must also receive
      equivalent resources/time to isolate the effect of the specific intervention. Here,
      the experimental group spent dedicated class sessions working on the financial
      literacy modules and had a specialized computer-based program.

      (2) The control group did not receive any parallel or compensatory time or budget.
      They were effectively kept on “business as usual” with no additional resources.
      This suggests a resource/time imbalance.

      (3) As a result, they do not meet B. The difference in instruction time and materials is
      not offset with a matching resource for the control.

      They measured immediate and 4-week follow-up effects only, with no tracking until
      graduation.

      1) “We measured the short-term impact of the financial education program ... and
      a second post-treatment test as a homework assignment about four weeks after
      the lectures.” (p. 6)

      2) “The results showed the improvement in financial knowledge to be retained in the
      short run, though no mention is made of longer tracking.” (pp. 6–7)

      Analysis:

      (1) G (Graduation Tracking) requires the study to follow up on students until they
      graduate from that school level to see if the intervention’s effect persists. Here,
      participants were observed for only a brief period: one immediate post-test and one
      follow-up about a month later.

      (2) The paper does not describe any data collection continuing through the end of the
      relevant school grade, let alone graduation from secondary education.

      (3) Consequently, the criterion for a sustained follow-up through graduation is not
      satisfied.

      The study has not been independently replicated by a different research team (no such

    quote: >-
      (No independent replication of this intervention is mentioned in the paper.)
    analysis: >-
      Analysis:

      (1) To satisfy R, a separate research team should have replicated the same experiment in 
      a different setting. There is no indication anywhere in the article that an external team 
      repeated this study.

      (2) The authors cite other financial education studies for context, but these are **not** 
      replications of this specific intervention and design.

      (3) Thus, the criterion **Reproduced** is not met — the results have not been confirmed by 
      an independent replication study.

      care in designing our study to prevent potentially confounding influences.” (p. 15)

      3) “We are grateful to ... for research assistance. ... We thank seminar
      participants ... for valuable suggestions.” (p. 20)

      Analysis:

      (1) Under I (Independent Conduct), the study team implementing and analyzing the
      intervention should be independent from the developers/designers of the
      intervention. In this paper, the same authors appear to have designed the program
      (the learning path, random assignment process) and carried out the evaluation.

      (2) The text does not suggest that an external, third-party evaluator performed the
      trial. Instead, the authors wrote the learning modules themselves, administered
      them, and analyzed the results.

      (3) This does not fulfill the independence requirement because the same research
      group that created the content also tested it. Hence, I is not met.
  p:

      The study was registered after the intervention and data collection were completed, 
      which does not satisfy the criterion for pre-registering the protocol before data collection.

      3) "Initial registration date: September 23, 2019"
      
      Analysis:

      (1) The ERCT Standard requires that the study's protocol be publicly registered before data collection begins. 
      In this case, the intervention and data collection were completed by January 31, 2019, but the study was 
      registered on September 23, 2019.

      (2) Therefore, the criterion for a pre-registered protocol is not met.
