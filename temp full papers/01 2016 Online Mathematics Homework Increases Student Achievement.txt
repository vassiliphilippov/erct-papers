In a randomized field trial with 2,850 seventh-grade mathematics students, we evaluated whether an educational technology
intervention increased mathematics learning. Assigning homework is common yet sometimes controversial. Building on prior
research on formative assessment and adaptive teaching, we predicted that combining an online homework tool with teacher
training could increase learning. The online tool ASSISTments (a) provides timely feedback and hints to students as they do
homework and (b) gives teachers timely, organized information about students’ work. To test this prediction, we analyzed data
from 43 schools that participated in a random assignment experiment in Maine, a state that provides every seventh-grade
student with a laptop to take home. Results showed that the intervention significantly increased student scores on an end-of-
the-year standardized mathematics assessment as compared with a control group that continued with existing homework
practices. Students with low prior mathematics achievement benefited most. The intervention has potential for wider adoption.

for most American middle school students and teachers,
mathematics homework is a regular practice. Typically, a
teacher assigns homework during class, and each student
later completes the assigned math problems. The next day,
the teacher reviews the answers in a full-class discussion.
Students spend a considerable amount of time each week
doing mathematics homework and reviewing homework in
class. Given the stable school policies around homework
(Loveless, 2014) and the meaningful amount of instructional
time allocated to homework, we consider whether the impact
of homework on learning might be increased.
The purpose of mathematics homework is typically to
provide practice for the student. Literature reviews and
meta-analyses show generally positive or neutral effects for
homework on learning (Cooper, Robinson, & Patall, 2006;
Maltese, Robert, & Fan, 2012). Effects due to homework are
more positive in middle and high school than elementary
school (reflecting greater student maturity) and particularly
for mathematics, which requires substantial individual prac-
tice (Eren & Henderson, 2011). Parents and teachers under-
stand the importance of practicing mathematics but
sometimes disagree about the value of school homework
policies. Indeed, popular media and books recurrently cover
debates among parents and schools regarding homework
(e.g., Bennett & Kalish, 2006; Kohn, 2006; Shumaker, 2016;
Wallis, 2006). One prominent issue is that students may not
receive timely feedback or help as they practice. Public dis-
course raises questions about whether homework increases
learning, what kind of homework is more effective, and how
homework may affect students’ well-being (e.g., Fernández-
Alonso, Suárez-Álvarez, & Muñiz, 2015; Galloway & Pope,
2007).
We hypothesized that homework could be improved from
the insights of research on formative assessment and related
strategies (Black & Wiliam, 1998; Boston, 2002). Formative
assessment involves using data from students’ independent
work to give them helpful feedback and guidance while
enabling the teacher to use the data to adjust instruction to
meet students’ learning needs. Frequent use of formative
assessments can improve achievement, particularly when
the results are used to adjust instruction (Bergan, Sladeczek,
Schwarz, & Smith, 1991; Speece, Molloy, & Case, 2003).
Timely, nonevaluative, supportive, and specific feedback
and guidance are beneficial to students (Azevedo & Bernard,
1995; D. L. Butler & Winne, 1995; Shute, 2008). Timely
feedback is better for students than receiving no feedback at
all, and conflicting results suggest that immediate feedback
(Corbett and Anderson, 2001) or slightly delayed feedback

Roschelle et al.
(A. C. Butler, Karpicke, & Roediger, 2007) may be better.
ASSISTments is closely related to the Cognitive Tutor pro-
gram of research (Ritter, Anderson, Koedinger, & Corbett,
2007), which has used immediate feedback successfully to
advance mathematics problem solving for decades. An
extensive literature review suggested that immediate feed-
back may be more useful to students for procedural tasks and
that delayed feedback may be useful for conceptual or trans-
fer tasks (Shute, 2008). The homework tasks in this study are
more procedural.
Likewise, data on the students’ recent performance can
guide teachers to adapt instruction (Marsh, Pane, & Hamilton,
2006; Means, Chen, DeBarger, & Padilla, 2010). In one rigor-
ous study that found a positive effect, teachers collected
answers to mathematics problems from students via net-
worked handheld calculators and used these data to adapt their
instruction to fit students’ needs (Pape et al., 2012). Broadly
speaking, evidence suggests that formative assessment
improves learning outcomes (Black & Wiliam, 1998; Hattie
& Timperley, 2007), although there has been criticism of the
quality of the research (Dunn & Mulvenon, 2009; Kingston &
Nash, 2011). Critics also emphasize the importance of helping
teachers make sense of the results and take appropriate action
(e.g., Bennett, 2011), and they have been cautious about the
expected effect size (Kingston & Nash, 2011), given that
some recent students found no or mixed effects (Carlson,
Borman, & Robinson, 2011; Cordray, Pion, Brandt, & Molefe,
2013; Konstantopoulos, Miller, & van der Ploeg, 2013;
Konstantopoulos, Miller, van der Ploeg, Li, & Traynor, 2011;
Quint, Sepanik, & Smith, 2008). The studies that found no
effect examined interventions that rely on infrequent assess-
ments, such as interim or benchmark tests, and provide feed-
back across many tasks, not the task level. In contrast, the
intervention considered here provides daily feedback to stu-
dents and teachers, and the feedback is at the task level.
Despite mixed results overall, there are good reasons to expect
that a formative assessment could provide benefits for student
learning when (a) the feedback is frequent and at the task level
and (b) teachers are prepared to make sense of and use the
feedback in an instructionally meaningful manner.
In alignment with the literature in mathematics education
that recommend technology for formative assessment
(Drijvers et al., 2016), our study was designed to contribute
to the field by investigating whether technology could
improve student learning by enabling formative assessment
practices related to homework. Although formative assess-
ment is a desirable practice, it is not easy for a mathematics
teacher to provide every student with timely feedback and
guidance or organize student data for instructional decision
making. Generally speaking, technology can provide each
student with timely feedback and hints as one does home-
work, and it can allow additional practice opportunities that
match a student’s individual needs. Technology may help
teachers to adapt instruction by automatically organizing
2
data that indicate which topics deserve more attention, which
students need additional help, and what wrong answers need
to be addressed.
The intervention that we tested combined ASSISTments
(Heffernan & Heffernan, 2014): an online platform that
assists students while they solve mathematics problems,
with related teacher training (described later). ASSISTments
had shown positive results in previous experiments, but
those were relatively short and involved small numbers of
teachers (Kelly et al., 2013; Mendicino, Razzaq, &
Heffernan, 2009; Singh et al., 2011). Although initial experi-
ments were small in scale, ASSISTments has potential for
larger adoption. The ASSISTments approach requires only
modest changes to school and instructional policies. For
example, it is not necessary to change the textbook that is
used, the degree of homework that is assigned, or the pace
and order in which mathematics topics are addressed.
Interventions like this can be delivered at a reasonable cost
as long as students have access to the basic technology—in
this case, a tablet or laptop computer.
We chose to evaluate ASSISTments in Maine because of
the statewide policy that gives every middle school student a
laptop to take home, thus providing equitable access. This
policy has been in place since 2001, yet evidence of impact
on mathematics achievement is limited (Silvernail, Pinkham,
Wintle, Walker, & Bartlett, 2011). As an increasing number
of states and regions deploy technology, it is important to
understand which intervention programs can leverage the
hardware to improve learning.
Research Design
We investigated what happened when teachers in Maine
were newly trained to use ASSISTments and then deployed
it with all their students throughout a full year of seventh-
grade mathematics instruction. Our main research question
was as follows:
Do students in schools that use ASSISTments for mathe-
matics homework learn more than students in schools
who do homework without ASSISTments?
We investigated this question through a randomized con-
trolled experiment in which schools were assigned to either
an intervention or a business-as-usual condition.
Intervention
Worcester Polytechnic Institute provided the ASSISTments
intervention—comprising the technology and closely
related professional development—to schools, teachers, and
students for this study.
The ASSISTments technology is a web-based platform
that is made available to schools without charge. The name
“ASSISTments” intends to convey that the technology gives
students assistance while providing teachers with assess-
ments of what students know and can do. ASSISTments was
developed with funding from the National Science
Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education’s Institute
of Educational Sciences. Three prior research studies involv-
ing small numbers of students and few instructional days are
described here, and they showed that ASSISTments could
have an effect on learning.
In Mendicino et al. (2009), the experiment covered 4 days
of instruction and involved 28 students. The control group
received a worksheet with problems, whereas subjects in the
treatment condition entered their answers online, receiving
scaffolding and hints immediately after answering a problem
wrong. A pre- and posttest measure was developed by the
experimenter in consultation those teaching the content.
Posttest results showed a significant effect of condition, d =
0.6. There were two main differences between the groups in
how they experienced homework during the study: The
treatment group answered homework on a computer and got
immediate feedback, whereas the control group neither
answered homework on a computer nor got immediate feed-
back. In a follow-up study with a similar design involving 63
students over 2 instructional days (Kelly et al., 2013), both
groups answered homework on a computer: One group got
immediate feedback via computer, and the other group
received next-day feedback from a teacher. Students in the
computer-based feedback condition had higher posttest
scores. In another follow-up study (n = 172 students; Singh
et al. 2011), both groups again answered homework ques-
tions on a computer, but the computer-based feedback group
received both correctness feedback and tutorial guidance if
they got a problem wrong, whereas the control group did not
receive computer-based feedback. Again, the students who
received computer-based feedback and tutorial guidance had
higher posttest scores than the students who entered their
answers on a computer without receiving feedback. Overall,
these studies offer preliminary evidence for the effectiveness
of ASSISTments but conflate the timing of feedback (imme-
diate vs. delayed) and the modality of feedback (from a com-
puter or a teacher). The experiments involved less than a
week of instruction, whereas the present study lasted an
entire school year.
Content in ASSISTments consists of mathematics prob-
lems with answers and hints (and, in some cases, more
extensive online guidance on how to solve the problem).
These mathematics problems are bundled into problem sets
that teachers assign to their students. As the students work
online, the computer informs them about the correctness of a
solution and offers guidance, if available for that problem.
Teachers receive reports on how students perform on the
assigned problem sets, including information about common
wrong answers.
Two types of ASSISTments content were included in the
intervention for this study. One type is closely linked to
Online Mathematics Homework
existing textbook homework problems or to related home-
work problems that teachers write themselves. During the
summer, undergraduates entered all the homework problems
into ASSISTments from all the mathematics textbooks used
in the treatment group; thus, each teacher had access to every
homework problem in his or her textbook. The ASSISTments
interface enabled teachers to bundle these into problem sets
to assign to their students.
The second kind of content was specifically developed
for mastery-oriented skill practice and was called “skill
builders.” Existing skill builders in ASSISTments cover
>300 topics in middle school math. Teachers can assign skill
builders to students to provide practice problems that focus
on a targeted skill until they reach a teacher-defined criterion
for correctness (e.g., a streak of three correct answers on
similar math problems). Students can be checked at 1- and
2-week intervals for retention of skills demonstrated on past
problem sets, which links to the research-based instructional
strategy of spaced practice (Pashler et al., 2007). For both
types of content, teachers (rather than the system or inter-
vention developers) decided how much and what type of
homework was assigned, and they were asked to do so in
accordance with their existing school homework policy.
The intervention also incorporated teacher professional
development aimed to increase teachers’ readiness to use
ASSISTments. The target practices included (a) encourag-
ing students to rework problems they initially got wrong
(and to enter revised answers), (b) focusing attention on the
homework problems that students did not answer correctly,
(c) reviewing correct solution processes for the problems
that students found difficult, and (d) discussing common
wrong answers to address underlying misunderstandings.
ASSISTments provides teachers with an easily accessible
report that summarizes student work for a particular assign-
ment in a grid format (Figure 1). The rows of the grid cor-
respond to individual students (if teachers display this report
publically, they can hide student names). The columns of the
grid correspond to individual problems in the assignment
and show the percentage correct for each problem, as well
any common wrong answers that students gave. The color-
coded cells provide information on each student’s perfor-
mance on each problem in a format that focuses on problems
that were difficult for many students. In addition, teachers
can use information about students to form study groups and
address common issues or to work with the students indi-
vidually. The professional development training helps teach-
ers learn to use this information to make instructional
decisions, such as which problem to focus on or which stu-
dent to spend time with. It also coaches teachers to deter-
mine when a topic needs to be retaught or student mastery is
high enough to move on. Consequently, teachers were able
to personalize ASSISTments for individual students, groups
of students, or the whole class; for example, they could
assign additional practice to particular students (e.g., by
3
fIGURE 1. annotations.
A popular ASSISTments report organizes student homework results in a grid—with tasks in columns and students
in rows and enables teachers to quickly identify which problems to review and what the common errors were, as indicated by the
assigning skill builders) or enter other problems or hints to
existing problem sets.
Recruitment, School-Level Attrition, and Demographics
We recruited 46 schools to represent the range of school
sizes and mathematics achievement levels found through-
out Maine. For the recruitment process, we developed a
consistent set of message and presentations, which were
available on a project website and as handouts. The study
was described to teachers as a delayed treatment design:
Some schools would be initially assigned to use
ASSISTments, whereas others would wait 2 years and then
be given training and access to use ASSISTments. We
advertised the study to teachers and school principals
throughout Maine via a mix of bulk mailings, presentations
at statewide events, a webinar hosted by the state’s
Department of Education, visits to schools, personal com-
munication through existing relationships, and some news
coverage. As interested parties were identified, the team
visited each school to make a presentation about the study
and requirements for participation. Interested schools were
required to complete an application form to ensure that
they understood all the requirements of participation and
that teachers and school leaders fully agreed to participate;
in addition, the application form gave the researchers use-
ful demographic data about the schools. All schools that
successfully completed an application were accepted into
the study and randomly assigned to a condition, as described
later. The procedure for recruitment is detailed in an online
technical report (Roschelle et al., 2014).
Attrition is relatively common in experiments that are
fielded in schools and that unfold over a school year or longer.
As planned and executed, this experiment required that schools
remain in the condition for 2 years and provide student data in
the second year. We expected some attrition in the design of the
study and thus recruited more schools than needed.
The specifics of attrition from 46 to 43 schools are as
follows: Most schools were placed into pairs prior to ran-
domization. The pairs were formed by rank ordering
schools by prior test scores and making slight adjustments
to the resulting order when schools of similar rank were of
dissimilar sizes. In one case, a pair was formed, but then
one school dropped out, leaving 45 schools. A new pair
was formed with the remaining school, and we proceeded
with random assignment. One treatment school dropped
out after the start of the project, but its matching control
school did not drop out, leaving 44 schools. We continued
to collect data for the unpaired control school but later
excluded it from analysis because it had lost its matching
treatment school. The net result was 43 schools in the final
analytic sample, consisting of randomly assigned pairs (n =
40) plus three schools that had never been paired and were
individually randomly assigned to treatment (n = 2) or con-
trol (n = 1). The school-level overall attrition rate was
6.5%, and the school-level differential attrition rate was
3.8%. The What Works Clearinghouse (2008) publishes
guidelines on the acceptability of attrition, and these rates
are within its published parameters for attrition. In the Data
Linking section, we provide related information on stu-
dent-level attrition.
The overall demographics of the students in our data sam-
ple of 43 schools are reported in Table 1. We studied only the
seventh-grade students in each school. Both in our sample
and in Maine in general, most students are White, and many
qualify for free and reduced-price lunch (FRL), a common
measure of socioeconomic status. Students with individual-
ized education programs (IEPs), an indicator of the need for
special education services, made up about 12% of our
sample.

Procedure
As discussed, schools were placed into pairs with similar
prior achievement levels and enrollment sizes, and pairs were
randomly assigned to treatment and control. In three cases,
no pair was available at the time of randomization, so we
randomly and independently assigned each to one of the con-
ditions. Both teacher groups were expected to assign and
review mathematics homework for seventh-grade students in
accordance with their local school policies. As previously
described, the content of the homework in both groups came
from the textbooks already in use at each school as well as
from skill builders. The treatment group was immediately
offered the intervention, comprising both the ASSISTments
platform and teacher professional development, as detailed
later. The control group was eventually provided with both
ASSISTments and the same professional development but
after a 2-year delay; thus, it did not have access to
ASSISTments while we were collecting data.
Teachers in the treatment group participated in profes-
sional development training beginning in the summer pre-
ceding the first year of implementation (3 days) and later
throughout the school year (approximately 6 hr across
three classroom visits from an ASSISTments coach).
During the first year of ASSISTments use, the coach
worked with teachers to improve their implementation and
formative assessment practices. Teachers attended a sec-
ond professional development workshop in the summer
between the first and second years (2 days). The coaching
component of the professional development was both in-
person and remote. The coach, who was a member of the
ASSISTments team, visited every teacher in his or her
classroom at least three times (with the exception of a
school located on the far north side of the state of Maine).
The coach also conducted remote webinars two to three
times each year and encouraged all teachers to attend.
Online Mathematics Homework
Last, many teachers took advantage of the opportunity to
occasionally email and call the coach for help during the
school year.
Teachers used ASSISTments with a new cohort of sev-
enth-grade students during the second school year. Scores
from this second cohort of students were used for our analy-
sis of the impact on student learning.
In the control group, teachers continued with their exist-
ing homework practices without any specific teacher train-
ing beyond that offered by their districts. Control group
teachers were not able to use ASSISTments with seventh-
grade students. Teachers knew that after the 2-year experi-
ment ended, they would be invited to attend professional
development training for ASSISTments and use it without
cost. Thus, via a delayed treatment design, the study pro-
vided all schools with a similar incentive while maintain-
ing an intervention contrast during the first 2 years.
Measures
To measure students’ levels of achievement prior to
intervention, we obtained data from the state of Maine
under an approved institutional review board and data
security plan. The data included students’ achievement on
the New England Common Assessment Program (NECAP)
test for reading and mathematics. The data also included
demographic indicators, such as gender, FRL status, and
IEP status. During the fielding of this experiment, the state
of Maine phased out NECAP but was not yet administering
Smarter Balanced, the replacement Common Core exami-
nation. Hence, we could not rely on a state-administered
test as an outcome measure. To measure students’ levels of
achievement at the end of the intervention, we adminis-
tered the TerraNova standardized test. We chose TerraNova
because it has well-established and reputable psychometric
qualities. The developers of ASSISTments did not make
any changes to the content of their intervention to align
with TerraNova, nor was TerraNova selected with an
expectation that there was an especially strong alignment
with ASSISTments.
NECAP. Mathematics scores from the NECAP test were
used as the measure of students’ knowledge. NECAP was
developed in response to the federal No Child Left Behind
Act of 2001 (2002). The NECAP test is considered a well-
designed assessment with strong technical qualities. Maine
administered the NECAP test once each year from Grades 3
through 8 to comply with the act. NECAP data were col-
lected by the state of Maine for students when they were in
sixth grade, which was the year before they were first
exposed to the intervention. Due to the transition from
NECAP to Common Core–based testing, the last available
scores for our students were sixth-grade scores; we used the
most recent available data.
5
Roschelle et al.
TerraNova. Scores from the TerraNova Common Core
assessment mathematics test were used as a primary out-
come measure to provide data on student achievement in
mathematics concepts, processes, and skills, and the test was
administered at the end of students’ seventh-grade year. This
achievement test is published by Data Recognition Corpora-
tion CTB and is nationally normed.
According to the publisher, TerraNova’s content is
aligned with the Common Core Standards for Mathematics
and represents mathematics curriculum taught throughout
the United States. During the time of this experiment,
schools in Maine were transitioning from prior instructional
frameworks to the Common Core. The TerraNova content is
appropriate for the transitional period because it is largely
consistent with existing instructional practices but focuses
on grade-level expectations in the Common Core. The
TerraNova mathematics test at Level 17 is appropriate for
Grade 7; it has 37 items and requires 1.5 hr to administer.
This instrument combines selected-response items with sec-
tions of constructed-response items that allow students to
produce short and extended responses. It generates norm-
referenced achievement scores, criterion-referenced objec-
tive mastery scores, and achievement-level information that
includes five levels of proficiency. We used the norm-refer-
enced achievement scores, which are units of a single equal-
interval scale that extends across 12 years of schooling.
Teachers were trained to administer the TerraNova math-
ematics test at the end of the second year of implementation
in both cohorts of schools. Training and administration of
the test occurred near the end of the school year. The test
booklets were then returned to the test publisher for scoring.
The test publisher (blind to condition) scored the test book-
lets and reported the scale scores to us.
System use data. The electronic records collected by the
ASSISTments system are a source of implementation data in
the treatment group. For each classroom, the system collects
data for each student on each day at an individual action level
(e.g., when a student enters an answer or requests a hint). In
addition to data about student usage, the system collects data
on teacher usage. Using these data, we confirmed that all
treatment group teachers used ASSISTments, and we found
no evidence that control teachers were using the system.
Data Analysis
Data Linking and Student-Level Attrition
Students and parents were first notified about the study
when students entered seventh grade and were exposed to
the intervention (treatment group only). Teachers, however,
began the study with a warm-up year, while student partici-
pants were still in sixth grade. Hence, for the purpose of
counting the students who left a study school or joined a
study school, we began with the student population as of the
6
first semester of sixth grade. Although we have no evidence
of this occurring, it is theoretically possible that a sixth-
grade student or parent would have learned about the sev-
enth-grade study and decided to change schools, and this
conservative method of determining the populations would
count such students as joining or leaving the study.
In the first semester of sixth grade, 3,035 students were in
a study school. Of these, 2,728 completed the study by tak-
ing a TerraNova assessment at the end of seventh grade.
Hence, 307 exited the study because they left a study school
or skipped the TerraNova assessment. Of the 307 leavers,
178 were in the control group and 129 in the treatment group.
The student-level attrition is thus 10.1% overall, with 5.6%
differential attrition between groups. Compared with the
What Works Clearinghouse (2008) model for differential
attrition, this level of attrition fits within the zone considered
to be acceptable with regard to potential bias.
In addition, 122 students (61 in the control group and 61 in
the treatment group) joined a study school, had available
NECAP scores, and completed the study by taking the TerraNova
assessment. (Later we report an analysis of whether our findings
are sensitive to the addition of joiners and further justify our
decision to include them in our analysis.) Thus, our total study
sample size was 2,850 (the sum of 122 and 2,728) with 1,621 in
the treatment group and 1,229 in the control group.
Baseline Equivalence of Groups
Analyses found no difference between the treatment and
control groups in various demographic and predictor vari-
ables. Multilevel logistic models found no control-versus-
treatment condition differences in student-level FRL status,
γ = 0.012, t(21) = 0.121, p = .905; non-White/non-Hispanic
heritage, γ = −0.219, t(21) = −0.809, p = .427; IEP status, γ
= −0.013, t(21) = −0.115, p = .910; and student sex, γ =
0.100, t(21) = 1.747, p = .095. Multilevel regression found
no treatment condition differences in prior year math perfor-
mance, γ = 0.194, t(21) = 0.463, p = .648, or prior year read-
ing performance, γ = −0.139, t(21) = −0.177, p = .861.
Use of ASSISTments
We tracked usage of ASSISTments directly via system
log files. Students in the ASSISTments condition used the
system, on average, for 967 mathematics problems and for
14 hr in the course of a school year. We had expected 18 to
24 hr of use in the course of the year, by estimating that
homework assignments could be completed in about 10 min
and would be assigned three to four nights each week.
Analytic Models
To estimate the impacts of the intervention on student
learning, we developed analytic models that reflect the clus-
tering of students. We primarily report results from a
hierarchical linear regression model (HLM) with two levels:
students nested within schools. In most of the schools in our
sample, there is only one teacher for seventh-grade mathe-
matics; thus, in these schools, there is no distinction between
the school and teacher level. Furthermore, the two- and three-
level models produced similar statistical results. In our
primary HLM, we included the following variables as
student-level covariates: prior NECAP mathematics
(PriorMath), NECAP reading scores (PriorRead), FRL status,
and IEP status. The school-level covariates included are the
school’s mean prior NECAP mathematics score (SchMath)
and 20 school-pair variables (SchPair), indicating which
school pair a school belonged to. The three schools not paired
before randomization were treated as their own cluster.
All analyses were conducted with students’ TerraNova-
scaled scores as the dependent (outcome) variable. The two-
level HLM that predicts student TerraNova performance is
as follows:

Using a separate model, we also analyzed whether
ASSISTments benefited students with low or high prior math-
ematics achievement differently. Using the sixth-grade
NECAP mathematics scores, we divided students into groups
with scores at or below the median (low prior achievement) or
above the median (high prior achievement). An HLM used the
treatment condition and the binary prior-math-performance
Online Mathematics Homework
variable as predictors of seventh-grade TerraNova scores,
controlling for student-level FRL status, student-level IEP sta-
tus, school-level prior-year mean NECAP mathematics
scores, and the 20 school-pair variables. This model evaluated
the interaction between prior achievement status and being in
the treatment condition.
Results
We first provide the results from fitting the data to the
primary HLM and then consider the impact on students with
low prior mathematics achievement.
Modeling Student Achievement
We modeled student achievement and tested statistical
significance using the primary HLM described above. Two-
and three-level models gave similar statistical results. We
report the results for the simpler two-level model.
When we controlled for student-level covariates (prior
math and reading achievement, FRL status, and IEP status),
the treatment students’ adjusted mean TerraNova scale score
was 8.84 points higher than the control students’ model-
adjusted mean scale score of 681.95. This difference is statis-
tically significant, t(20) = 2.992, p = .007. Further details of
the model results appear in Table 2. As a check on the reason-
ableness of the statistical model, we also examined the unad-
justed difference in mean TerraNova scores between groups.
The unadjusted difference between the mean scores of the
two conditions was slightly greater, 11 points, and also
favored the treatment group. We then computed an effect size
using the adjusted difference in scaled scores and the pooled
standard deviation of the scores in our overall seventh-grade
sample. The difference of 8.84 points corresponds to an effect
size of 0.18 standard deviation units (we used Hedges’s g as
our measure of effect size throughout the analyses).
We also examined the sensitivity of the impact findings to
the inclusion of 122 students who joined the study after their
school was randomly assigned to a treatment condition. To do
so, we reanalyzed the data using the same HLM but without
these 122 students in the sample. The findings are essentially
the same (see Table 3); the adjusted mean difference between
groups is 8.57 and remains statistically significant (p = .01).
We report the main findings based on a sample that includes
joiners, for three reasons. First, this intervention has low risk
for bias due to the inclusion of joiners in the analytic sample.
All schools in Maine already send students home with laptops
for the purpose of doing homework; thus, laptops were given
to students in both conditions. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a
student would change schools because a teacher in one school
subject (math) uses a particular application for homework; in
general, students are tolerant of a variety of applications that
their teachers ask them to use on the school-assigned laptop
and are unlikely to change schools just to obtain or avoid a
particular application used only in mathematics classes.

Second, we did not detect a threat to internal validity due to the
presence of joiners. The joiners were equally distributed across
treatment groups; their average prior math test scores were also
similar across groups, t(120) = 1.085, p = .280; and the impact
results are very similar with and without joiners in the sample.

control group (see Table 4). The interaction is statistically
significant, t(2770) = 2.432, p = .015; the effect of the
ASSISTments intervention is greater for lower-performing
students than for higher-performing students (see Figure 2).
We calculated effect sizes for each group using the pooled
standard deviation for the total sample. The corresponding
effect sizes were .29 for those students at or below the
median and .12 for those students above the median.
Students With Low and High Prior Achievement
For those students with NECAP scores at or below the

was 13.35 points higher than that in the control group. For
the students who started above the median, the mean score in
the treatment group was 5.84 points higher than that in the
Discussion
Compared with the business-as-usual control group, we
found that achievement was higher in the schools that used
the online homework intervention comprising ASSISTments
and related teacher professional development. Furthermore,
the intervention provided a greater benefit to students with
lower, rather than higher, prior mathematics achievement.

fIGURE 2. Students were divided into low and high groups based
on prior achievement scores. The results shown are the observed
TerraNova scores. In both groups, the students in treatment
schools obtained higher TerraNova scores. The difference between
treatment and control groups was greater for students with lower
prior achievement, t(2770) = 2.432, p = .015. The TerraNova is
scaled from 0 to 1,000, from kindergarten through the end of high
school. However, this experiment concerned only the seventh-
grade test, which uses a smaller range of possible scale scores. We
scaled the vertical axis to show the minimum possible score on the
seventh-grade test (487) at the low end of the axis and the largest
observed results on the high end.
To interpret this effect size of 0.18 standard deviations, we
considered standard guidance (Lipsey et al., 2012). We noted
that the gains due to the intervention were greater in magni-
tude than the difference in scores between students with and
without FRL status; thus, the effect is meaningful relative to
the size of achievement gaps among students with different
levels of socioeconomic status. The magnitude of the effect
can also be described in terms of an improvement index:
Students at the 50th percentile without the intervention would
improve to the 58th percentile if they received the
ASSISTments treatment. (An improvement index is the
expected percentile gain for the average student in the control
group—the student who scored at the 50th percentile on the
outcome measure—if that student had attended a school
where the intervention was implemented.)
We also examined how the difference in means on the
TerraNova translates to differences on a grade-level scale.
Terra Nova scores are scaled such that the mean score in a
nationally normed sample increases by a modest number of
scale points per school year. For example, the mean scale
scores for the test publisher’s nationally normed sample at
the beginning of sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth grades are
655, 670, 678, and 690, respectively (an average difference
of 11.66 points per year). In the context of these modest
expected differences, the measured difference of 8.84 scale
score points is meaningful.
This intervention was designed for use by all students in
a school. Some interventions target particular identified pop-
ulations, such as students with needs for special education,
students whose performances are below grade level, or stu-
dents with poor language skills. In contrast, this intervention
followed typical homework policies, which apply to all stu-
dents. A notable effect size is less likely when the treated
population is inclusive, as some students in the population
will probably do well without any specific intervention.
Indeed, we found that the benefit was smaller for students
with above-median prior mathematics achievement. It is rea-
sonable to expect that students with high prior mathematics
achievement may be doing well on homework without any
special supports. Yet school stakeholders are frequently con-
cerned about fairness; thus, schools often prefer interven-
tions that can be offered to all students and that have the
potential of benefiting all students. Hence, a desirable fea-
ture of this experiment is that the intervention was assigned
to all seventh-grade students in a school and that a meaning-
ful impact was nonetheless obtained.
There were several limitations of this study. First, the
state of Maine provides laptops to all seventh-grade stu-
dents; other settings might have less or variable access to
technology. Inequitable access to technology within the
treatment condition might result in smaller effects. Second,
Maine is more rural and homogeneous than many other
states and regions; results could vary in other regions. Third,
teachers had one school year to improve their quality of
implementation before we measured impact in a second
school year. Implementations that seek results quickly or
provide less teacher support may result in smaller or differ-
ent effects.
Within the scope of this report, we are also limited in the
degree to which we can identify specific mechanisms
within the intervention that were most closely related to the
effects observed. The project collected several additional
data sources that provide insight on possible mechanisms,
but the analysis and integration of this additional qualita-
tive and quantitative data require further work. For exam-
ple, in further analysis we plan to use additional data from
teacher interviews, surveys, and instructional logs to con-
sider whether variations in the type and amount of home-
work might explain effects. It is possible that students
9
Roschelle et al.
spent more or less time on homework in the treatment con-
dition (i.e., when using ASSISTments) than the business-
as-usual condition. We do not expect this to be the case,
because the amount of homework assigned was set by
school policies on homework and we found the policies to
be similar among schools in our sample (Fairman, Porter,
& Fisher, 2015). It could also be that the content of the
homework was different; however, this is also unlikely
because teachers in both conditions assigned homework
from their textbooks. We will be examining the extent to
which the additional skill builder content offered in the
ASSISTments treatment group (but not the control group)
might explain the findings.
In further analysis, we plan to look at the extent to which
changes in student learning were mediated by changes in
teacher behavior, by analyzing and integrating additional
data from observations, interviews, surveys, and instruc-
tional logs. Students may receive a direct benefit from the
feedback and hints that they receive in ASSISTments as they
do homework, regardless of whether their teacher’s behavior
is different during classroom instruction; however, teachers
can use the reports generated by ASSISTments to adapt their
teaching based on their students’ work. There is some pre-
liminary indication that teachers did change their behavior,
but due to the complexity of analyzing and integrating the
multiple qualitative and quantitative data sources to address
this issue, comprehensive analysis of this issue will await a
subsequent research effort.
Conclusion
In this study, an online mathematics homework interven-
tion produced a positive impact on students’ mathematics
achievement at the end of a school year. Students with low,
rather than high, prior achievement benefited more. The
intervention provided students with personalized feedback
and hints immediately—more typically, students wait until
the next day to know what they did right and wrong and to
get help. When students struggled, they had additional
opportunities to work toward mastery in supplementary
problem sets. The intervention also enabled formative
assessment practices for teachers, such as adapting their dis-
cussions of homework to fit students’ needs. Specific profes-
sional development was provided to teachers to enable them
to enact these adaptive practices. Formative assessment is a
frequently recommended practice; this intervention pro-
vided a practical, targeted way to do it.
Our findings are relevant to many schools because math-
ematics homework is a commonplace school policy and
school stakeholders often critique the value of existing
homework practices. This study demonstrates one way to
improve the value of homework. Furthermore, the tested
intervention fit within common school policies for home-
work and did not require change in instructional policies,
such as the school’s choice of textbook or pacing through
10
topics. Thus, the intervention was targeted and modest:
Teachers were not expected to change their entire reper-
toire of classroom routines. Although reformers often pro-
mote more ambitious changes to classroom routines (e.g.,
“flipped classrooms”), such changes in teaching practice
require much more intensive teacher training and can meet
resistance. Here, teachers continued to make the majority
of instructional decisions following their own approach in
accordance with existing school policy. An intervention
that mostly fits existing school policies is typically easier
for schools to adopt.
Interventions like this one can also bring new personal-
ized options to schools. Schools tend to have a uniform
homework policy for all students, and teachers can assign
mathematics homework to all students in ASSISTments.
However, students’ assignments need not be identical.
Students who show mastery of a particular topic after just
a few minutes could perhaps do only a few problems that
are likely to be discussed with the full class the next day
(so they get some practice and can participate in class dis-
cussion). Other students may benefit from more intensive
practice opportunities as well as specific skill builder
exercises or other resources. ASSISTments and similar
technology could help mathematics teachers assign some
problems uniformly while personalizing some assign-
ments so that particular students have additional opportu-
nities to learn. Although the potential to combine elements
of uniformity and personalization seems promising, an
empirical basis for recommending exactly how to opti-
mize this mix of homework assignments remains a topic
for further research.
