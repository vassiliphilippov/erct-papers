  "abstract": "Using a computer-based learning environment, the present paper studied the effects of adaptive instruction and elaborated feedback on the learning outcomes of secondary school students in a financial education program. We randomly assigned schools to four conditions on a crossing of two factors: the type of instruction (uniform or adaptive) and feedback (verification or elaborated). A total of 1,177 students in 32 schools completed the program in ability groups in the classroom. The results showed that the program, on average, enhanced the financial knowledge of students by almost half of a standard deviation. No significant changes in students’ financial behavior were found. Despite the promise of adaptive practices to address the individual needs of students, we observed no additional learning gains associated with adaptive instruction and elaborated feedback. A marginally significant heterogeneous effect for gender was reported, where girls were negatively affected by adaptive instruction. Moreover, despite our sample included more students from a favorable socioeconomic status, the adaptive practices seemed to lower the motivation level. Hence, while no information on the time spent on the instruction and feedback was retrieved, the latter finding suggested that the practices may have been perceived as burdensome by students, thereby rendering them ineffective.",

Under the ERCT Standard, school-level randomization is considered stronger than class-level randomization, and therefore it automatically satisfies the requirement for class-level RCT. The authors wrote, “We randomly assigned schools to four conditions…,” indicating an entire school (rather than individual students or only certain classes) was the randomized unit.\n(2) Since randomization at the school level generally eliminates the possibility that some classes within the same school might receive the same intervention (risking contamination), it also meets or exceeds the requirement of randomizing entire classes. If this were strictly a within-class randomization, we would be worried about contamination.\n(3) The study’s explicit mention of the desire to “avoid contamination effects” is precisely the rationale behind not randomizing at the student level within the same classroom. Hence, the stronger school-level RCT satisfies the ‘C - Class-level RCT’ criterion.\n",

The authors do not reference any widely recognized state or national standardized exam.” (pp. 5–7)\n\nAnalysis:\n(1) The ERCT Standard requires an exam-based assessment that is standardized and not created solely by the researchers for the purpose of the study. In this paper, the authors used a set of multiple-choice items, partly drawn from well-known financial literacy surveys (e.g., Lusardi & Mitchell), but there is no clear statement that these test items amount to a recognized, official standardized exam.\n(2) The paper notes that the tests contained custom questions measuring financial literacy in alignment with the program content (saving, risk, inflation, interest, etc.). Although referencing prior published items, the overall instrument appears to be a researcher-assembled mix, not a standard or official test used in large-scale educational assessments.\n(3) The authors do not claim to have employed any “state-wide standardized test” or official exam validated for large-scale usage beyond their own study. Therefore, the exam-based assessment criterion, as defined by the ERCT Standard (which typically refers to established national or international standardized tests), is not satisfied.\n",
