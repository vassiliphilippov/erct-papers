1 Improving Quality of Teaching and Learning in Classes
2 by using Augmented Reality Video
3 Abstract
4 This study contributes to enhancing students’ learning experience and increasing their
5 understanding of complex issues by incorporating an augmented reality (AR) mobile
6 application (app) into a sewing workshop in which a threading task was carried out to
7 facilitate better learning relative to a conventional approach. Participants included 46
8 freshmen. One group of students was provided with a handout, while the other was
9 asked to view an AR video. Questionnaires were then administered, and the results
10 showed a significant difference between the two groups in terms of their
11 understanding of the task. This finding was consistent with the post-test scores and
12 the time required to learn the threading task. Several feedback items indicated higher
13 learning efficiency with the use of AR videos.

16 1. Introduction
17 The most common form of teaching is direct information transfer from the teacher
18 to the students. Traditionally, large classes in post-secondary educational settings are
19 taught in the form of a lecture, which is unidirectional; teaching is presented through
20 PowerPoints, handouts, websites and so on. In some circumstances, when
21 three-dimensional (3D) concepts are presented, students may find it difficult to gain a
22 thorough understanding when only a two-dimensional medium is used for teaching
23 (Stull, Gainer and Hegarty, 2017). According to the ability-as-enhancer hypothesis,
24 learners with high spatial ability would benefit from 3D visualizations in learning.
25 This hypothesis further proposes that learners with low spatial would perform less
26 optimally with 3D concepts since most of these learners have difficulties in mentally
27 constructing visualizations (Huk, 2006). Even students with a normal spatial ability
28 have to exert more effort when learning 3D concepts compared to other types of
29 concepts. Some researchers have indicated that high-quality teaching and learning
30 requires active engagement with students (Billings & Halstead, 2015; Lam & Muldner,
31 2017). However, when conventional teaching methods are used to teach 3D concepts,
32 students often lose interest, engage less during lessons, or miss classes. This view was
33 supported by Mulryan-Kyne (2010), who found that many students tend to skip class
34 and even purchase the lecture notes instead of attending class if they have had issues 
MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
35 with the teaching concepts. Inevitably, student ratings of these courses are
36 substantially low.
37 Additionally, Mintah (2014), Mulryan-Kyne (2010) and Yelkpieri, Namale,
38 Esia-Donkon and Ofosu-Dwamera (2012) indicated that it is much more difficult for
39 teachers to focus individually on each student and address his/her specific needs when
40 class sizes are large. As a result, not all students can follow the pace of teachers well.
41 Yelkpieri et al. (2012) indicated that smaller group learning encourages students to
42 fully participate in the classroom, and it is much easier for teachers to assess their
43 taught lessons in small classes than in large ones. However, students may still find it
44 difficult to control their own pace of study in class and to review more difficult
45 content through other learning mediums after class aside from handouts.
46 Recently, virtual technology has become one of the most popular trends in daily
47 life. It is used for entertainment purposes as well as in the fields of physics, medicine
48 and education (Friess, Oliver, Quak & Lau, 2016). For example, virtual technology
49 can transport students and immerse them into a different setting through virtual reality
50 (VR) or allow them to view pop-up images through augmented reality (AR).
51 According to Milgram et al. (1995), there are three kinds of technologies: AR, VR and
52 augmented virtuality (AV). AR augments natural feedback with simulating cues to the
53 operator. In VR, participants are “immersed in a completely synthetic world” (p.283).
54 In AV environments, the “primary world being experienced is predominantly virtual”
55 (p.283). In addition, AR allows the amalgamation of computer graphics, in which
56 visuals and multimedia information are overlaid onto a real-world scene (Healey &
57 Jenkins, 2000). Sometimes, a hybrid form of these technologies refers to virtual
58 spaces with both images and real physical objects (Regenbrecht et al., 2003). In
59 summary, AR is closer to the real world; digital graphics, sounds and haptic feedback
60 are added and superimposed onto the natural world in AR. In contrast, VR and AV
61 provide a completely contained digital experience.
62 The concept of AR technology is not new. Studies on AR technology in
63 educational settings have highlighted many advantages in teaching and learning
64 (Akçayır and Akçayır, 2017; Radu, 2012). One of the reasons of why AR technology is
65 so widely used is because it no longer requires expensive hardware and equipment.
66 This technology can be used with computers and mobile phones. One significant
67 advantage of using AR technology in education is the enhancement of students’
68 learning achievement (Chang, Hou, Pan, Sung, & Chang, 2015; Ferrer-Torregrosa et
69 al., 2015). It can also provide immediate and relevant information such as videos and 
MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
70 3D images to students in order to facilitate their processing skills and increase their
71 learning motivation and level of understanding (Chiang, Yang & Hwang, 2014; Yoon,
72 Elinich, Wang, Steinmeier, & Ticker, 2012).
73 Nevertheless, the use of AR technology in education is not without its challenges.
74 For instance, the difficulty and time consumption of using AR applications are
75 commonly reported (Gavish et al., 2015), particularly without well-designed
76 interfaces (Munoz-Cristobal el al, 2015). Although many AR technologies have been
77 developed for education, only a few of them have been developed for real classroom
78 environments (Cuendet, Bonnard, Do-Lenh, & Dillenbourg, 2013). The aim of this
79 study is therefore to show how AR technology is implemented in classroom and
80 laboratory settings in the discipline of textiles and clothing. It offers an alternative
81 approach in pedagogy for students’ learning, with the purposes of enhancing their
82 learning experience and increasing their level of understanding of complex issues
83 through the effective use of augmented multimedia. A combination of different types
84 of multimedia sources, including 3D spatial models, images, textual information,
85 videos, animations and sound is adopted, to superimpose digital contents into student
86 learning environments through AR application but only AR video is focused in this
87 study. Although the use of AR in education offers many learning benefits, the focus of
88 this study is primarily on the effectiveness of the pedagogical design through a
89 complicated knitting process involving three different types of knitting needles,
90 knitting movements, and threading processes. The effect of this technology was
91 compared with a conventional teaching approach to determine whether it increased
92 students’ attentiveness and, as a result, facilitated motivation and aroused students’
93 interest in learning in this discipline.
94
95 2. Methodology
96 2.1 Traditional video vs. AR video
97 Video clip is one of traditional methods of presenting teaching materials in
98 classroom. The advantages of traditional video clips brings advantages for students,
99 such as increasing memory, comprehension, and deeper learning, comparing with just
100 using handouts (Berk, 2009). However, there are few limitations of playing traditional
101 videos that cannot be ignored. According to previous studies of Krammer et al. (2006)
102 and Sherin (2004), traditional videos just show the limited excerpt from a reality based
103 on the focus and the angle of the camera. Some information may not be fully captured
104 by the camera even though it has been happening in classroom or laboratory. To cope 
MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
105 with such situation, AR video has been developed and applied in education that
106 provides superimposed and 360-degree graphics on the real environment for students
107 with tapping their fingers. Unlike the approach of using traditional videos (or QR
108 codes), where users can click each link (or scan each code) individually, students using
109 AR technology were only required to move their mobile phone slightly to activate the
110 next AR symbols once they completed their previous learning task. In order to shift the
111 mode of learning from passive to active and engaged learning, the education goal of
112 this study is to foster a habit in students to view learning as a vital component of their
113 everyday life, and relevant not only in the formal educational context, but also in
114 everyday work, socialising, and play.
115
116 2.2 Research framework
117 To apply AR to the learning environment, a mobile application (app) called ITC
118 VR AR was developed by the Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) of The Hong
119 Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). This app can be installed through the App
120 Store (for iPhone users) or Google Play (for Android users) without cost. Multimedia
121 sources such as 3D spatial models and videos are shown when certain symbols are
122 scanned by the AR tool in ITC VR AR. VR videos with a 360° view can also be
123 watched through a VR tool, but is not included as part of this study and will not be
124 discussed here.
125 To reduce selection bias and obtain more accurate results, a randomized controlled
126 trial (RCT) was run. Study participants were randomly allocated to two different
127 groups: either the intervention group, which adopted AR videos in learning, or the
128 control group, which used conventional handouts. The same teaching materials and
129 resources (i.e., handouts and AR videos) were made available to all students after the
130 trial so that they could enjoy the same benefits of undergoing different forms of
131 learning; i.e., no students was excluded from the possibility of receiving good
132 pedagogy.
133 Conceptual learning and spatial learning are the two focuses of the learning
134 evaluation in this study, in accordance with Hakan and Fatih (2015). To evaluate the
135 effectiveness of using AR technology in education, students’ level of understanding
136 regarding the characteristics of three main types of knitting needles as well as their
137 knitting movements were examined by comparing students who read a handout versus
138 those who used the mobile app.
139 A simple test on the different types of knitting needles was given on 15 September 
MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
140 2017 in two of the tutorial classes of Intimate Textiles and Accessories with two
141 groups of Year 3 students. The students were required to answer questions about
142 knitting needles. Then, one group of students was provided with a handout (Group A)
143 with instructions, while the other group of students (Group B) was asked to download
144 the mobile app ITC VR AR prior to the AR learning process. After the performance of
145 the two groups was analysed, the students were administered a threading task in
146 sewing workshops from 26 to 29 September 2017. Both the handout and AR videos
147 were used as a trial, with the same structure as the simple test on the different types of
148 knitting needles. Their performance was then assessed, and they were given a
149 questionnaire.
150
151 2.3 Simple Test on Different Types of Knitting Needles
152 To evaluate whether AR videos are able to produce better learning outcomes for
153 students, a simple test on three main types of knitting needles – compound, latch and
154 bearded needles – was given. The test comprised two sections: one on basic
155 terminology and the other on understanding knitting action. The former contained five
156 multiple-choice questions assessing basic knowledge of the three types of needles,
157 with a maximum score of 5 points. The latter required the students to place the steps
158 of the knitting procedure that used the compound and bearded needles in the correct
159 order. The steps were provided so the students were just required to indicate the order
160 by using a letter (A, B, C, etc.). Every two connected and correct answers were given
161 a score of 1. A full score of 12 was given if the needle movement steps were arranged
162 correctly and sequentially. No exact wordings were used on the test paper to prevent
163 students from merely finding or even copying the answers with similar terms from the
164 handout without actually understanding them well.
165 An RCT was run to prevent bias and increase the accuracy of the results. A
166 flow diagram of this simple test is provided in Figure 1.
167
168 2.3.1 Subject Group
169 Forty-four Year 3 students who were studying at the ITC and had been
170 learning about the principles behind the use of different types of knitting needles and
171 their characteristics in their tutorial class called Intimate Textiles and Accessories
172 were invited to participate in the simple test. To ensure that all students did not have
173 prior adequate knowledge of knitting process, knitwear design specialism students
174 were excluded because they may have already studied similar topics in earlier years of 
MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
175 study. Therefore, only 43 students took part in the simple test.
176 To randomly allocate the study participants into the two groups, all students
177 were randomly allocated into different Intimate Textiles and Accessories classes by
178 the PolyU computer system, which randomly selected the tutorial class designated
179 Group A (received handouts) or Group B (viewed AR videos). Therefore, all
180 participants were blind to the study in that they did not have information about the
181 learning tool until they started their tutorial class. All students who took part in the
182 study were female, with 22 and 21 students in Groups A and B, respectively.
183
184 2.3.2 Learning Process
185 The same test was prepared for both groups of students. A handout with
186 instructions on the use of the three main types of knitting needles was provided to
187 each student in Group A. A part of the handout is shown in Figure 2.
188 Group B students were required to download and install the ITC VR AR mobile
189 app to learn how needles move and operate in a knitting machine (Figure 3). A sheet
190 showing a knitting machine with 4 AR symbols was provided to the Group B students.
191 The aim of this sheet is to provide an overview for students to understand exactly the
192 process happened in which part of the machine and enable them to understand how the
193 machine works as a whole. Once the symbol was scanned by the installed app on the
194 digital device, related videos appeared on the screen. These videos were short and
195 within a minute in length. The students were allowed to control the video by tapping
196 on the buttons at the bottom of the screen and learn at their own pace by tapping the
197 pause button.
198 During the trial, both groups of students were allowed to answer the questions with
199 their learning tool (handout or AR video) and even use an electronic dictionary if
200 needed. To ensure fairness, no discussion among the students was allowed. Since
201 there was no time limit, the students were encouraged to try their best to understand
202 the contents and answer all of the questions. The students were to raise their hand
203 when they completed the test. Their score was provided after the test. The aim was to
204 assess the learning outcomes of both groups and determine the effectiveness of using
205 AR videos for educational purposes.
206
207 2.4 Threading Task
208 After the learning performance of students who took the simple test was analysed,
209 another trial on basic terminology and understanding of the threading process was 
MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
210 designed to evaluate the learning efficiency of using AR videos. The results obtained
211 in the simple test on the knitting needles led to the use of a threading task to further
212 determine the learning outcome of using AR videos.
213 To obtain a better idea on how well the students understood the threading process
214 of an industrial sewing machine, a threading task was designed and administered to
215 two groups of ITC freshmen through either a handout or an AR video. An RCT was
216 also run to avoid bias and obtain more accurate results. The flow diagram of this task
217 is shown in Figure 4.
218
219 2.4.1 Subject Group
220 All 97 freshmen who were studying at ITC and had not yet learned how to operate
221 a professional sewing machine were invited to participate in a sewing workshop for
222 the threading task. Six sessions with different timeslots were offered to the students,
223 and they could choose one of the six. A voluntary research trial (threading task) would
224 be held during the sewing workshop, which was mentioned on the poster. Forty-six
225 freshmen registered and enrolled in the trial.
226 To avoid bias and ensure the accuracy of this study, the students were randomly
227 allocated into groups. Those who enrolled in Sessions 2, 3 or 5 were placed into
228 Group A, whereas students who signed up for Sessions 1, 4 or 6 were placed into
229 Group B. All participants were blind to the study such that no one knew there were
230 two different learning tools for the threading task. As a randomized method was used
231 for the subject distribution, the number of students in Groups A and B was not the
232 same in this study. There were 27 (4 males and 23 females) and 19 (all females)
233 students in Groups A and B, respectively.
234
235 2.4.2 Learning Process
236 2.4.2.1 Pre-test for freshmen
237 To evaluate the learning efficiency and ensure accuracy in analysing the
238 learning performance of the students, a pre-test was carried out before the students
239 received the handout or downloaded the AR videos. The aim was to assess their
240 inherent sewing knowledge and ability, which could help gauge whether there was
241 similarity with their actual performance. The students were required to thread a flat
242 sewing machine (Figure 5) without any prompting or instructions. Regardless of their
243 allocated group, all students had to finish the task but were not given a time limit.
244 They raised their hand when they completed the threading. The time required for each 
MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
245 student to finish the task was recorded, whereas the score depended on each threading
246 step. The threading task was separated into 16 steps, and a score of 16 was the
247 maximum.
248
249 2.4.2.2 Post-test for Freshmen
250 After the students received their score for the pre-test, all of them took part in
251 a post-test. A traditional handout with instructions on how to thread a sewing machine
252 was provided to Group A, which is shown in Figure 6.
253 Group B students were asked to download the same app, ITC VR AR, as that
254 used in the previous simple test on knitting needles. The students scanned a symbol
255 on the sewing machine, and the AR component of the app displayed a video that
256 would allow them to learn about threading (Figure 6). The entire threading process
257 was shown on the video. As with the videos in the simple test on knitting needles,
258 there were buttons on the bottom left of the screen that could be tapped, such as a
259 pause and replay button, so that the students learned at their own pace.
260
261 During the post-test, both groups of students were allowed to thread a machine
262 by using their learning tool (handout or AR video). As with the simple test on knitting
263 needles, they were allowed to consult an electronic dictionary. When the students
264 finished threading, their time spent carrying out the task and their score were
265 recorded.
266
267 2.4.3 Questionnaire
268 A short questionnaire was designed to collect feedback on both types of
269 learning experiences as well as students’ opinions on the designed mobile app and the
270 traditional handout. A specific set of questions was created and tailored for each group
271 of students to avoid bias. All key words in the questionnaire did not suggest that there
272 were two different learning tools. Thus, the eleven questions in both questionnaires
273 were basically the same.
274 The questionnaires were distributed to all 46 students (4 males and 42 females)
275 who enrolled in the sewing workshop. The return percentage of the questionnaires
276 was 100%.
277 Five of the eleven questions in the questionnaire focused on personal
278 information. The other six asked about the learning experience of the threading task,
279 including the challenges that the students encountered with their learning tool, the 
MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
280 difficulty level of the task with the provided learning tool, six factors related to
281 learning (including learning interest, engagement, active learning, level of
282 understanding, pace of learning, and academic outcome), and the extent to which the
283 participants would like to have the respective learning tool applied in their sewing
284 class or even extended to other lessons.
285 Four of the questions that focused on learning experience and used a 5-point
286 scale were found to be highly reliable (10 items; α = 0.85) and significantly correlated,
287 r = 0.85 and p = 0.000. By using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) statistics, the
288 range of the average measure of the 10 items at the 95% confidence interval was
289 found to be 0.775 to 0.908. The detailed results of each question will be provided and
290 discussed later.
291
292 2.5 Data Analysis
293 The IBM SPSS Statistics programme, which is a software package for logical
294 batched and non-batched statistical analysis, was used to analyse the data.
295 In terms of the simple test on the knitting needles, an independent sample
296 t-test comparison was conducted to determine whether there were any differences
297 between Groups A and B regarding the scores for basic terminology or understanding
298 of the knitting action. The data analysis showed the influence of the learning methods
299 and determined whether there were any significant relationships between learning
300 performance and teaching approach. The results are very important for designing the
301 threading task since they can help assess whether AR videos lead to better learning
302 performance through either basic terminology or understanding of knitting action.
303 The threading task, which was designed on the basis of the results of the
304 simple test on knitting needles, was administered to the freshmen through either a
305 handout or an AR video. An independent sample t-test was used to determine the
306 difference in learning performance between the two groups of students. As the time
307 required by each student to complete the threading task was also collected, the
308 efficiency of the threading process based on understanding the task with the two
309 different types of learning tools was compared with data from Groups A and B.
310 Moreover, the responses to the questionnaire helped assess the effectiveness of the AR
311 videos and acquiring feedback from the users.
312
313 3 Results
314 3.1 Learning Outcomes of Simple Test on Knitting Needles 
MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
315 The results of the forty-two Year 3 students were analysed, with 21 in Group A
316 and 21 in Group B. According to Table 1, the total scores of the participants ranged
317 from 2 to 14 (M = 5.24, SD = 2.56). The scores were non-normally distributed, with a
318 skewness of 1.34 (SE = 0.37) and kurtosis of 2.24 (SE = 0.72). Regardless whether
319 the focus is the score of basic terminology or understanding of the knitting action, the
320 absolute value of the score is less than 1.96 or greater than -1.96. Moreover, p < 0.001
321 in the Shapiro-Wilk test shows strong evidence of non-normality.
322 Apart from analysing the total scores of the two groups, the scores for basic
323 terminology or understanding of knitting action were also separated in the data
324 analysis to easily assess learning performance with the use of the two learning tools.
325 The results are provided in Table 2.
326 In terms of basic terminology, a score of 5 was the maximum. The final score
327 ranged from 0 to 5 (M = 3.05, SD = 0.18). The results of this test did not follow a
328 normal distribution, with a skewness of -0.51 (SE = 0.37) and kurtosis of 0.08 (SE =
329 0.72). Therefore, a Mann-Whitney U test, which is a non-parametric test, was the
330 most appropriate statistical test, and it was used to analyse the outcomes regarding the
331 basic terminology between the two groups.
332 In Table 2, the Mann-Whitney U test indicates that the learning performance of
333 basic terminology of Groups A and B was similar, where U (42) = 195.5, Z = -0.65,
334 and p = 0.51, and the difference between the two groups was small (r = -0.1). There
335 was no significant difference between the two groups.
336 As for the understanding of knitting action, a score of 12 was the maximum.
337 However, no one received the maximum score. In line with Table 1, the scores ranged
338 from 0 to 9 (M = 2.19, SD = 0.35). As the results had a non-normal distribution, with
339 a skewness of 1.27 (SE = 0.37) and kurtosis of 1.27 (SE = 0.72), the Mann-Whitney
340 U test was also used for the data analysis.
341 As shown in Table 2, the Group B students (median = 3.00, mean rank = 27.57)
342 scored higher on understanding knitting action in comparison to the Group A students,
343 who learned the task from handouts (median = 1.00, mean rank = 15.43). Meanwhile,
344 the Mann-Whitney U value was found to be statistically significant, U= 93 (Z = -0.65),
345 p = 0.001, and the trend of the difference between the two groups was r = -0.50.
346
347 3.2 Learning Performance of Threading Task
348 The threading task determined the students’ ability to learn to thread an industrial
349 sewing machine. The data analysis results are shown in Tables 3 and 4.

350 For both the pre-test and post-tests, 16 was the maximum score. As shown in Table
351 3, the range of the scores on the pre-test and the time required (in seconds) was 1 to
352 13 (M = 4.91, SD = 2.64) and 70 to 591 (M = 264.30, SD = 107.52), respectively.
353 Neither followed a normal distribution since the skewness of the scores was 0.79 (SE
354 = 0.35) with a kurtosis of 0.78 (SE = 0.69), whereas the time required had a skewness
355 of 0.80 (SE = 0.35) and kurtosis of 1.24 (SE = 0.69). A Kruskal-Wallis test, which is a
356 non-parametric test, was therefore applied to carry out the data analysis.
357 Table 4 shows that there was no statistically significant difference between the two
358 groups in terms of their learning performance in the pre-test (H (1) = 0.13, p = 0.719),
359 with a mean rank of 22.91 (median = 4) for Group A and 24.34 (median = 5) for
360 Group B, which is an extremely small difference between the two groups (r = -0.053).
361 In addition, no significant time difference was found between them (H (1) = 1.10, p =
362 0.294), with a mean rank of 25.24 (median = 264 and 21.03 (median = 240) for
363 Groups A and B, respectively. In comparing the two groups, the difference between
364 them was also very small (r = -0.15).
365 The range of the scores in the post-test was 4 to 16 (M = 9.78, SD = 2.96), and the
366 time required ranged from 64 to 1002 seconds (M = 357.28, SD = 188.14) (Table 3).
367 Since the assumption of normality in distribution was not satisfied due to the
368 skewness and kurtosis values, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for the data analysis.
369 The scores of the post-test showed a statistically significant difference between the
370 two groups (H (1) = 20.96, p < 0.001), with a mean rank of 15.94 (median = 8) for
371 Group A and 34.24 (median = 12) for Group B, as shown in Table 4. A significant
372 difference was found between them (r = -0.67). A significant difference was also
373 found for the time required (H (1) = 23.98, p < 0.001), with a mean rank of 31.63
374 (median = 420) and 11.95 (median = 207) for Groups A and B, respectively. The
375 difference between the two groups was also significant (r = -0.722).

377 3.3 Questionnaire
378 A questionnaire was distributed to all students in both groups for the threading task.
379 All questionnaires were completed and returned.
380 All enrolled Year 1 freshmen (46 students) were in the 18-20 age range except for
381 one student in Group B who was between 21 to 23 years old. In total, only 2 students
382 in Group A were enrolled in the Fashion and Textile Design specialty, while the rest
383 had not yet chosen their major. Regardless of the group or specialty, the students had
384 not yet learned to thread an industrial sewing machine until they attended this sewing

385 workshop, although 4 students in Group B had previously attempted to do so out of
386 curiosity.
387 In terms of the question that asked students about the challenges they faced with
388 their learning tool for threading (Question 2), Table 5 shows that almost all Group A
389 students (96.3%) had difficulty understanding how to thread the sewing machine
390 based on the handout, whereas this was true for only about one quarter (26.3%) of the
391 students in Group B. Moreover, about one quarter, or 22.2%, of the Group A students
392 felt that learning from a handout was boring, but no one in Group B felt that way
393 about the videos, and about a quarter of them (26.3%) even felt that the threading task
394 was not difficult at all with the use of the AR videos.
395 In terms of the difficulty level of the threading task with the provided learning tool,
396 students were asked to rate on a 5-point Likert-scale, with 1 denoting not difficult and
397 5 very difficult. Compared to the students in Group B (M = 1.89, SD = 0.46), students
398 in Group A (M = 3.85, SD = 0.86) indicated that they experienced more difficulties in
399 learning the threading task, and the difference between the groups was significant: t
400 (41.41) = 9.95, and p <0.001.
401 Moreover, students were required to rate how much they agreed about the
402 advantages of using the learning tool for the six factors related to the threading task
403 on a 5-point scale, where 1 was strongly disagree and 5 was strongly agree.
404 Table 6 shows that there was a significant difference between the two groups for all
405 six factors related to learning (p < 0.05), including learning interest, engagement,
406 active learning, level of understanding, pace of learning, and academic outcomes. A
407 total score was computed by summing up all of the scores of the six factors, and it
408 was analysed for evaluation purposes. A significant difference was found between
409 Groups A (M = 18.89, SD = 4.54) and B (25.47, SD = 3.66), t (43.11) = -5.43, and p <
410 0.001.
411 Apart from collecting the ratings on the learning tools, two questions were asked to
412 determine the extent that the participants would like to have the respective learning
413 tool applied in their sewing class or even extended to other lessons. A Likert scale of 1
414 to 5 was used for both questions, in which 1 was strongly disagree and 5 was strongly
415 agree.
416 In terms of applying their respective learning tool in sewing class, Group B
417 students (M = 4.11, SD = 0.57) more strongly agreed that it was a good idea to use
418 AR videos in class as opposed to Group A students on the use of the handout (M =
419 2.52, SD = 0.75) (Table 6). There was a significant difference between the two groups, 
MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
420 t (43.75) = -8.15, and p < 0.001.
421 As for extending the respective learning tools to other classes, Group B students
422 demonstrated more support for doing so with the AR videos (M = 3.89, SD = 0.46) in
423 comparison to the students in Group A with the traditional handout (M = 2.56, SD =
424 0.80). A statistically significant difference between the two groups was obtained; see
425 Table 6, t (42.55) = -7.18, and p < 0.001.
426
427 4 Discussion
428 A simple test on three types of knitting needles was provided to Year 3 students
429 during a tutorial class. The test showed that the scores for basic terminology were
430 similar for the two groups of students, that is, those who were given a traditional
431 handout versus those who watched AR videos. Group B students received higher
432 marks for their understanding of the knitting action, and the difference was
433 statistically significant. This implies that teaching with the use of AR videos can not
434 only help students gain a conceptual understanding at the same level as traditional
435 handouts but also facilitate a better understanding of complex issues, such as 3D
436 processes, and spatially related learning and processing. Therefore, the threading task,
437 which is a processing task, was designed for freshmen students to further evaluate
438 their learning performance and the learning effectiveness and efficiency of AR videos
439 as a teaching tool.
440 As mentioned in Section 3.2, the pre-test result acquired for the threading task
441 showed that the ability of the two groups to thread a sewing machine was similar
442 since the scores and time required to do so were similar, without a significant
443 difference. This ensured that students learned from the same baseline and helped
444 obtain more accurate results for further evaluation. Regardless of the learning method,
445 the threading skills of the students improved after one of the learning tools was used.
446 There was a significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores.
447 In terms of the post-test scores, better threading performance was found in Group B,
448 with a significant difference between that group and Group A, which means that
449 learning with the use of AR videos resulted in better information processing skills and
450 thus increased understanding. Meanwhile, students exerted less effort in learning
451 because the time required to grasp the information was also less than that required
452 with the handout of Group A, and the difference was significant. These results were
453 consistent with the feedback collected in the sewing workshop. Group B students
454 indicated that it was not difficult to learn and understand the contents by watching 
MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
455 videos, but the students in Group A did not feel the same way about the handout. This
456 shows that the handout was less effective. According to the collected data, students in
457 Group A (using handout only) demonstrated less interest, lower engagement, less
458 active learning, poorer understanding, and more difficulties in controlling the pace of
459 learning, which resulted in lower academic outcomes. The results also implied that the
460 use of AR videos resulted in satisfaction with the learning experience and higher
461 learning efficiency, especially for process learning-related activities. These results
462 were also supported by a study carried out by Vergara, Rubio and Lorenzo (2017),
463 who found that the use of virtual learning tools in education has positive impacts on
464 students, including improvement in the level of understanding and increased
465 motivation to learn. Furthermore, Ullrich, Shen, Tong and Tan (2010) and Di Serio,
466 Ibáñez and Kloos (2013) indicated that students’ interest in learning and level of
467 engagement in learning activities improved as a result of using mobile device
468 technology.
469 Students in Group B also supported the use of AR videos for their sewing class and
470 other courses. In contrast, students in Group A did not feel the same way about the
471 handout. Although applying traditional videos could lead to partial benefits of AR
472 technology, the use of AR videos in current settings offers significant added benefits.
473 First, virtual object is overlaying into real world by using AR which provides
474 three-dimensional images showing a thorough and clear needle movement as well as
475 the threading process, which cannot be done via traditional videos. Threading is a
476 complicated task that students usually learn best in a 3D demonstration at the
477 laboratory. The AR technology provided students a 3D experience so that they could
478 “visualize” the real-world scenarios easily.
479 Second, the AR videos provided convenience to students as they could review the
480 multimedia information at home or anywhere else simply with their mobile
481 application and AR symbols. The use of AR videos provided considerable
482 convenience to students in the process of learning. Unlike the approach of using
483 traditional videos (or QR codes), where users can click each link (or scan each code)
484 individually, students using AR technology were only required to move their mobile
485 phone slightly to activate the next AR symbols once they completed their previous
486 learning task. The multimedia information was superimposed on the handout;
487 therefore, students could easily correlate the information in one goal.
488 In addition, the AR videos encouraged high levels of interactivity between students
489 and the learning materials. The current design of the mobile application allowed 
MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
490 students to select their learning process by choosing any sequence of the AR symbols
491 provided. Particularly in the textile industry, many manufacturing processes require
492 in-depth understanding of machine motion. Knitting is one typical example that
493 involves a series of dynamic processes (e.g., needles, yarn guide); students often have
494 difficulties in understanding the sequence of the process even in traditional videos.
495 Also, the multimedia resources triggered with AR technology interact with the motion
496 of users immediately. For instance, users can zoom in and out to see the graphics or
497 videos and these interaction cannot be operated in traditional videos. The design of
498 the AR app in the current study encouraged students to interact with their learning
499 materials and to take responsibility for their own learning. There is another
500 consideration in the pedagogical design of the current AR application. Currently, there
501 are two types of arrangements in playing the AR videos. When students move their
502 mobile devices away from the AR symbols, the AR videos (or other medium) either
503 continues to play or stops until the mobile app detects the AR symbol again. Each
504 arrangement has its own purpose in terms of pedagogical design. The former
505 arrangement encourages continuous learning, and it is particularly useful when the
506 task requires students to learn with non-stop instructions. Thus, the AR videos of
507 threading in the sewing machine were adopted in the current study. Students would be
508 better off in their learning without any interruption even if the application moves
509 outside the range where AR symbols cannot be detected. In other circumstances when
510 students are required to take control of their learning (e.g., pace of learning,
511 multi-tasking), pausing AR videos would be more suitable if they paused when
512 students moved their mobile device away from the AR symbols. Therefore, this
513 consideration should be taken into account when designing the AR application and
514 AR symbols. While AR videos offer many advantages, some of the Group B students
515 felt that there was room for improving the videos, such as adding subtitles and
516 reducing the speed of the video. In addition, the lower satisfaction with the learning
517 experience for the group of students who were using a handout may reflect the
518 handout design, such as its size, its clarity, and the layout of the graphics. Technical
519 problems, such as the stability of camera tracking, were also one limitation in the
520 application of AR technology (Wu, et al., 2013) and therefore should not be
521 neglected.
522
523 5 Conclusions
524 Overall, the use of AR videos, compared with the use of handouts in classes, 
MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
525 provides better learning results in terms of learning performance and efficiency and in
526 terms of providing a satisfying learning experience. These findings showed that AR
527 videos enhanced students’ learning experience and increased their understanding of
528 complex concepts in terms of spatially related learning and processing. Undoubtedly,
529 the research findings relied heavily on the design of the handouts and AR videos;
530 however, one important focus on this teaching innovation should rest on the impact of
531 student learning, the level of understanding, and learning motivation. Nevertheless,
532 the relatively small sample size in this study may be a concern, as fewer than 100
533 students took part in the two experiments. Future studies could consider a longer time
534 span or extend their focus across subjects. Other limitations of this study could be
535 overcome in future studies by adding subtitles, reducing the speed of the video, and
536 capturing the steps in detail in order to improve the learning experience. Although it
537 can be argued that normal videos may achieve similar outcomes, the use of AR videos
538 definitely provided convenience to students in learning; thus, the advantages of the
539 pedagogical design should not be neglected. The study focused on the evaluation of
540 an AR application in education and showcased the pedagogical design in the
541 discipline of textiles and clothing. The innovation of adopting an AR application in
542 this study had a positive impact on student learning and achievement, particularly for
543 learning a complicated task/concept, i.e., threading. As no similar studies have been
544 conducted in relation to instruction on knitting and sewing, it is hoped that this study
545 may open new avenues for research in similar disciplines to further improve the
546 quality of teaching and learning.
