Abstract
This study evaluated the effects of Group Triple P with Chinese parents on
parenting and child outcomes as well as outcomes relating to child academic
learning in Mainland China. Participants were 81 Chinese parents and their
children in Shanghai, who were randomly allocated to an intervention group
or wait-list control group. Parents in the intervention condition received
Group Triple P training, and parents and children were assessed at three/two
time points. Compared with the control group, parents in the intervention
group reported significant improvements in child adjustment problems,
parenting practices, parental adjustment, and parenting self-efficacy at postassessment. Moreover, there was a significant increase in parents’ satisfaction
with children’s academic achievement and a reduction in children’s academic
problem behaviors at post-intervention. All these effects were maintained at
6-month follow-up. There was also a significant increase in the child report
of positive parenting at post-intervention.

Introduction
Parenting programs based on social learning models have been developed to
help parents to promote their children’s development and to prevent and
address developmental, behavioral, and emotional problems (Sanders, 2012).
Numerous meta-analyses (e.g., Brestan & Eyberg, 1998; Coren, Barlow, &
Stewart-Brown, 2003; Sanders, Kirby, Tellegen, & Day, 2014) have shown
that parenting programs improve parenting practices and parenting competence, and reduce children’s behavioral and emotional problems. Such parenting programs are effective for a variety of populations, targeting different
child and parent concerns, and in a range of formats (see reviews, Pidano &
Allen, 2015; Sanders, Kirby, et al., 2014). Moreover, although most parenting programs were developed in Western cultures, research has demonstrated
that they are also acceptable and effective across a number of Asian regions
such as Japan (e.g., Goto, Yabe, Sasaki, & Yasumura, 2010; Matsumoto,
Sofronoff, & Sanders, 2010), Hong Kong (e.g., C. Leung, Sanders, Leung,
Mak, & Lau, 2003), and Indonesia (e.g., Sumargi, Sofronoff, & Morawska,
2015). A number of studies have also examined the effectiveness of Westerndeveloped parenting programs (e.g., Gu, 2005; Pan & Wu, 2008) in Mainland
China. However, these studies suffer several limitations, including small
sample sizes, no control group or lack of a randomized controlled research
design, and no measures assessing important outcome variables such as parenting practices and child behavioral problems. There is an urgent need to use
a more rigorous research design and employ more comprehensive outcome
measures to evaluate the effectiveness of Western parenting programs with
Chinese parents in Mainland China.
Confucian philosophy and values such as filial piety have greatly impacted
on Chinese parenting practices (Chao, 1994; Chau & Landreth, 1997).
Chinese parents have been depicted as emphasizing parental authority and
children’s obedience (Chao, 1994, 2000), and more “authoritarian” (K.
Leung, Lau, & Lam, 1998), “restrictive” (Chiu, 1987), “controlling,” and
“directive” in their parenting (Jose, Huntsinger, Huntsinger, & Liaw, 2000;
Lin & Fu, 1990) than European Western parents. However, Chao (1994)
argued that Chinese parents’ way of “training” children could explain why
they scored high on authoritarian parenting, and their parenting practices
were actually motivated by their “highly involved concern and care for children” (p. 1113). Furthermore, Chen, Dong, and Zhou (1997) contended that
Chinese parents were typically kindhearted and strict with their children,
which is similar to authoritative rather than authoritarian parenting style.
However, China has experienced drastic changes in economy, education,
family structure, and family lives (see Chang, Chen, & Ji, 2011) in the past
four decades, which are related to the well-known reform and opening policy

Guo et al. 3
since the late 1970s. These changes may have impacted on Chinese parenting
to some extent. For example, since the enforcement of the one-child policy,
Mainland Chinese parents have been found to overindulge their children to
some extent (Liu, Lin, & Chen, 2010). Moreover, a recent empirical study
also found that Mainland Chinese parents predominantly endorsed authoritative rather than authoritarian parenting, and they emphasized egalitarian and
two-way parent–child relationship and were warmth-oriented rather than
control-oriented toward their children (Lu & Chang, 2013). These findings
are rather different from the results of earlier studies (e.g., Jose et al., 2000;
K. Leung et al., 1998; Lin & Fu, 1990), which might reflect changes in
Chinese parenting in the past decades. Although these findings obtained from
urban areas may not generalize to other areas in China (Chang et al., 2011), it
does appear that Chinese parenting has become more authoritative and more
similar to Western parenting.
In this context, it is likely that Mainland Chinese parents, particularly
those in urban areas, will accept a Western-developed parenting program and
use parenting strategies or approaches learned from the program in their own
everyday lives. However, whether parenting programs developed in Western
countries can have the same effects in Mainland China is a question that still
needs to be empirically answered. This is particularly the case, as some
research has found that immigrant Chinese parents in Australia and America
tend to resist using some parenting strategies in Western parenting programs
(Crisante & Ng, 2003; Lau, Fung, & Yung, 2010).
In addition to the limited knowledge of the cultural acceptability of
Western parenting programs in Mainland China, there is a paucity of research
on the effectiveness of parenting programs on children’s academic outcomes,
despite the fact that parenting programs have been shown to be effective for
a range of child problems such as developmental disabilities (McIntyre,
2008; Plant & Sanders, 2007), autism spectrum disorders (Roberts &
Pickering, 2010; Whittingham, Sofronoff, Sheffield, & Sanders, 2009), and
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Jones, Daley, Hutchings,
Bywater, & Eames, 2007). Moreover, abundant literature has demonstrated
the relationship between parental factors such as parental goals and parenting
practices and children’s academic outcomes (see a review, Spera, 2005). For
example, authoritative parenting has consistently shown positive associations
with children’s academic success (Chen et al., 1997; Steinberg, Elmen, &
Mounts, 1989). As parenting programs aim to improve the way parents interact with children, theoretically it is likely they will have significant effects on
children’s academic outcomes. Currently, the majority of parent programs
(see Jeynes, 2012; Mattingly, Prislin, McKenzie, Rodriguez, & Kayzar, 2002)
that engage parents in children’s academic learning are parent involvement

programs that mainly work to promote parents’ involvement in children’s
education such as communication with schools and helping with children’s
homework. Although research has demonstrated the effectiveness of such
programs on children’s academic outcomes, overall, the positive effects are
generally limited (see a review, Jeynes, 2012). Moreover, these programs do
not pay much attention to improving the quality of parents’ involvement
(Pomerantz, Moorman, & Litwack, 2007), which might limit their effectiveness on children’s academic outcomes. Therefore, it makes sense to consider
other approaches to improve children’s academic outcomes.
In contrast to parent involvement programs that focus on increasing levels
of parents’ involvement in children’s education, parenting programs aim to
improve how parents interact with children across numerous aspects of children’s lives including their academic learning. Parenting programs can potentially improve the quality of parenting practices in relation to children’s
academic learning, and thus improve the quality of parents’ involvement and
promote children’s academic adjustment and well-being. However, little
research has examined whether parenting programs can have any positive
effects on children’s academic outcomes. For Chinese parents, research has
consistently found that they have high expectations for children’s academic
achievement (J. T. Y. Leung & Shek, 2011; Li, 2004), and several studies
have also shown the positive effects of their authoritative parenting and negative effects of their authoritarian parenting on children’s academic outcomes
such as academic motivation and achievement (e.g., Chen et al., 1997; Wang
& Chang, 2005). Parenting programs that promote authoritative parenting
have the potential to meet the particular needs and concerns of Chinese parents relating to children’s academic learning, in addition to addressing
broader parenting needs. However, to date, this question has not been
addressed empirically.
The Triple P–Positive Parenting Program is an example of evidence-based
parenting program that aims to enhance parents’ knowledge, skills, and competence to prevent children’s behavioral, emotional, and developmental problems (Sanders, 2012). Although the effectiveness of Triple P has been
demonstrated with Chinese parents in Hong Kong (e.g., C. Leung et al.,
2003), these studies have some limitations: First, Hong Kong as a Special
Administrative Region of China has a coexistence of multiple cultures and
has been more influenced by Western culture across many aspects, including
education, politics, and economy, thus it does not well represent Mainland
Chinese culture. Second, the studies to date have only used parent-report
measures as outcome indicators, which only captured parents’ views of intervention outcomes. However, children have different perceptions of parental
behaviors (Tein, Roosa, & Michaels, 1994) and their own behavioral and

emotional problems (Achenbach, McConaughy, & Howell, 1987; Phares,
Compas, & Howell, 1989) from their parents, thus it is also important to
evaluate the effects of parenting interventions from the child’s perspective.
Moreover, although a recent longitudinal study (Smith, 2015) has found that
Group Triple P can produce long-term positive effects on children’s reading
and numeracy skills, more research is needed to examine whether Triple P
has a positive influence on children’s academic lives such as increasing children’s learning motivation and reducing academic-related problem
behaviors.
To address these gaps, we aimed to test the effects of Group Triple P on
general parenting practices and child behaviors, as well as parenting in the
academic context and children’s academic outcomes in Mainland China. A
randomized controlled trial design was used, and Chinese parents recruited in
Shanghai were randomly allocated to an intervention group or wait-list control group. We hypothesized that compared with the wait-list control group,
parents receiving Group Triple P would report significantly greater positive
changes after the intervention, including (a) improvements in parenting practices, parental adjustment, family relationships, and parental teamwork; (b)
increase in parenting confidence and decrease in children’s adjustment problems; (c) improvements in parenting related to child academic learning,
reduction in children’s academic-related problem behaviors as well as positive changes in parental cognitions about children’s academic achievement;
(d) reduction in children’s learning stress and increase in children’s academic
self-regulation; and (e) parents would be satisfied with the program.
Method
Participants
Participants were 81 Chinese parents and their children from 81 families
residing in Shanghai. Families had to meet a number of eligibility criteria for
participation: (a) parents had a child who was in Grade 1, 2, or 3 in a primary
school; (b) child was not diagnosed with a disability (including intellectual
and learning disabilities); (c) parents currently lived with their child; (d) parent or child was not participating in programs or receiving services which
could potentially improve parenting practices or child behavior; and (e) parents were worried about children’s academic learning.1 A majority of parents
were mothers (86.4%) and only 11 parents were fathers, with mean age being
37.75 (SD = 3.32). Seventy-seven parents (95.1%) were married and three
parents were divorced or separated (one family did not answer this question).
Most parents (87.7%) had only one child. There were almost the same

number of boys (n = 40) and girls (n = 39; two families did not report their
child’s gender), and their mean age was 8.05 (SD = 1.12). More than half
(53.1%) of the children were in Grade 1, and there were more children in
Grade 2 (27.2%) than in Grade 3 (19.8%). More than half of parents (69.2%)
had a university degree or higher, and one fifth of parents had trade/technical
college qualifications. In all, 76.5% of parents worked full time, 8.7% worked
part time or at home, and 13.6% did not work. Only three parents reported
difficulties in meeting essential household expenses during the past 12
months. A majority of parents reported that they had enough money left over
to purchase most of the things they really wanted (63%) or some of the things
they really wanted (32.1%) after they paid for the essential household
expenses.2 Table 1 shows demographic characteristics of parents in the intervention and wait-list groups.
Measures
Parent measures. The Family Background Questionnaire (Sanders &
Morawska, 2010) was used to collect demographic information from parents,
including parent and child gender and age, parent marital status, family composition, parent education, work, and financial status.
The Parenting and Family Adjustment Scales (PAFAS, Sanders, Morawska,
Haslam, Filus, & Fletcher, 2014) assesses parenting practices and family
adjustment for parents of children aged 2 to 12 years old, and it has been validated in a Chinese sample (Guo, Morawska, & Filus, 2016). The measure
consists of two subscales: Parenting scale (15 items) and Family Adjustment
scale (11 items). The Parenting scale has four factors which include parental
consistency, coercive parenting, positive encouragement, and parent–child
relationship. The Family Adjustment scale has three factors, including parental adjustment, family relationships, and parental teamwork. Items are rated
on a 4-point scale from 0 (not true of me at all) to 3 (true of me very much).
The items are summed to provide total scores for the two subscales, with
higher scores indicating higher levels of parenting or family dysfunction. To
reflect the intervention effects on the different aspects of family adjustment,
we reported the results of the three factors of Family Adjustment separately.
In this study, the internal reliabilities were α = .74 for PAFAS Parenting and
.67, .79, and .61 for the three subscales of PAFAS Family Adjustment,
respectively.
The Child Adjustment and Parent Efficacy Scale (CAPES; Morawska,
Sanders, Haslam, Filus, & Fletcher, 2014) is a parent-report measure of child
adjustment problems and domain specific parent self-efficacy, which has
been validated in a Chinese context recently (Guo, Morawska, & Filus,

2015). The measure comprises two scales: CAPES Intensity (23 items) and
CAPES Self-Efficacy (18 items). The former scale assesses behavioral and
emotional adjustment in children aged 2 to 12 years old, consisting of three
subscales: Emotional Maladjustment scale, Problem Behaviors scale, and
Child Competencies scale. Items are rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0
(not true of my child at all) to 3 (true of my child very much/most of the time).
The Child Competencies items are reverse scored. Items are summed to yield
a total score, a problem behaviors score, a child competencies score, and an
emotional maladjustment score, with higher scores indicating more problems. The Self-Efficacy scale measures parents’ confidence in managing
children’s behavioral and emotional problems. Each item is rated on a
10-point scale, ranging from 1 (certain I can’t do it) to 10 (certain I can do
it). The 18 items are summed to obtain a total efficacy score, with higher
scores indicating higher levels of self-efficacy. The measure has obtained
satisfactory psychometric properties among Chinese parents (Guo et al.,
2015). In this study, the internal reliability was good for the three subscales
of CAPES Intensity and CAPES Self-Efficacy, α = .81, .78, and .77, and .92,
respectively.
Parenting in Child’s Academic Context Questionnaire (Guo & Morawska,
2014b) was an 18-item questionnaire adapted from the PAFAS Parenting
scale (Sanders, Morawska, et al., 2014) to assess parenting practices in children’s academic lives. The wording of items was carefully changed to
describe parenting practices related to children’s academic learning, while
the primary content was maintained. For example, the item “I give my child
a treat, reward, or fun activity for behaving well” was changed to “I give my
child a treat, reward, or fun activity for studying or doing their homework.”
Some items which are not suitable for adaptation were not included in this
questionnaire (e.g., “I enjoy giving my child hugs, kisses, and cuddles”), and
several items (e.g., “I help my child with their homework”) were added to
increase the comprehensiveness of the instrument. The internal reliability
was α = .62 in this study.
Academic Problem Behavior Questionnaire (Guo & Morawska, 2014a) is
an eight-item measure to assess children’s problem behaviors in the academic
context, which was developed based on our qualitative work (Guo &
Morawska, 2015) with Chinese parents. Some examples include “My child is
very slow at doing homework” and “My child goes to play before completing
homework.” Each item is rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 (not true of
my child at all) to 3 (true of my child very much/most of the time). Items are
summed to obtain an overall score to represent the level of children’s academic problem behaviors. Internal consistency was good in this study
(α = .86).

Parental Perception of Child’s Academic Achievement was assessed with
one item “Overall, how good do you think is your child’s academic achievement?” The item is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from A (very poor) to E
(very good). Parental Satisfaction With Child’s Academic Learning was
assessed with one item “To what extent are you satisfied with your child’s
academic learning?” The item is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from A (not
satisfied at all) to E (very satisfied).
Parent-Report Academic Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SRQ-A) was
adapted from a 32-item child-report measure (Ryan & Connell, 1989) to
assess children’s academic self-regulation from parents’ perspective. The
original measure assesses children’s academic self-regulation by asking why
they do homework, do classwork, answer questions in class, and try to do
well in school. It has demonstrated good reliability and validity in a Chinese
context (Guo, 2011; Tang, 2002). The measure has four subscales: Intrinsic
Motivation, Identified Regulation, Introjected Regulation, and External
Regulation. A Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) is calculated to represent children’s overall autonomy in their academic learning, with higher scores indicating higher academic autonomy. To reduce assessment burden for parents,
only 16 items were chosen for the adaptation, with eight items asking why
their child does his or her homework and eight asking why their child tries to
do well in school. Only the wording of the items was changed for parents. For
example, the question “why do I do my homework” was changed to “why
does your child do homework.” Items are rated on a 4-point scale, ranging
from 0 (not true at all) to 3 (very true). The internal reliability of the entire
questionnaire was α = .65 in this study.
The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (Turner, Markie-Dadds, & Sanders,
2002) is a 13-item questionnaire that assesses parents’ perceptions of the
quality of service, the extent to which the program met the parents’ needs, the
improvement in parenting and decrease in children’s behavioral problems,
and whether the participants would recommend the program to others. It has
been translated into Chinese and has previously been used with Chinese parents (C. Leung et al., 2003). This questionnaire was only administered to
parents at post-intervention. The internal reliability was excellent, α = .93 in
this study.
Child measures. The Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ; Scott, Briskman, & Dadds, 2011) is a brief 15-item child-report version of the Alabama
Parenting Questionnaire (Shelton, Frick, & Wootton, 1996), including five
subscales: Positive Parenting, Inconsistent Discipline, Poor Supervision,
Involvement, and Corporal Punishment. It has demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity (Scott et al., 2011) in an Australian sample, and a Chinese

version was available. Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0
(never) to 4 (always). The internal reliability estimates were .78, .51, .47, .33,
and .75 for the five subscales, respectively, in this study. Given the low internal consistency of inconsistent discipline, poor supervision, and involvement, these subscales were removed from data analysis.
The Learning Stress Questionnaire was used to assess learning stress in
primary schoolers with five items chosen and modified from the Educational
Stress Scale for Adolescents (ESSA; Sun, Hou, Xu, & Dunne, 2011), which
was developed in a Chinese cultural context. Some item examples are “I feel
there is very much homework to do” and “My parents care about my academic grades too much that brings me a lot of pressure.” Items are rated on a
5-point scale ranging from 0 (disagree very much) to 4 (agree very much).
The internal reliability was α = .65 in this study.
The SRQ-A is a 32-item child-report measure (Ryan & Connell, 1989) of
children’s academic self-regulation described in the Parent-Report SRQ-A.
To make the assessment comparable with the parent version in this study, the
same 16 items chosen for parents were used for children to respond to. The
internal consistency of the whole questionnaire was .73 in this study.
Procedures
Ethical clearance for this study was obtained from the Behavioral and Social
Sciences Ethical Review Committee of The University of Queensland. The
trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry
(ACTRN12613000660785). All participating parents provided written
informed consent. This study was mainly conducted in the counseling center
of East China Normal University and a community service center in Shanghai.
To recruit parents to participate in this study, advertisements were posted in
online parent forums, family education websites, and social networks, introducing the research and encouraging parents to participate. Moreover, a public notice was posted on the official website of the Counseling Center of East
China Normal University and their social networking media (i.e., Weibo). In
addition, leaflets were delivered to parents of children in a primary school,
which is located in the same district as the community service center.
After parents expressed interest in participation through registration, they
received a telephone screening interview to see if they were eligible. Eligible
parents were randomly assigned by an independent person who was not
involved in the study at any stage to one of the two groups: intervention group
or wait-list control group. Specifically, a unique number was assigned to each
parent with a sequence of consecutive numbers and then a random number
generator was used to randomly assign the sequence of numbers to two groups.

Following this, the first author was informed about the randomization results
and advised the parents of their group. Afterward, both groups of parents and
their participating children were asked to complete a set of questionnaires
before and upon the completion of the intervention. Intervention group parents
and their children were also asked to complete the questionnaires 6 months
after intervention. Given that children in Grade 1 and 2 might not have adequate literacy to read and understand the child questionnaires, they were
helped in person or via telephone (viz., the first author or a research assistant
read items one by one to children and explained to them with examples when
the child asked for help or reported he or she did not completely understand an
item). To avoid parents’ influence on children’s completion of questionnaires,
parents were asked to wait in another room while their children were completing the questionnaires. Parents in the wait-list control group received Group
Triple P after they completed post-assessment. If two parents from a family
attended the program, only the primary carer completed questionnaires.
Similarly, only one child of a participating family with two children eligible
for participation was asked to complete questionnaires.
Intervention Condition
Group Triple P is a group variant of Level 4 Triple P, which provides moderate to high intensity of intervention and focuses on improving parent–child
interaction and the application of parenting skills to a broad range of target
behaviors (Sanders, 2012). It consists of 4 × 2 hr group sessions for 4 weeks,
with a session each week, plus three telephone consultations which lasted 15
to 30 min each for another 3 weeks, with one consultation each week; the
eighth session was a group session to summarize program content and discuss how to proceed after the program. Before the first group session, a workbook summarizing the content of every sessions and suggested homework
was given to each parent. The group sessions included content presentation,
video watching, group discussions, and role-play exercises. Group Triple P
utilizes an active skills training process to teach parents a variety of parenting
skills. Parents are introduced to 17 positive parenting strategies including
ones to develop good relationship with children, encourage desirable behaviors, teach new skills and behaviors, and manage children’s misbehavior, as
well as planned activities routines for high risk situations to help parents to
generalize and maintain parenting skills across settings and over time. In telephone consultations, difficulties that parents encountered or issues that parents would like to discuss are discussed with an accredited Group Triple P
practitioner. Parents are also encouraged to do take-home exercises in every
session (Turner, Markie-Dadds, & Sanders, 2010).

12 Behavior Modification
In this study, all group sessions and telephone consultations were conducted by the first author, who was a PhD candidate in psychology and a
Group Triple P accredited practitioner. Some minor tailoring was done to
help parents to use strategies in their children’s academic lives. Examples
concerning children’s academic behaviors were given to parents in presentations; some exercises were demonstrated by the practitioner around children’s academic behaviors in group sessions; and parents were also
encouraged to practice Triple P strategies to deal with children’s learning
behaviors in group exercises and homework. No other adaptations were made
to the program because the existing literature does not support the advantage
of culturally adapted parent training interventions over unadapted typical
interventions for ethnic populations (Ortiz & Del Vecchio, 2013). Furthermore,
it has also been contended that before making adaptations for a particular
cultural population, “One should first implement the program as written,
except for minor changes in the songs, examples, and wording to match local
culture and context better” (Kumpfer, Pinyuchon, de Melo, & Whiteside,
2008, p. 231).
The program delivery closely followed the standard Facilitator’s Manual for
Group Triple P (Turner et al., 2010). To help the facilitator adhere to the content
of the program and as a part of the self-regulatory approach which underlies all
versions of Triple P, the practitioner was supervised by the second author who
is a clinical psychologist and experienced Triple P practitioner throughout the
program. The supervision included the practitioner’s report of the progress,
discussing how to address emerging difficulties as well as preparing for potential challenges for the next session. Moreover, the program checklists (see
Turner et al., 2010) for each session were completed by the facilitator and
adherence and non-adherence was determined by whether the essential elements were covered in each session. Adherence to all sessions was 100%.
For parents in the intervention group, six groups were conducted ranging
in size from three to 10 parents (M = 6.67) in each group. Parents participated
in an average of six sessions (M = 6.23, SD = 1.90) of the eight-session program, ranging from two to eight sessions.
Data Analysis
An intent-to-treat approach was used for data analysis. To deal with missing
values (both missing questionnaire item responses and attrition of participants), a multiple imputation (MI) approach is highly recommended compared with traditional methods such as case deletion and mean substitution
(Schafer & Graham, 2002). Therefore, MI was employed using SPSS v.20 for
missing data in this study and five data sets were created with the

substitutions of missing values. After that, statistical analyses were conducted
for each data set separately.
The short-term intervention effects were analyzed using two-way (condition by time) repeated measures (pre vs. post-intervention) MANOVAs for
conceptually related variables (i.e., parental cognitions about children’s academic learning and the two subscales of the Alabama Parenting scale), and a
series of two-way repeated measures ANOVAs for all other dependent variables. As only parents and children in the intervention group completed the
questionnaires at 6-month follow-up, one-way (time) repeated measures (pre
vs. post) MANOVAs were used for the conceptually related variables and a
series of one-way repeated measures ANOVAs were used for other dependent
variables to evaluate the long-term intervention effects. The approach developed by van Ginkel et al. (van Ginkel, 2014; van Ginkel & Kroonenberg,
2014) was used to pool the results of two-way repeated measures ANOVAs
and one-way repeated measures ANOVAs. However, given the current lack
of an approach to pool the results of MANOVA analysis, F and p value ranges
are reported in the results.
Results
Preliminary Analysis
There were 10.80% and 7.28% missing values in the entire parent data sets for
the intervention group and control group, respectively. Little’s MCAR tests
showed that the data sets were both missing completely at random, with χ2 =
897.02, df = 8,574, p > .999 for the intervention group and χ2 < .01, df = 2,567,
p > .999 for the control group. Similarly, there were 11.64% and 8.16% missing
values in the child data sets for the intervention and control groups of children.
Little’s Missing Compeltely at Random (MCAR) tests showed that χ2 = 534.32,
df = 1,369, p > .999 for the intervention group, and χ2 = 291.74, df = 515, p > .999
for the control group, indicating that the two data sets were missing completely at
random. A series of independent t tests revealed that there was no significant difference between the two groups on all outcomes at pre-intervention assessment
for parents and children, except for a significant difference in the RAI for children. Specifically, intervention group children at pre-test scored significantly
higher on the RAI than control group children, t(76) = 2.24, p = .028.
Attrition
As shown in Figure 1, one out of 81 parents (1.23%) and three out of 81 children (3.70%) did not complete the pre-intervention questionnaires. Out of the

81 families, seven parents (8.64%) and eight children (9.88%) did not complete post-intervention assessment; and six parents (15%) and eight children
(20%) in the intervention group did not complete assessment at 6-month
follow-up.

chi-square) showed non-significant difference in attrition rates between two
groups at pre-intervention assessment for parents, χ2(1, 81) = 1.04, p = .494,
or for children, χ2(1, 81) = .32, p > .999. Moreover, no significant difference
was also found in attrition rates at post-intervention for parents, χ2(1, 81) =
.13, p > .999, or for children, χ2(1, 81) < .01, p > .999.
Short-Term Intervention Effects
Table 2 summarizes the short-term intervention effects of Group Triple P on
all parent-report outcomes and child-report outcomes.
Parent-report outcomes. In terms of parent outcomes measured by PAFAS, the
repeated measures ANOVA results showed significant intervention effects on
parenting practices and parental adjustment. Specifically, intervention group
parents reported significant improvement in parenting practices, F(1, 73) =
17.76, p < .001, and parental adjustment problems, F(1, 76) = 7.24, p = .009,
than control group parents at post-intervention. However, there were nonsignificant group by time interaction effects on family relationships, F(1, 56)
= .02, p = .885, or parental teamwork, F(1, 49) = .28, p = .601, indicating no
significant intervention effects on these two outcomes.
Repeated measures ANOVAs also showed that parents in the intervention
group significantly increased their parenting confidence compared with control group parents at post-intervention, F(1, 76) = 5.16, p = .026, and their
children also had significantly lower levels of child adjustment problems
than control group children after the intervention, F(1, 60) = 7.26, p = .009.
Academic-related parent-report outcomes. In relation to academic-related outcomes, repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that the intervention group parents reported significant improvement in parenting practices in children’s
academic lives, F(1, 71) = 20.20, p < .001, as well as academic problem
behaviors, F(1, 75) = 11.03, p = .001, in their children at post-intervention.
The multivariate group by time effects on parental cognitions about children’s academic learning was also significant, F (2, 78) = 4.89-6.00, p = .004-
.010. The results of univariate ANOVA analyses showed that parents’
satisfaction with children’s academic achievement increased significantly for
the intervention group compared with parents in the control group at postintervention, F(1, 76) = 10.54, p = .002, but the intervention effect on parents’
perceptions of children’s academic learning was not significant, F(1, 56) =
2.27, p = .137. In addition, there was no significant intervention effect on
parent-report RAI, F(1, 75) = 0.86, p = .356.

Child-report outcomes. Regarding child-measure outcomes, there was a significant multivariate group by time interaction effect on parenting practices,
F(2, 78) = 3.67-5.54, p = .006-.030. Univariate ANOVA analyses indicated
that intervention group children reported their parents used more positive
parenting practices than children in the control group after the intervention,
F(1, 67) = 8.06, p = .006, but there was no significant difference in use of
corporal punishment between the two groups, F(1, 51) = .25, p = .616. The
ANOVA results also showed no significant intervention effect on children’s
learning stress, F(1, 46) = .25, p = .620). However, child-report RAI in intervention group children decreased significantly more than control group children at post-intervention, F(1, 65) = 5.77, p = .019.
Long-Term Effects
Parent-report outcomes. The analyses of long-term effects were restricted to
the intervention group only. The results are presented in Table 3. As shown
in the table, the repeated measures ANOVAs showed a significant time effect
for parenting practices, F(1, 35) = 11.83, p = .002, parental adjustment,
F(1, 35) = 22.55, p < .001, and family relationships, F(1, 36) = 7.85, p = .006,
for the intervention group at 6-month follow-up, indicating significant
improvement in these parent outcomes. However, no significant improvement was found in parental teamwork, F(1, 27) = 2.02, p = .167. Parents also
reported significantly higher parenting confidence, F(1, 36) = 28.21,
p < .001, and less child adjustment problems, F(1, 34) = 19.07, p < .001, at
6-month follow-up.
Academic-related parent-report outcomes. For academic-related outcomes, the
repeated measures ANOVA results showed significant improvement in parenting practices in the academic context, F(1, 36) = 39.13, p < .001, and
academic problem behaviors, F(1, 35) = 14.36, p < .001, in children at
6-month follow-up. Similarly, there was a significant multivariate effect on
parental cognitions about children’s academic learning, F(2, 38) = 9.01-
12.01, p < .001. Univariate ANOVA analyses showed that parents reported
significant increased satisfaction with children’s academic achievement,
F(1, 27) = 17.69, p < .001, but their change in the perceptions of children’s
academic learning was not significant, F(1, 25) = 1.81, p = .191. There was
no significant time effect for parent-report RAI, F(1, 32) = 0.22, p = .643.
Child-report outcomes. There were mixed long-term effects for child report of
parents’ use of parenting practices, F(2, 38) = 2.48-5.57 p = .097-.008. Univariate ANOVA analyses indicated significant time effects for positive parenting, F(1, 24) = 6.89, p = .015, but not for corporal punishment, F(1, 36) = .31,

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial of a Westerndeveloped parenting program in Mainland China. We evaluated the effects of
Group Triple P on general parent and child outcomes including parenting
practices and child adjustment problems, and parent outcomes related to
child academic learning as well as children’s academic outcomes.
In regard to general parent and child outcomes, we found that Group
Triple P significantly improved dysfunctional parenting and parental adjustment, increased parenting confidence and reduced child adjustment problems, and all the effects were maintained at 6-month follow-up. These results
are consistent with Triple P trials with parents in other Asian countries (C.
Leung et al., 2003; Matsumoto et al., 2010; Sumargi et al., 2015). Triple P
encourages nurturing, engaging, consistent, and assertive parenting (Sanders,
2012); hence, it coaches authoritative parenting. As recent research (Lu &
Chang, 2013) has shown that Mainland Chinese parents endorse authoritative
parenting and this is positively related to children’s social and school adjustment (Chen et al., 1997; Wang & Chang, 2005), it is not surprising that Group
Triple P had positive effects on a range of parent and child outcomes in this
study.
It is noteworthy that there was no significant effect on family relationships
until the 6-month follow-up, which may be due to a longer time that parents
need to significantly influence family member relationships. Moreover, parent’s participation in Group Triple P also significantly increased children’s
perceptions of positive parenting at post-intervention, meaning that parents
used significantly more positive parenting practices in children’s eyes.
However, this short-term effect was not maintained at 6-month follow-up
indicated by the mixed MANOVA significance levels, though the univariate
ANOVA result showed a significant intervention effect. As this is a rare
attempt to evaluate parenting changes in a parenting program from a child
perspective, more research is needed to explore children’s views on changes
in parenting practices following parents’ participation in a parenting program. The intervention effect on child report of corporal punishment was not

20 Behavior Modification
significant either at post-intervention or 6-month follow-up, which might be
caused by a floor effect due to the low average level of corporal punishment
reported by parents in this study.
Regarding academic-related outcomes, the results showed that Group
Triple P improved parenting in the academic context and reduced child academic problem behaviors, and the effects continued to be significant at
6-month follow-up. These findings suggest that Chinese parents applied
Triple P strategies they learned to children’s academic lives and thus made a
significant impact on children’s academic behaviors. Moreover, the parenting
intervention also significantly enhanced parents’ satisfaction with children’s
academic achievement, which might be because parents adjusted their expectations and became more accepting of their children’s academic achievement
or an actual change in their child’s academic achievement. Unfortunately, we
were not able to measure academic performance directly in this study,
although a recent 15-year follow-up study (Smith, 2015) in Western Australia
indicated Group Triple P when delivered to parents of children aged at 3 to 4
years produced sustained improvements in children’s literacy and numeracy
scores once at school (Smith, 2015).
Unexpectedly, the results indicated no significant effect of the intervention on parents’ reports of children’s academic self-regulation, but the intervention significantly reduced child report of academic autonomy at
post-intervention, though the effect was not maintained at 6-month followup. Children may have temporarily perceived the parenting changes as an
increased expectation for them to achieve more in academic learning so that
they became more externally regulated in the short term. However, Group
Triple P did not effectively promote children’s academic self-regulation in
this study as expected. As child academic self-regulation in primary schoolers is positively associated with positive parenting (Grolnick & Ryan, 1989;
Guo, 2011), and there was significant improvement in parenting practices for
this sample, the non-significant effect on academic self-regulation seems to
contradict this hypothesis. Similarly, the insignificant effects on children’s
learning stress also indicated that the parenting intervention did not reduce
learning stress in children as expected. Although some research (G. S. M.
Leung & He, 2010) has shown that parental support contributes to buffering
the negative influence of academic stress on academic achievement for primary schoolchildren, little research has illuminated the relationship between
parenting practices, parenting efficacy, and primary schoolers’ learning
stress. This means that it is unclear whether a parenting program can reduce
children’s learning stress through improving parenting practices and promoting parental confidence. Alternatively, it might be more difficult to make a
change to internalizing problems such as self-regulation and learning stress
Downloaded from bmo.sagepub.com at LAURENTIAN UNIV LIBRARY on April 21, 2016
Guo et al. 21
than externalizing problems, or the intensity of the parenting intervention is
not strong enough to make expected changes as only examples were tailored
in group sessions rather than including additional content focused on children’s academic learning.
There were some limitations to the study that should be considered. First,
parents were only recruited from a developed city, had received higher education, and had better financial status than the average levels in Mainland China.
Specifically taking education for instance, 69.2% of parents in this study had
a university or higher degree, whereas the gross rate of enrollment in higher
education was only 34.5% in 2013 and lower in the years before 2013 (Ministry
of Education of the People’s Education of China, 2014). This limits the generalizability of the findings to families in other areas of China or parents with
lower education or worse financial situation. As greater Triple P intervention
effects have been found to be related to lower family income for Chinese parents in Hong Kong (C. Leung, Sanders, Lp, & Lau, 2006), further research is
warranted to examine similar issues in Mainland China to inform public policies and family services. Second, several measures used in the study were
newly designed (e.g., Academic Problem Behavior Questionnaire) or adapted
from other existing measures (e.g., Parenting in Academic Context
Questionnaire), and they had not been previously validated. Although most of
the measures (except APQ) obtained adequate internal reliability, it is still
unknown whether they had satisfactory validity for Chinese parents or children. Moreover, even though we helped children in Grades 1 and 2 to complete the questionnaires, it is possible that the children did not fully understand
the items or how to respond properly, which may have influenced the validity
of the assessment, particularly considering that three subscales of the APQ for
children had low internal reliability. Therefore, the results of some outcomes
need to be treated with caution. Furthermore, even for validated measures
including PAFAS and CAPES, there is lack of normative values for Chinese
parents and children; thus, it was not possible to identify cases within or outside the clinical range and to compute reliable change indices. Finally, the
present design could not rule out the possibility that intervention effects may
be related to the increased attention provided to the participating parents in the
intervention arm compared with the wait-list control. However, we considered
it problematic and potentially unethical to use an attention placebo control
condition as a comparator. Such a condition can create additional difficulties
in retaining parents thereby creating a condition by attrition interaction.
Despite the aforementioned limitations, this study can offer unique contribution to understanding the effectiveness of a Western parenting program with
Chinese parents and especially its effects on parent outcomes related to child
academic learning as well as children’s academic outcomes.
