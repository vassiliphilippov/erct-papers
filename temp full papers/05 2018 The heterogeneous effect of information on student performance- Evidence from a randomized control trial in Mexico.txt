1. Introduction
There is a growing consensus that quality -rather than quantity-
of education is an important driver of economic growth (Hanushek
and Woessmann 2008, 2012). However, there is much less consensus
on what type of interventions can help improve student learning in
a cost eÔ¨Äective way. Based on the results of rigorous impact evalua-
tions,researchershaveidentifiedpedagogicalinterventions(e.g.adap-
tive computer basedassisted learningandstudent tracking), individu-
alized teacher training and teacher incentives based on performance1
astypesofinterventionsthataremostlikelytoimprovestudentlearn-
ing in developing countries (see Evans and Popova (2015), McEwan
(2015) for two recent reviews).2 Nevertheless, many low and middle
income countries do not have the resources to scale up interventions
of these types. In this paper we use data from a randomized control
trial in urban Mexico to study whether providing 10th grade students
withanessentiallyzero-costinformationpackageonmonetaryandnon-
monetaryrewardsofeducationcanaÔ¨Äecttheirperformanceinthelast
yearofhighschool(12thgrade),andinauniversityentryexam.
Evidence from developing countries shows that providing infor-
mation about the labor market returns to diÔ¨Äerent education levels
can improve students‚Äô attainment in basic education (Jensen, 2010).

Mexico, like many other middle-income countries, has reached
almost universal enrollment rates in primary and lower secondary
schools, but still faces important challenges in the education system.
Only six out of every ten students who enroll in high school grad-
uate on time. Among those who reached 12th grade in 2008, only
15.6 percent scored good or excellent in a census based nationally
standardized assessment of math skills - Evaluaci√≥n Nacional de Logro
Acad√©mico en Centros Escolares (ENLACE), as opposed to 52.3 percent
scoringgoodorexcellentinSpanish.PreviousresearchforMexicohas
highlighted that financial incentives have the potential to reduce the
achievement gap in high school.4 Nevertheless, it is unclear whether

In 2009 the Mexican Secretariat of Public Education (SEP for its
acronym in Spanish), attempting to improve on-time graduation and
learningoutcomesinhighschool,designedandpilotedanintervention

gender-specificinformationabouttheaverageearningsassociatedwith
completion of high school and university education, as well as about
theirlifeexpectancyandfundingopportunitiestheymighttaptoattend

an evaluation strategy based on a stratified randomized control trial
(RCT),with 26 schools assigned to the treatmentgroup and28 to the
controlgroup.InNovember2009, thebaselinedatawascollectedand

by a large share of public universities, we measure the impact of the

the average expected earnings associated with university completion
and life expectancy are higher than the observed values. Our results
show that, almost three years after the treatment was implemented,
both boys and girls in the treatment group are more likely to have
updated their beliefsabout the average earnings associated with high
school completion. The information package had no impact on the
proxy for completing high school on time, buthad a sizeableand sta-
tistically significant eÔ¨Äect on the ENLACE test score‚Äî0.22 standard

diÔ¨Äerences in time preferences (willingness to put oÔ¨Ä rewards in the

parents or teachers, or diÔ¨Äerential changes in aspirations. We do find
evidence consistent with the latter hypothesis since girls in the treat-
ment group are less likely to have ever been married and they report
higher education aspirations. We also find evidence of treatment het-
erogeneityalongotherdimensions: academicreadinessandhousehold
socioeconomic status. All students, irrespective of their initial condi-
tions, increase their level of eÔ¨Äort but only those who have relatively
strongacademicskillsandhighsocio-economicbackgroundsareableto

This paper provides two main contributions. First, although the
experimentwas notdesigned to separatelyidentify theeÔ¨Äect for boys
andgirls, thisis the first study to reportthe eÔ¨Äectsof an intervention
that provides gender specific information about the average benefits
associated with diÔ¨Äerent levels of education. In many disadvantaged

The EMS system is characterized by strict promotion criteria. Stu-

fail three or fewer subject areas can enroll in the next semester but
theyhavetoattendandpassintensivecourses(thesocalledregulariza-

torily completealltheir subject areasandmodules withinat most ten
semesters after enrolling in EMS. Otherwise they lose the right to re-
enroll. Partly as a result of the strict promotion rules, there are very
high grade repetition and subject repetition rates, 15.3 percent and
31.3 percent respectively in 2013.7 According to the 2009 Survey of

2.2. Descriptionoftheinterventionandevaluationdesign
The Percepciones pilot took place in 54 technological high schools
run by the Federal Government. The technological schools run by the
FederalGovernmentaretypicallylarge(930 studentsonaverage)and
they can belong to diÔ¨Äerent subsystems depending on their special-
ization: industrial (DGETI), agricultural (DGETA) and ocean-related
(DGCYTM).Thedesignoftheinterventionbenefitedsubstantiallyfrom
a survey conducted in 2005 as part of the evaluation of the Mexican
program J√≥venescon Oportunidades.The 2005 survey showed thatstu-
dents tended to misperceive the returns to education as compared to
theactualreturnsrevealedinthelaborsurveyENOE(EncuestaNacional
deOcupaci√≥nyEmpleo),andthemisperceptionswereparticularlyhigh
amonggirls.10
An interactive computer software, designed explicitly for the Per-
cepciones project, gathered information on students‚Äô perceived returns
toschoolingand,inthecaseofthetreatmentgroup,providedtheinfor-
mation package. In order to elicit the individual beliefs about their
own earnings upon completing subsequent school levels (lower sec-
ondary/highschool/university),thecomputersoftwareusedthreesub-
jectiveexpectationquestions,similartotheonesincludedintheJ√≥venes
con Oportunidades survey. Similarly, the computer software elicited
information about the students‚Äô perception about the earnings asso-
ciated with diÔ¨Äerent school levels for an average person, as opposed
to expectationsabout his or her own returns. The exact questions are
reportedinappendixA.1.
Students in the treatment group received three main categories of
information.First, they weregiven gender-specificinformation on the
monetarybenefitsofeducationalachievements,ascomputedusingdata
fromENOEforthesecondquarterof2009.Theinformationwasgiven
intheformof(a)levelofmonthlywagesinpesosforeacheducational

theadditionalincomeflowsassumingentryandexittothelabormarket
atages25and65,respectively.Theoriginalstatementsforhighschool
anduniversityarereportedinappendixA.2.

The second category of information described a higher education
scholarship program run by the federal government, known as Pron-
abes. This program targets student from households with a monthly
income equal to or below three minimum wages, and provides grants
that vary between $750 MX and $1000 MX per month for the entire
length of the higher education course. These amounts are relatively
large, since they vary in a range between 15 and 20 percent of the
average monthly salary that a graduate from a technological school
wouldearnuponenteringthelabormarket.Thescholarshipisuncondi-
tionalduringthefirsttwoyears,butdependsonacademicperformance
afterwards.
The third category of information concerned life expectancy dif-
ferentiated by gender. Based on the results of early theoretical
work (Becker, 1975; Ben-Porath, 1967) and more recent empiri-
cal evidence (Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney, 2009), longer life
expectancy should encourage human capital accumulation, since a

Most of the interventions that have been previously tested pro-
vide information either on the expected financial returns of edu-
cation (Jensen, 2010) or on the sources of financial aid (Dinkel-
man and Mart√≠nez, 2014).15 The Percepciones project gave stu-
dents an information package covering both types of informa-
tion, plus predictions concerning life expectancy. The interven-
tion‚Äôs design does not allow us to assess of whether our results
are driven by any specific piece of information or by the entire
package.
3. Conceptual framework and data

increase in eÔ¨Äort can lead to improvements in student outcomes. For
this purpose, we use a simple education production function, where
school performance S at time t is a function (f) of the student‚Äôs eÔ¨Äort
(e)andasetofpredeterminedcharacteristics(K0),thatinclude,among
others, student readiness, parental education, household income, and

High School Performance: Whenstartinghighschool,K0i isgiven
and it can not be altered by the intervention. A change in individ-
ual eÔ¨Äort is the only channel through which Percepciones can aÔ¨Äect
highschool on-time completionandlearningoutcomes.Iftheaverage
10thgradestudentisexpectingthathighschool graduationwillbring
earnings that are lower than the true ones, or her life expectancy to
be shorter than the true one, the provided information should cause
her to revise her beliefs upward. When promotion rules are not par-
ticularly strict and grade repetitions rates are low, an update in the
beliefs might not necessarily be associated with changes in student
eÔ¨Äort. However, as highlighted in section 2.1, promotion rules in the
Mexican high school education system are strict and repetition rates
are high. Therefore, the cost of not exerting the suÔ¨Écient amount of
eÔ¨Äort is particularly high. The extent to which e aÔ¨Äects S depends on
whether e and K0 are complements or substitutes in the production
function in eq. (1). If e and K0 are complements, only students with
a certain level of initial conditions will be able to translate increased
eÔ¨Äort into increased on time completion and better test scores. How-
ever, the eÔ¨Äect on the latter crucially depends on the selection eÔ¨Äect.

From 2007 to 2013, ENLACE was administered to all students in the
3rd to9th and12th grades.The testis voluntaryandhasno eÔ¨Äecton
graduation or a student‚Äôs GPA. The exam is administered in the stu-

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics for the full sample as
well as separately for boys and girls, distinguishing between students
in the treatment and control groups. In the top panel we report the
socioeconomic characteristics measured through the baseline survey,
and in the bottom panel the administrative information on 9th grade
test scores. Overall, the characteristics of the treatment and control
group seem well balanced in line with the randomized design of the
evaluation.Fatherstendtobemore educatedandmorelikelytowork

thediÔ¨Äerencesarenotstatisticallysignificantatconventionallevel(see
Table 1). Nevertheless, the combined take up rate of the 9th grade
exam is statically larger (p-value= 0.07) for the treatment than the
control group (78 percent versus 72 percent). In order to account for
the potential consequences of this imbalance, all our specifications
will include a dummy for whether the individual has the 9th grade
information missing. The average 9th grade scores in math and Span-

3.3. Outcomemeasures
3.3.1. ENLACE12thgrade
Students enrolled in 10th grade in 2009 were supposed to com-
plete high school in 2012.18 We use data from the 2012 12th grade
ENLACE exam to measure the three main outcomes of interest: the
probability of taking the test, math scores, and Spanish scores. The
12th grade test is given to students who are on track to graduate at
theendoftheacademicyear,andpreviouswork(Dustanetal.,2017)
hasfoundthatitisagoodproxyfortheprobabilityofcompletinghigh
schoolontime.Inoursample61percentofthestudentswhoweresur-
veyed at the baseline took the 12th grade ENLACE exam three years
later.Therearefour possible explanationsfor why a studentwho was
enrolled in EMS in 2009 did not take the 12th grade ENLACE exam
in2012: (1) thestudentdroppedout ofschool atsome point between
9th and 12th grade, (2) the student repeated one or more semesters,
(3) the student did not show up for the exam but regularly com-
pletedtheEMS,or(4)orpotentialmergingproblems.InappendixB.2
we discuss the extent to which each of these four explanations might
account for the attrition rate and we conclude that students dropping
out of school represents the most quantitatively relevant. Therefore,
we interpret the diÔ¨Äerence in probability of taking the 12th grade
exambetweenthetreatmentandcontrolgroupsasagood measureof
theintervention‚ÄôseÔ¨Äect on the probability of finishing high school on
time.
The ENLACE score has no bearing on graduation or university
admissions and the results do not aÔ¨Äect the funding received by the
schools.Therefore,asdiscussedinpreviouswork(Dustanetal.,2017;
Avitabileetal., 2015), there is littleincentivefor score manipulation.
Nevertheless,amongstudentswhoareenrolledinthesecondsemester
of 12th grade, the share of those who take the test is extremely high
(above90percentnationwide).Inordertoassesshowwelltheresults
in the ENLACE exam predict future outcomes, we merged the uni-
verse of 12th grade ENLACE data from 2008, 2009 and 2010 with
datafromtheEncuestade Insercionenel MercadoLaboralor ENILEMS,
a special module of the ENOE, which in 2010 collected information
on the academic and labor trajectories of the 18‚Äì20 year old high
school graduates. In Table 2 we find that both the scores in math
and Spanish display a positive and significant correlation with the
probability of being enrolled in university, and a negative correla-
tion with the probability of being a so-called ‚ÄúNot in Education, or
Employment‚Äù (NEE) and of being unemployed. Although it is a low-
stakes exam, the ENLACE scores are highly predictive of the future
academic performance and labor market outcomes of high school
graduates.
A random sample of 20 percent of the ENLACE takers are admin-
istered a survey, the so calledENLACE de contexto thatelicits a broad
setofinformationaboutstudentsociodemographiccharacteristics,such
as marital status, as well as student eÔ¨Äort and track specific trajecto-

3.3.2. EXANI-II
Individual level information on university enrollment is not col-

tionaboutEXANI-II,atestdevelopedbyCentroNacionalparalaEvalu-

schoolsfollowatwo-yearprogram.
3.4. Baselineperceptions
As discussed in section 2.2, a random subsample of 3502 (out of
4145) students took a computer-based survey that elicited both the
student‚Äôs own expected earnings and the student‚Äôs expected earnings
for the average person. Table AIV suggests that the characteristics of
students who took the survey in treatmentandcontrol schools are on

The diÔ¨Äerence betweenthe treatmentandthe control group is not
statisticallysignificantforanyoftheelicitedbeliefs.19 Atthebaseline,
the average expected monthly wage for oneself, with a high school

Forbothsexes,theaverageexpectedwageforoneselfis88percentof
thereal-worldaveragemonthlyearning.Girls‚ÄôcoeÔ¨Écientsofvariation
aresystematicallyhigherthanboys‚Äô.
In order to better understand how boys‚Äô and girls‚Äô beliefs vary,
we discretize the baseline answer applying the thresholds used in the
follow-up data source, i.e. the 12th grade ENLACE de contexto. Fig. 2
plots the distribution of expected earnings (for oneself) at the base-
lineagainsttheobserveddistributioninthe2009ENOEseparatelyfor
boys and girls. The largest diÔ¨Äerence between perceived and actual
earnings realizationsare concentratedin the first two bins of the dis-
tribution. In Fig. AII we plot the distribution of the expected earn-
ings for an average person between 30 and 40 and compare it with
ENOE.
Bothboys‚Äôandgirls‚Äôbeliefsaboutearningsassociatedwithauniver-
sitydegreeareonaveragehigherthanthoseobservedforauniversity
graduatebetween30and40yearsold,asmeasuredintheENOEdata.
This is true irrespective of whether considering the beliefsfor oneself
orfortheaverageperson.Thisresultisconsistentwiththefindingsin
Hastings et al. (2016) for Chile and Bonilla et al. (2017) for Colom-
bia,withcollegeapplicantssystematicallyoverestimatingtheearnings
outcomesforpastgraduates.
Interestingly, when we compute the implied perceived returns
for high school‚Äîas defined by the diÔ¨Äerence between the expected
monthlyearningsforahighschoolgraduateandtheexpectedmonthly
earningsforalowersecondarygraduate‚Äîwefindthatonaveragethey
are significantly higher than the actual returns. This suggests that on
averagestudentshavelittleknowledgeaboutthesalaryofalowersec-
ondary graduate, a sum with which that they could potentially have
direct experience, and they underestimate it. Whether students base
their decisions on the level of earnings or on the earnings‚Äô diÔ¨Äeren-
tial between two consecutive levels of education is a priori unclear
andpreviousworksthatexplicitlymodelstudentchoicehavefollowed
diÔ¨Äerent approaches.20 Whether students base their decisions on the
earnings or the returns would aÔ¨Äect the empirical predictions in our
case. If they base their decisions on earningsin levels, since expected
average earnings are lower than the true ones, we should observe an
increase in the level of eÔ¨Äort among students in the treatment group.
The opposite would happen if students base their decisions on the
expectedreturns.ThelasttworowsofTable3showthatbothboysand
girls tend to overestimate the expected life span, although the size of
the misperception is much larger for boys than girls. Unlike for most
of the perceived monetary benefits of education, we can not reject
the hypothesis that the expected life length is the same for boys and
girls.
In summary, we find that students on average underestimate the
labormarketearningsofhighschool graduates,buttheyoverestimate
those for people with university degrees. Our survey does not elicit
student beliefsabout the costs of attending university,21 and whether
students know about the existenceof financial support. It is therefore

20 Attanasio and Kaufmann (2014) models educational choices as a function
ofexpectedreturns.WiswallandZafar(2015)andDelavandeandZafar(2014)
are examples of studies where educational choices are aÔ¨Äected by expected
earnings.

decontexto,whichasksexamtakersabouttheirexpectedaverageearn-
ingsforhigh schoolcompletion.TwodiÔ¨Äerenttypesofcaveatsshould
betakenintoaccountwhencomparingtheexpectedearningscollected
at the baseline and at the follow-up. First, as already mentioned, the
ENLACEdecontextoonlycollectsinformationamong20percentofthe
entire population of exam takers. Given the large share of students
who dropped out before taking the 12th grade ENLACE, the popula-
tionsofexamtakersandnon-takersmightdiÔ¨Äeralongbothobservable
andunobservablecharacteristics.Thishasthepotentialtointroducea
selection bias. Due to the randomized assignment of the intervention,
the selection bias will not aÔ¨Äect the internal validity of our results as
long as it enters eq. (2) additively. Nevertheless, the external validity
mightbelimited.
Second, while the question regarding wage expectations included
in the 12th grade ENLACE de contexto reads exactly as the question
included in the baseline survey, the answer only allows the choice
between the six options described in section 3.4. In Fig. 3 we plot
the distributions of expected earnings in the treatment and the con-
trol group both for boys and girls in the follow-up. Compared to the
baseline, there is a higher proportion of boys and girls in the control
groupreportinganexpectedincomeinthebinwheretheobservedaver-
ageearningsfall.Nevertheless,whenwetestwhetherthebaselineand
follow-up distributionsfor boys and girlsin the control group are sta-
tistically diÔ¨Äerent, the Pearson ùúí2 test does not allow us to reject the
nullhypothesisthatthedistributionsofexpectationshavenotchanged
overtime.23
Weobserveareductionintheprobabilityofreportinganexpected
average monthly wage (for oneself) lower than $4000 MX among
boys and girls in the treatment group, compared to those in the
control group. Boys in the treatment and the control group do not
diÔ¨Äer in the probability of reporting an expected average earning
between $4000 and $7000 MX, but those in the treatment group
are more likely to report expected average earnings in all the bins
above $7000 MX. Girls in the treatment group have a larger proba-
bility of reporting an expectedaveragemonthly wage between$4000
and $7000 MX (where the average true value falls) than girls in
the control group. Girls in treatment and control schools do not dif-
fer in the probability of reporting expected average earnings above
$7000MX.
The graphical evidence is supported by the regression results pre-
sentedin Table 5. In the odd columns we present the averageeÔ¨Äects,
while in the even ones we present the gender diÔ¨Äerentiated ones. In
summary, both boysandgirlsseemtoupdatetheirbeliefsinresponse
to the information received as part of the intervention. However,
while girls adjust their perceptions in line with the statistics pro-
vided, a significant fraction of boys report values higher than infor-
mationprovidedbyENOE.Duetothediscretenatureofthedatainthe
follow-up,wecannottestwhethertheprogramaÔ¨Äectedtheperceived

23 Thep-valuesare0.286and0.597forboysandgirlsrespectively.However,
due to the limited number of observations, this result should be interpreted
cautiously.

income‚Äù.24 Belonging to a household with a monthly income higher
than $3500 MX is associated with an increase of 0.11ùúé in Spanish,
and 0.07ùúé in math. As discussed above, the level of proficiency in
lower secondary, as measured by the 9th grade ENLACE, is a strong
predictor of the probability of completing high school. Based on their
ENLACE results, students are classified in one of the following profi-
ciency levels: (a) insuÔ¨Écient, (b) regular, (c) good, and (d) excellent.
We define as suÔ¨Écient-readiness students those who score regular or
higher in the 9th grade ENLACE, and as low-readiness students those
whoscoreinsuÔ¨Écient.25 Forstudentswhoscoredatleastregularinthe
9thgrademathENLACEexam,the12thgradeENLACEmathandSpan-
ishscoresare0.50ùúé and0.41ùúé higherthanforthosewhodisplayedlow
readiness.
Sincewefoundnoimpact oftheinterventionon theprobabilityof
taking the ENLACE exam, it is unlikely that the eÔ¨Äect on test scores
is driven by diÔ¨Äerential selection into the ENLACE exam in treatment
andcontrolschools. Ifanything,anypositive eÔ¨Äecton theprobability
of taking the exam should lead to a downward biased estimate of the
treatmenteÔ¨Äecton thescores in math andSpanish.In fact,consistent
with the evidence presentedin Dustan et al. (2017), when we restrict
thesampletostudentsincontrolschoolswefindthattheprobabilityof
takingtheENLACEexamin2012 ispositively andstronglycorrelated
with student academic ability, as proxied by the 9th grade ENLACE
scores (see Table AV). Therefore, the marginal students - defined as
thosewho wouldhavenottakentheexamintheabsenceoftheinter-
vention - would be academically weaker than the average ones. We
checkwhether,asaresultoftheselection,theexamtakersinthetreat-

and most importantly, at a stage of academic life that is crucial for
futureentry into academia and labor markets. The reduced form esti-

We repeat a similar exercise using household income. Results in
Panel C in Table 7 show how the treatment eÔ¨Äects vary with the
dummies that proxy for diÔ¨Äerent levels of household income. Income
does not aÔ¨Äect the program‚Äôs eÔ¨Äect on the probability of taking
the 12th grade ENLACE exam. The treatment eÔ¨Äects on learning
outcomes among low income students are not statistically diÔ¨Äerent
from zero, although the size of the eÔ¨Äect is nontrivial for the math
score (0.20ùúé). Among relatively high income students the eÔ¨Äect is
positive and marginally significant on Spanish (0.18ùúé) and large for
math (0.32ùúé). When we consider the eÔ¨Äect on the average learning
score,wefinda0.12ùúé increaseamonglowincomestudents,asopposed
to a 0.25ùúé (statistically significant at 5 percent) among high-income
students, and a 0.17ùúé increase among students who did not report
income. We can reject the null hypothesis of no diÔ¨Äerential eÔ¨Äect
between low and high income students (p-value= 0.028), while
we can not reject it when we compare low income students with
those who do not report income information. There is no evidence
that the treatment heterogeneity is driven by imbalances in the
baseline characteristics across the three income groups of students
(TableAVIII).

intheprobabilityoftakingtheEXANI-IItestby3.9percentagepoints.
AlthoughtheeÔ¨Äectisstatisticallynotsignificant,thesizeisnottrivial
as it corresponds to about 0.10ùúé. Since the test is not a requirement
for students who enroll into private universities and a non-negligible
share of public universities, we expect our treatment eÔ¨Äect to be a
lower bound estimate of the true impact of Percepcioneson university
enrollment.Thediscussioninsection3.1canhelpusmakesenseofthe

In principle, we could expect that as the share of high school
graduates who take EXANI-II increases, academically weak students
are more likely to take the test. Nevertheless, when we look at the
impact of Percepciones on the probability of being classified as out-
standing in the exam, we find that the treatment eÔ¨Äect is positive,
although not statistically significant. We interpret this result as evi-
dence that Percepciones led to an average improvement in university
readiness.
Also for university outcomes, the results are unchanged when
we estimate OLS specifications, and we restrict the sample to
those who had access to the computer lab (columns 5 and 6
in Panels A and B in Table AX). Overall, although the treat-
ment eÔ¨Äects are not statistically significant, the results discussed in
this section support the conclusion that Percepciones improved out-
comes that are of particular relevance for individual labor market
outcomes.
5. Potential mechanisms
5.1. ImpactonstudenteÔ¨Äort
Inthesimpletheoreticalframeworkoutlinedinsection3.1,informa-
tionimprovesstudents‚Äôperformancethroughanincreaseinthelevelof
eÔ¨Äort.WhileobjectivemeasuresofeÔ¨Äortarenotavailable,weusethe
self-reported measure of eÔ¨Äort elicited in the 12th grade ENLACE de

amapersonwhoworkshardinschool‚Äùdescribesthemfully,whilefor
24 percent of the boys and 23 percent of the girls say the statement
describesthemalot.
The major concern when using self-reported measures in a con-
text like ours is the possibility of social desirability bias: students in
26 Thestudentswho underestimate theaverage earnings forupper secondary
and overestimate those for university represent 16 percent, with 5 percent of
thestudentsdoingthetheopposite.
the treatment group might be more likely to reply in a way that oth-
ers would view favorably. The measure of self-reportedeÔ¨Äort that we
use was collected almost three years after the intervention as part of
a standardnationallyadministeredsurvey, anditis thereforeunlikely
that students could bias their response as a result of the information
treatment.Previous work (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2004) has
found that self-reported measures of study eÔ¨Äort are aÔ¨Äected by sub-
stantial measurement error. In order to boost confidence in our mea-
sure, we use data from the control group to measure the correla-
tion between the self-reported level of eÔ¨Äort and the 2012 ENLACE
results in math and Spanish. One standard deviation increase in self-
reported eÔ¨Äort leads to a 0.11ùúé increase in math and 0.12ùúé in Span-
ish, and both correlations are statistically significant at conventional
levels.
We use eq. (2) to analyze the impact of the information treat-
ment on self-reported levels of eÔ¨Äort. In order to simplify the inter-
pretation of the results, we standardize the categorical variable using
the mean and the standard deviation observed in the control group.
Results are presented in Table 9. Column 1 shows the results for the
entire sample. Overall the treatment group reports a level of eÔ¨Äort
that is 0.24ùúé (statistically significant at 1 percent level) higher than
for the control group. In column 2, we consider the eÔ¨Äect by gen-
der and we find much larger impact for girls (0.35ùúé) than for boys
(0.11ùúé). We can marginally reject the null hypothesis of no diÔ¨Äer-
ential eÔ¨Äect by gender (p-value= 0.07). In columns 3 and 4 we
present how the eÔ¨Äect of Percepciones on self-reported eÔ¨Äort varies
with the levelof school readinessand household income respectively.
We do find evidence of increases in eÔ¨Äort for all the diÔ¨Äerent sub-
groups but neither for readiness nor for household income there is
evidence of treatmentheterogeneity.This resultis consistent with the
fact that we find little evidence that the beliefs of students with high
and low initial conditions responded diÔ¨Äerentially to the treatment
(TableAIX).
Insection3.4wediscussedhowinourcontextthepredictionsabout
theimpacton studenteÔ¨Äortwouldchangedependingonwhetherstu-
dents base their decisions on the expected earnings or on expected
returns. The positive impact on self-reported eÔ¨Äort documented in
this section is consistent with the former hypothesis. We also find
that the eÔ¨Äect is larger for those who reported baseline expected

at 5 percent) than for those who reported expected earnings above
(0.13ùúé), but we can not reject the null hypothesis of no diÔ¨Äerential
treatment.
Although the self-reported nature of the data requires a cautious
interpretation of the results presented in this section, the gender-
diÔ¨Äerentiated eÔ¨Äect on learning outcomes documented in section 4.3
can be potentially explained by the diÔ¨Äerential treatment eÔ¨Äect on
eÔ¨Äort.Theinformationinterventionseemstohaveimproved students‚Äô
intrinsic motivation, irrespective of their level of school preparedness
and household income. The fact that learning outcomes only increase
amonghigh-incomestudents,althoughbothhigh-andlow-incomestu-

sis of complementarity betweenstudent eÔ¨Äort and other inputs in the

The lack of eÔ¨Äect on self-reported measures of eÔ¨Äort might by
explainedbythepresenceofreferencebias,whichoccurswhenindivid-
ualresponsesareinfluencedbydiÔ¨Äeringimplicitstandardsofcompar-
ison. If this bias diÔ¨Äers for boys and girls, this can potentiallyexplain
why we only find an eÔ¨Äect on girls‚Äô eÔ¨Äort. We can not rule out this
explanation for the perception about being a hard worker (Table 9),
but this is much less likely to apply when studying the eÔ¨Äect on sub-
trackchoice(Table10).
Althoughonaveragebothboysandgirlsreportedbeliefsaboutthe
earnings associated with upper secondary completion lower than the
actualones, the extentof the misinformation might diÔ¨Äer. In order to
assess this possibility, we constructa continuousmeasure of misinfor-

observed value. The distribution both for boys and girls is plotted in

evidence that girls are more misinformed than boys, as this would in
principle lead to a larger impact in eÔ¨Äort for the former compared to
the latter. However, we can not rule out that boys are less likely to
increase eÔ¨Äort than girls because at the baseline they were over opti-
misticabouttheirlifeexpectancy.

erogenous responses. We investigate some of the potential sources of
response heterogeneity based on the insights from previous work on
gender diÔ¨Äerences. In the baseline survey we elicited information on
time preference using a framework similar to the one used by Rubal-
cava et al. (2009) and described in section 3.2. Consistent with their
results and other recent studies (Dittrich and Leipold, 2014; Bauer et
al., 2012), we find that women have lower time discount than men:
20 percent of boys, as opposed to 15 percent of girls, would prefer
accepting $3000 MX today, regardless of a higher amount oÔ¨Äered in
oneyear‚Äôstime.Wedefinetheseindividualsasthe‚Äúhightimediscount‚Äù

to forego the $3000 MX today in exchange for a larger sum in the
future.Lower timediscount should leadto anincreasedimpact ofthe
information package on student eÔ¨Äort. The data presented in column

in explaining the gender-diÔ¨Äerentiated eÔ¨Äect on learning is at most
small.

6. Conclusions
When entering high school, students face important decisions that
canhavelong-lastingconsequencesontheireducationandlabormarket
trajectories.Oftenthesedecisionsaretakenwithoutanadequatelevel
of information, especially in developing countries. This paper studies
whether a purely informational intervention can have medium-term
eÔ¨Äects on students‚Äô performance at the end of high school. We ana-
lyze the impact of an interventionthat targets 10th grade students in
Mexico and provides them information about the (1) earnings associ-
ated with high school and university education, (2) a program that
they might tap for financial aid for tertiary education, and (3) life
expectancy. The Percepciones pilot displayed no impact on the proba-
bilityofon-timehighschoolgraduation,buthadalargepositiveeÔ¨Äect

rates, at least in contexts where the eÔ¨Äort required to complete high
