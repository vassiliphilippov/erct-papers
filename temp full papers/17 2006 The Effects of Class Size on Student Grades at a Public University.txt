Abstract
We model how class size affects the grade higher education students earn and we test the model using an ordinal logit
with and without fixed effects on over 760,000 undergraduate observations from a northeastern public university. We find
that class size negatively affects grades for a variety of specifications and subsets of the data, as well as for the whole data
set from this school. The specifications tested hold constant for academic department, peer effects (relative ability in class),
student ability, level of student, level of course, gender, minority status, and other factors. Average grade point declines as
class size increases, precipitously up to class sizes of twenty, and more gradually but monotonically through larger class
sizes. The evidence is that this is not exclusively a small class effect. We conclude that there are diseconomies of scale
associated with a deterioration of student outcomes as class sizes grow larger. The cost of this deterioration is not
quantifiable with our data, as much of the costs are non-market costs and unobservable. Future studies of economies of
scale in higher education need to address the traditional assumption of constant product quality.

1. Introduction
This present paper makes a contribution to
understanding a major problem of resource allocation in the faculty staffing of classes in higher
education. It has been observed that if faculty can
teach larger class sizes with no adverse outcomes,
then economies of scale may not always be utilized.
If student outcomes are adversely affected by larger
classes, then perhaps institutions are incurring
diseconomies of scale (see Hancock, 1996).1
If they exist, economies of scale are a particularly
attractive way to reduce costs at schools experiencing increasing demands for education and where

Hancock noted that if the performance outcomes of students
in different sized classes was indeed not class size dependent, and
if the y learning experience is not demonstrably harmed by
significant increases in enrollment caps, then it is certainly
harmed by not increasing them. While Hancock admits that
outcomes may be a function of size in some disciplines beyond
statistics courses (the data Hancock used), he is properly
concerned about expending resources in staffing unnecessary
sections throughout higher education.
the quality of the incoming students appears to be
rising or steady.2 Schools often look to spreading the
costs of a faculty over more students by increasing
class sizes or by increasing workload (number of
courses taught per term). This latter method is
resisted by faculty senates, unions, and often
trustees, leaving the easier option of marginally
increasing class size as a way to realize economies of
scale. The pressure to achieve class size economies of
scale is discussed in Nelson and Hevert (1992), Toth
and Montagna (2002) and Moore (2003).
But the questions arises, is the education received
in a large class the same as that in a small class? To
bring further light on this question, we estimate the
influence of class size on student achievement in
higher education. We model grades as an output
and test this model using a very large dataset from a
medium-sized public research university.
Applying a logistic regression with and without a
fixed effects model we find that class size is an
important negative variable in predicting grades and
that the functional form of the relationship is
consistent with the theoretical model developed by
Glass, Cahen, Smith, and Filby (1982) to explain the
negative effect of class size on K-12 student
performance. We explore several specifications,
additional models, various proxies for a key
variable (student ability), and how the effect of
class size on grades differs for advance placement,
at-risk, underrepresented and female undergraduates. We also test the results by academic department. In all cases we find class size negatively affects
student grades. We conclude that any considerations of economies of scale must consider the scale
effects on the quality of output. Schools that seek
to reduce costs by increasing class sizes may need to
take steps to train faculty or otherwise rectify
poorer student outcomes and other diseconomies
of scale.
2. Background
2.1. K-12 studies
By the 1970s there was near consensus in the
educational research community that class size had
little effect on student achievement.3 However,
Glass and Smith, in a series of articles beginning
in the late 1970s (Glass, McGaw, & Smith, 1981;
Glass & Smith, 1979; Smith & Glass, 1980)
presented a theoretical model suggesting that the
functional form of the relationship between class
size and student achievement should be negatively
sloped and concave.4 This model has become a basis
for further normative discussion on whether, or
how, class sizes should vary.5 Glass & Smith also
presented the results of their own meta-analysis of
studies looking at the effect of class size sustaining
the negative logarithmic relationship between class
size and student performance.6 Given this apparently beneficial evidence of smaller class sizes,
several states designed experiments to replicate
Glass et al. (1982) findings.7 In 2003, a number of

Thus, we find concerns about graduation rates and the
average time-to-degree performance of universities [NYS Executive Budget (2005–06),] the increasing use of part-time and nontenure track faculty (Ehrenberg, 2004) and increasing tuition fees
and corporate sponsorship (Rizzo, 2004).

Student/pupil ratios in K-12 schools had been dropping since the
1950s without any marked increased in standardized test scores or
other indicators of overall student performance, and the majority of
the studies conducted at the classroom level showed either no or
very modest affect of class size on student performance. The U.S.
Department of Education reports that K-12 student teacher ratios
fell from 26.9 in 1955 to 17.2 in 1998. Yet average class sizes remain
at about 24. The increase in special education teachers is believed to
be the principle reason for this apparent contradiction. 4
The negative slope suggests that the ideal class size from the
point of view of the student’s learning is size one. The concavity
suggests an optimal tradeoff might exist between the student and
the school (society). If concave, the rate of fall off in student
outcome decreases slowly at first, and then more rapidly. If the
costs of providing student outcomes are typical, it may also
decline per student as the numbers of students per class increase,
but rapidly at first as the costs of facilities and faculty are
distributed over more students, and less rapidly at larger number
of students as marginal efficiencies diminish. Hence, there may be
a societal optimum, assuming society bears the costs of education
and receives its benefits, where the rate of diminution in outcomes
equals the rate of diminution in per student costs. 5
Lipman (1990), Kennedy and Siegfried (1996, 1997). 6
Heavily weighting studies that they considered more experimental in design, and discounted those they considered non- or
quasi-experimental, Glass et al. (1982) argued that the positive
effect of smaller class sizes results from attitudinal changes in
both teachers and students in that environment. 7
The most extensive experiment was Tennessee’s STAR project
(Ritter & Boruch, 1999; Word et al., 1990). The results of the
STAR Project showed that students scored better on 3rd grade
standardized tests in math and reading if they had attended
smaller sized kindergartens (Finn & Achilles, 1990, 1999;
Krueger, 1999). Follow up studies showed that those students
who continued in small classes beyond kindergarten did better
than those that did not (Nye, Hedges, & Konstanopoulos, 1999)
and that small classes seem to be most beneficial to those coming
from disadvantaged backgrounds (Krueger & Whitmore, 2001;
Slavin, 1990). Subsequently, the findings from the STAR
program and more modest experiments elsewhere (Tillitski,
222 E.C. Kokkelenberg et al. / Economics of Education Review 27 (2008) 221–233
articles appeared in a special editions of The
Economic Journal (V113, February) concentrating
on U.S. and U.K. experiences and summarizing a
vast amount of literature. The papers therein
concentrate on data from K-12 to examine this
question (see Dustman, 2003).
Even though there is now strong evidence that
smaller class sizes improve student performance, at
least in some circumstances, and using common
methodologies to test the data, the debate continues. In particular, economists point out the need
to weigh the costs of achieving smaller classes versus
the costs of improving student achievement by other
means (Nelson & Hevert, 1992; Maxwell & Lopus,
1995; Hanushek, 2003).8 Further methodological
challenges have weakened these claims (Maasoumi,
Millimet, & Rangaprasad, 2003; Krueger, 2003).
2.2. Higher education
Though there is debate about the extent of
benefits small classes bring, or how much it costs
to achieve, there is at least some agreement in the
K-12 literature that using certain tests, class size
matters in some circumstances. No such agreement
exists in the literature concerning the effect of class
size in higher education. Indeed, in two wellrespected reviews of the literature (Williams, Cook,
Quinn, & Jensen, 1985; Pascarella & Terenzini,
1991) the authors conclude that the overall evidence
suggests that class size plays no or little influence on
student achievement. This however has not quelled
the debate. McKeachie (1980), and McKeachie,
Iran-Nejad, and Berliner (1990) have presented
arguments that class size is the primary environmental variable college faculty must contend with
when developing effective teaching strategies. They
argue that while class size may not be significant in
courses best suited for lecture style learning, courses
geared toward promoting critical thinking and
advanced problem solving are best taught in a
smaller classroom environment.
McKeachie’s view is consistent with findings that
suggest that students’ (and professors’) motivation
and attitude toward learning tends to be more
negatively affected by larger classes (Bolander,
1973; Feldman, 1984; McConnell & Sosin, 1984;
Spahn, 1999). Though they may have learned the
material, students do not feel as satisfied with the
classroom experience as they would have in smaller
classes, suggesting that some learning opportunities
may have been lost.
A summary of more recent research is given in
Toth and Montagna (2002) and Kwantlen University (2004). Toth and Montagna summarize eight
studies from 1990 to 1999 which find, mixed results
for three studies; positive increases in outcomes
where class sizes are reduced for two studies;
outcomes to be better in large classes for one study;
and no significant results for two studies. Kwantlen
summarizes other recent research showing variously
no relationship between class size and achievement;
negative relationship (larger classes yield less
student achievement); larger classes enhance student
outcome; large classes are as effective as smaller
classes; and that student characteristics and instructional design are important factors. Kwantlen
quotes an Ohio State website Research Results,
Mixed and concludes that for courses that emphasize recall of facts, large classes are equally effective
as small classes; for courses emphasizing problemsolving, critical thinking, long-term retention, and
attitude toward the discipliney small classes are
more successful. (Kwantlen, 2004, p. 3).
These studies generally focus on one discipline
(e.g. Communications), and often one level of
course work (e.g. Introductory Economics). Sample

1990; Molnar et al., 1999; Weiss, 1990) heavily influenced
California’s decision to spend 6 billion dollars on class size
reduction (Santa Barbara, 2001). 8
The evidence suggests that average class sizes must be reduced
to 15 to achieve significant improvement in test scores, yet it has
been estimated that this would cost up to eleven billion dollars a
year if enacted nationwide at the K-12 level (Brewer, Krop, Gill,
& Reichardt, 1999). In view of current total spending on K-12
education nationwide of $655 billion in 1998 and over $790
billion in 2002 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2005), this seems modest.
While the STAR project does show significant improvement in
students attending smaller sized kindergarten, the estimated
beneficial effect of continuing in small classes is modest and its
significance debatable (Harder, 1990; Slavin, 1990). Further, the
implementation of the STAR experiment has been in question.
The attempts to randomly assign students to different sized
classrooms may not have been perfect, given that some parents
may have tried to get their child into the treatment group of
smaller classes. For similar reasons, the morale of teachers and
students in control groups might have been different than those
assigned to the treatment groups (Hanushek, 1995, 1996, 1999a,
1999b). Indeed, in a recent sophisticated statistical analysis,
Hoxby (2000) critiques numerous class size studies on the basis of
how they assigned students to different size classrooms. Using an
exogenous assignment model she found only sketchy evidence
that class size positively influences performance. See also

sizes are often small (comparing students from two
classes, 25 and 50 students), arbitrarily grouping
students into three categories (small classes of 30 or
less, medium of 31 to 90, and large of over 90
students). The dependent variables are many, tests for
persistence, scores on a post class test specific to a
discipline, grades, or grade distribution of the class.
Also, there is some further evidence that class size
may matter in some courses or disciplines, but not
in others. Raimondo, Esposito, and Gershenberg
(1990) found that students in smaller sized introductory macroeconomic courses did better in
subsequent intermediate macroeconomic courses
even though the same was not true when conducting
the analysis for microeconomic courses. They
suggest, consistent with McKeachie’s argument,
that smaller classroom environments enhance the
more wide-ranging, non-formula based knowledge
necessary for understanding macroeconomic principles. There is also an argument for small classes in
the performing arts where skills and techniques are
individually taught.9
There is also a debate about how to measure
student outcomes at the university level. In the K-12
studies, pre and post testing is ubiquitous, the
change in student performance, relative to the
improvement found in students not subjected to
whatever the variation in teaching method or
classroom that is under study, is attributed to the
changed element. Investigators have both a control
group, and a tested, agreed upon metric. We lack
control groups and an agreed upon metric in most
studies focusing on higher education. Hence, the
increased student performance in higher education
can be measured by a variety of metrics, grade in the
class under study or a subsequent course, performance on a graduate admissions exam, graduation
or retention rates, percentage going on to graduate
or professional work, self reported satisfaction with
a course, or even salary or wealth at some time
postgraduation. There are numerous problems
associated with measurement of many of these and
as one moves further away through time from the
course under study many extraneous factors cloud
the conclusion. Finally, much of the K-12 testing is
done for specific academic subjects, such as chemistry or reading comprehension. We are not aware
of a comparable single set of before and after test
scores that is applicable across academic subjects in
higher education.
We address many of the above deficiencies in this
paper and present findings, based on a very large
dataset from a single institution covering 24
semesters and 45 disciplines, of how class size
(measured continuously) affects student outcomes,
as measured by grades, after controlling for other
relevant student and course characteristics. We
motivate the discussion using the economic theory
of wages as a way to think about the nature of
grades from a student’s perspective.
3. The model
Labor theory (Mincer, 1974) suggests that earnings or wages depend upon ability, education, and
experience. Applying this to higher education, we
postulate the following story. Students attend
institutions of higher education to gain experience
and education. They pay for this education through
tuition, fees, living expenses, living conditions, and
foregone wages. At the end of some period of study
they are rewarded with some sort of certification,
which in turn may result in earning higher lifetime
incomes and increased non-monetary utility. During
this time they are paid by a form of scrip, that is,
credit hours and individual grades, which when
amassed, indicate the extent and quality of their
performance in school. When accumulated sufficiently, the script can be used to buy a certificate or
degree. The quality of the script, and indeed its
acceptability in buying a degree, is represented by
the course grade. Since there often are grade point
standards, course grades have an additional screening importance.
We can consider a course grade then, as a form of
reward or payment denoting the quality of the script
for the performance the student achieved in a
specific course. We define W as the wage, and
hypothesize that a student’s wage (grade) can be
explained by her ability and experience, controlling
for individual-specific and environmental characteristics. We thus write for the ith student in the jth
class during period t,
Wijt ¼ b0 þ fðEitÞ

b þ yðAitÞ

G þ Z0
itg þ V0
itk. (1)
Here, W represents the grade, E the ith student’s
experience (e.g. level in college), A represents ability,

Using another perspective, Lesser and Ferrand (1998)
reviewed student opinion and eliminated class size as a factor
affecting the student’s perception of instruction, attributing
observed variations to majors, faculty ability and student
preparation. McKeachie (1999) gives further references on class
size research differentiating among learning methods, types of
material and student motivation.
224 E.C. Kokkelenberg et al. / Economics of Education Review 27 (2008) 221–233
Z a vector of student related variables, and V is a
vector of environmental, faculty, and subject matter
factors including class size (CS). fðEÞ and yðAÞ are
allowed to be polynomials in E and A, and b; G; l,
and k are vectors of parameters to be estimated
while b0 denotes a vector of constants, also to be
estimated.
The null hypothesis is that class size does not affect
student learning or performance and this would be
reflected in the stability of grade distributions over
various class sizes for various subjects, while holding
the other independent variables constant.
4. Data
This study was conducted using data from a
highly selective research institution (new Carnegie
classification) located in a small city in the Northeast. There is one observation per student per course
for each semester analyzed totaling 998,898 observations. The data consists of all undergraduate
students for the period Fall 1992 through Spring
2004. Students take courses in five schools; Arts and
Sciences, Education and Human Development,
Engineering, Nursing, and Management. The dependent variable is the grade a student receives in a
course. Only grades that count toward a student’s
GPA are considered; thus incompletes and withdrawals are dropped from the analysis reducing the
number of observations. This results in a censored
sample and any assumption that those dropped
have the same distributions of characteristics as
those retained cannot be made. The resulting bias in
our results however would be to support the null
hypothesis as students that withdraw most often do
so as they expect low grades. Further reductions
incurred when certain variables were censored. The
resulting basic overall dataset contains over 764,000
observations. The variables and data are discussed
further in Appendix A.
5. Results10
We begin by presenting the results of a model of
grades (W) as explained by relative ability ðArÞ, the
class mean grade that takes peer effects in account,
ðW¯ CÞ, the departmental mean grade ðW¯ DÞ, class size
(CS), initial objective ability (SATM, SATV), the
presence of advanced placement courses in high
school (AP), experience on campus as a student
(entered as a freshman ðFÞ, and student level ðLÞ),
gender ðGÞ, minority ðMÞ, and time ðYÞ. The model

The results of estimating an ordered logistic of Eq.
(2) are shown in Table 1.
The first numeric column is for the full dataset
whereas the next two columns show the results for
two sub samples of the data. The first of these,
labeled IQ1, is for the 342,289 observations lying
within the interquartile range of class sizes; the
second, IQ2, uses the 271,941 observations lying
within the interquartile range of grades.11 This
model, using these three subsets of data explains the
observed data well. SAS reports a series of measures
of association between probabilities predicted by
the model and those observed in the data (analogous to an adjusted R-squared.) Among these are
the G, the tau-a and the c statistics. The G statistic, a
ratio of the likelihoods calculated from the model
with only intercepts and that calculated from the
model with the independent variables, is distributed
chi square with 15 degrees of freedom. The critical
value at PR ¼ 0:005 is 32.801, and our G values
exceed this (see Table 1). The c statistic’s theoretical
range is from 0.0 to 1.0 (0.5 or lower indicates that
ARTICLE IN PRESS
10The model represented by Eq. (1) was estimated via the
logistic procedure in SAS, version 9.0. Initially, the model was
developed using one-fifth of the data. A full specification of
Eq. (1) including a large number of proxies for several variables
and polynomials in experience, ability and class size, was
estimated. We also tested a number of demographic variables
such as race, EOP, talent level, registration as a degree seeker,
(footnote continued)
and county of residence. Other variables explored included
faculty rank, a variable for majors(s), whether the course was a
laboratory course, and whether the course had a discussion
section and used teaching assistants. The model was then
simplified using statistical tests for the significance of explanatory
variables and tests for multicollinearity. A simplified model with
a limited number of observations—limited by deleting the top
and bottom class sizes—was next tested on a second subset of the
data. After this, variants of the model given by Eq. (1) were
estimated using the full dataset of 672,489 observations, and
various sub-datasets as explained. 11Inter quartile ranges eliminate the more extreme class sizes
and grades. Observations at the upper and lower ranges of
independent variables can have a large impact on non-intercept
coefficients serving as leverage points. For modest sized data sets,
tests of the influence of an observation can be run. The use of
inter quartile ranges can serve as a test for very large data sets.

the model’s predictions are no better than chance).
Our regression results are 0.765, 0.773, and 0.731
(see Table 1) indicating a high discriminatory power
of the model. The Tau-a is a test of the null
hypothesis that we have an improperly specified
model. Calculated Tau-a values of under 0.05
indicate failure to reject the null hypothesis. The
calculated values are 0.450, 0.465, and 0.389. In
summary, the model explains the observed data very
well indeed.
Turning next to the individual parameters from
the logistics regression we find that all independent
variables (with one exception for the time variable),
including class size, have a statistically significant
influence on grades, as all the p-values are less than
0.0001. Note that Table 1 reports standard errors.
Experience and ability are positively related to
grade. Minority students do less well than nonminorities, females and those with high SAT scores
do better but females do worse in larger classes
(CS  G is negative). The departmental mean grade
has the largest single impact on grades. This
indicates that further work in this area should
account for departmental grading culture, traditions, and the material presented in class, as
McKeachie (1999) suggests.
The chief result of interest in this paper is that
class size enters all estimations with a negative value
(0:007; 0:012; 0:008 for each of the three
datasets (see Table 1)). Note also the positive
estimates of the squared term, CS2
, are consistent
with the concave model suggested by Glass et al.
(1982). Therefore, the null hypothesis that class size
does not matter can be rejected. We also found this
result to be robust as to variations in other proxies
for experience, ability, department, faculty and for
other classroom environmental variables. Further,
the standard errors on the class size terms are small
(0:00022; 0:000102, and 0.000038, respectively).
The coefficients at plus or minus two standard
errors for class size thus range from 0:00201 to
0:00193; 0:00496 to 0:00456, and 0:00231 to
0:00215; all negative and narrow ranges.
One could argue that the results are determined
by the differing social structures in small versus
large classes and that faculty are reluctant to give
poor grades in small classes but more willing to
award low grades to more anonymous students in

large classes. To test if this is what drives our results,
we re-estimated our model for other subsets of the
data (the mid 90% and 80% ranges of class size, as
well as for successively larger minimum class size
cut-offs, and again for successively smaller maximum class size cut-offs). These results (Table 2)
show the parameters on CS are consistently
statistically significantly negative, ceterus paribus.12
Another possible explanation of our results is
prompted by the work of Bressoux, Kramarz, and
Prost (2005) who found that poor students benefited
from small classes whereas good students did not. A
set of regressions was run to test this. The data was
partitioned by cumulative grade point average at the
start of the relevant term into two groups; the first
consisted of 146,150 observation where students’
GPA was in the upper 40% and the second
consisting of 276,327 observations where students’
GPA was in the lower 40% of the GPA distribution.
The model was that of Eq. (2). The coefficients on
class size and the square of class size from the
ensuing logistics regressions were comparable to
those in column one of Table 1. The class size
coefficients were 0:0068 and 0:0074 for upper
GPA and lower GPA students, respectively. Hence,
while poorer students seem more adversely affected
by large classes, both groups suffer from increased
class sizes ceterus paribus, and students appear not
to select into courses based upon their GPA and the
anonymity available in large classes.
The analysis, using an abbreviated model, was
next extended to 10 diverse departments, Economics, Psychology, Political Science, Chemistry, Computer Science, English, History, Management,
Mathematics, and Music. These results also indicate
class size has a negative impact in seven and a nonsignificant effect in the other three departments (see
Table 3). Note further, the significant coefficients on
class size are approximately one magnitude apart at
most across departments, ranging from 0:0003 to
0:007 (Mathematics to Music). Note also, while
women do better overall (see Tables 1 and 3), they
do worse in Economics and Chemistry.
We also estimated Eq. (2) for several introductory
courses in Mathematics and Economics that had
sections of widely varying sizes over the time period
observed. The class size coefficient estimated is
always statistically significantly negative. These
results are available from the authors upon request.
In summary, all of these results sustain the view that
the effect of class size on grades is negative over a wide
range of class sizes, courses, and departments, holding
other demographic and student variables constant.
Next we show the results of analyzing a subset of
data graphically. Figs. 1 and 2 show cumulative
probabilities for specific grades by class size. The
first deals with all classes, the second with classes
sized six students or greater. Again, the message is
that students in large classes have a higher probability of lower grades than those in smaller classes,
ceterus paribus. Note that the probabilities fall
rapidly for classes up to about 20 to 40 students and
much more gradually thereafter. Thus, if grades are
important, there is less of a decline in the
probability of high grades when moving from
classes of size 60 to 80 than for increasing class
sizes from 10 to 20.

6. The fixed effects model
If one treats the data as a panel data set, where
the individual student is the unit of observation then
a fixed effects model can be given as
Witj ¼ b0 þ bi þ bt þ b1Eit þ b2Ait þ b3CSj þ b4W¯ Dj.
(3)
Here bi is the student fixed effect and bt the semester
fixed effect. These two variables allow us to control
for individual attributes not explicitly contained in
the experience (level) and relative ability variables
(which may evolve over time), and time fixed effects,
which control for grade inflation, if present.
Initially, we estimate the model using the proportional odds assumption for ordinal logistic regression. That is, the marginal effects between an A
minus and a B plus is assumed to be the same as the
marginal effects between any other grade pair, say B
minus and C plus.
We estimate a polynomial variant of Eq. (3) in
both fixed effects and no fixed effects sub-variations.
These are Models 1 and 2 of Table 4. In the first
Model, the data was for 167,928 students and in the
full data set. The data was differenced by subtracting the average grade the student received from the
individual grade; hence, a fixed effects model.
Model 2 in Table 4 is for the same data but
estimated without fixed effects for comparison. The
chief result is that class size again is strongly
negative with coefficient values that are one order
of magnitude larger than ability or experience. A
test of the proportional odds assumption however
fails with a p-value of less 0.0001.
Next, we relaxed the assumption of proportional
odds and we estimated a binary fix effects model of
Eq. (3) for a random sample of 10,000 students
chosen from the 167,928 observations.13 The results
are reported in Table 5.
Again, the model includes an experience variable,
an ability variable to allow for time varying student
ability, a departmental variable, and a class size
variable. All fixed student characteristics are differenced out against the individual student’s mean
value. The binary logit estimates the probability at
each grade level (for example, the probability of
getting a B plus or better versus the probability of
getting a B or lower). Note that the three runs
bifurcating the probabilities at F versus D or better,

D or lower versus C minus or better, and C minus
or lower versus C or better did not converge and are
thus not reported. We believe that this has to do
with the smaller number of observations in this
subset at those grade levels. Note that again, the log
of class size has a negative coefficient that the
departmental mean grade has the largest impact on
grades, and that better students improve with
experience. Both of these results of fixed effects
models are consistent with and confirm the results
from the ordinal logit estimation reported above in
Tables 1–3.
7. Discussion
This study of grades in higher education, using
various models relating environment, ability, and
experience to undergraduate course grades, shows
that class size has a negative relationship to grades
and that while the value of the class size coefficient
differs across different departments and subsets of
data, it is negative in all cases.
Though we have found a negative relationship
between grades and class size, we cannot conclude,
to the extent that grades are but a proxy for
knowledge, that students learn more in smaller
classes, 10 nor do we offer a reason for our result. As
Glass et al. (1982) argued attitudinal changes
among faculty and students might account for the
observed results. Recall that McKeachie (1999)
suggests that optimal teaching methods and class
sizes vary by subject matter and level. He also
reminds us that students may self select class
sizes whenever possible. Alternatively, as the K-12
literature suggests, the attention faculty can give to
individual students and the intensity of engagement
in learning that occurs in small classes could
account for the results. We do observe however,
that the negative relationship persists even when we
account for variations in data subsets, models,
included variables, and statistical methodology, a
robust result.
We conclude that there are diseconomies of scale
associated with a deterioration of student outcomes

as class sizes grow larger. The cost of this
deterioration is not quantifiable with our data, as
much of the costs are non-market costs and
unobservable. For example these costs may include
lost revenue due to a decrease in student persistence
and a resulting lower student retention rate as well
as the loss of reputation caused by lower graduation
rates. Nor have we quantified the added cost of
training and properly staffing large classes to negate
adverse grade effects. We do conclude that any
institutional benefits from larger classes must be set
against the short and long-term costs associated
with the resulting poorer student performance. The
evidence presented in this paper suggests class size
influences the likelihood of getting good grades and
that future studies of economies of scale in higher
education need to consider the effect class size has
on student outcomes.
