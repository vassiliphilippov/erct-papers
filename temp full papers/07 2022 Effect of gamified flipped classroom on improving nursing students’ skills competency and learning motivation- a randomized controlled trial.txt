Abstract
Background: Flipped learning excessively boosts the conceptual understanding of students through the reversed
arrangement of pre-learning and in classroom learning events and challenges students to independently achieve
learning objectives. Using a gamification method in flipped classrooms can help students stay motivated and achieve
their goals.
Methods: This study adopted a randomized controlled study design with a pre-test and post-test and involved 128
nursing students at Mansoura University. This study randomly divided the students into the study and control groups.
Data were collected at three time points using six tools. In the intervention group, Moodle was gamified for 6 weeks.
Results: A significant difference in the students’ self-confidence (p
=
0.021), skills knowledge (p < 0.001), intensity of
preparation (p < 0.001), and motivation (p < 0.001) was observed between the two groups; however, no difference
in the students’ skills performance (p
=
0.163) was observed between the two groups after using gamified flipped
classrooms.
Conclusions: Compared with the traditional flipped classrooms, gamified flipped classrooms improved nursing
students’ motivation, intensity of preparation, skills knowledge, and self-confidence during laboratory clinical practice.
Thus, gamification is a learning approach that can be implemented in conjunction with the flipped classroom model
to motivate students to participate in the learning process.

Introduction
One of a nurse’s essential competences is the capacity
to deliver care to patients based on nursing skills and
knowledge [1]. Having satisfactory knowledge and per-
formance of proper nursing skills improves students’
self-confidence while delivering care [2]. Nursing instruc-
tors have a crucial role in teaching students to masterly
perform psychomotor skills [3, 4]. The flipped classroom

(FC) strategy, is a highly learner-oriented pedagogical
method [5] that allows educators to provide online mate-
rials for students to watch memorize and present inde-
pendently before coming to classes so that the class time
can be better spent on learning activities, like skills prac-
tice and discussions [6].
Many studies have confirmed that the FC strategy has a
higher efficiency than traditional classrooms in enhanc-
ing nursing students’ skills, knowledge, attitude, having
satisfactory study, self-learning, problem solving, and
critical thinking [7–12]. Other studies emphasized that
flipped learning improved nursing students’ confidence
in their ability to apply knowledge and skills in clinical
practice [13–16]. However, other studies reported no
significant differences in learning outcomes between the
flipped and traditional classroom groups [17–19]. Many
even felt that the FC strategy was less effective because
more time was spent preparing outside class [20, 21].
To create a successful FC, students’ intrinsic motiva-
tion and compliance with the FC requirements are cru-
cial components in achieving the preferred learning
outcomes [10, 22, 23]. However, according to a literature
review of studies on the FC strategy, the most faced dif-
ficulty is decreasing students’ motivation, which pre-
vents the predicted increase in academic achievement
[24, 25]. Moreover, a study by Heitz et al. [26] reported
that 31% of students in the FC group were non-com-
pliant. A survey regarding FC use before clinical skills
laboratory teaching reported that the absence of stu-
dent involvement with the FC strategy is one of the main
challenges faced by educators [27]. According to a sys-
tematic review, the greatest obstacles for the instructors
to overcome are how to engage and motivate students in
watching the recorded lectures [28]. Moreover, another
systematic review reported that the FC strategy may be
perfectly applied to active learners, as opposed to passive
learners, in terms of students’ learning satisfaction and
skill performance [29]. Finally, a pre-class quiz fails to
enforce students to watch pre-class videos regularly [30].
This suggests that to boost student participation during
FC practice and prepare them for class, novel methods,
such as gamification, are greatly needed [31].
The proper application of gamification strategies in stu-
dent education is expected to serve as a tool for solving
motivation and learning performance problems. First,
the self-determination theory, which has been effec-
tively applied to the setting of gamification, provides an
explanation for the motivational appeal of various game
design elements. Gamification uses game fundamentals,
such as scores, leaderboards, and badges, toward non-
game activities to increase student interest and motiva-
tion through competition [32–34]. Second, based on
gamified learning theory; gamification can affect learning
Page 2 of 13
outcomes indirectly by improving already beneficial
instructional content and influencing behaviors and atti-
tudes [35].
The combination of FCs and gamification has been
widely used in various studies, which have reported
that this combination had a positive impact on student
achievement. Sailer and Sailer [36] have shown that gam-
ification of class activities improves social relatedness and
motivation. Zhao et al. [37] have found a positive relation
between gamification of electronic books and students’
FC performance, meta-cognition tendency, and motiva-
tion. Forndran and Zacharias [38] indicated that the stu-
dents’ self-confidence had been positively impacted by
gamified flipped learning. A systematic review on the use
of gamified learning among university-level medical and
nursing students reported that it positively influences
student satisfaction and motivation [39].
Although FC learning is becoming increasingly popu-
lar, there are certain disadvantages that gamification
can significantly address [40]. However, there are still
very few studies on the gamification of FC in nursing
education, and most have examined its effect on cogni-
tive gains and psychological needs[31, 41, 42], and few
have examined its effect on clinical learning outcomes
of nursing students [43]. Axley [44] defined the princi-
ple of nursing competency from a wide angle. Essential
attributes include motivation, attitude, critical thinking,
maturity, openness, and self-evaluation, in addition to
the sheer accomplishment of abilities. So, in this RCT
study, we propose that gamification of FC (using game
quiz, badges, leaderboards, levels, rank, and points)
could motivate, increase preparedness before labora-
tory classes, and improve Fundamentals of Nursing stu-
dents’ skills competency (knowledge, performance, and
confidence).
Aim of the study
This study was designed to assess the effects of using
gamified FCs on the Fundamentals of Nursing students’
skills competency and learning motivation.
Research hypothesis
(1) Nursing students learning in a gamified FC will have
higher learning motivation scores than those learning in
an FC only. (2) Nursing students learning in a gamified
FC will be more prepared for fundamental skills labora-
tory than those learning in an FC only. (3) Nursing stu-
dents learning in a gamified FC will have higher scores
for fundamental skills knowledge than those learning in
an FC only. (4) Nursing students learning in a gamified
FC will have higher scores for fundamental skills per-
formance than those learning in an FC only. (5) Nurs-
ing students learning in a gamified FC will have more

confidence performing fundamental skills than those
learning in an FC only.
Conceptual framework
In the present study we based our hypothesis on two
theories:
I- According to Self-determination theory, people
have three basic psychological needs that can moti-
vate them to decide whether or not to engage in a
particular activity: autonomy, relatedness, and com-
petence [45]. Gamified activities that give individu-
als the autonomy to select the tasks they want to
complete (e.g., by providing varying levels of diffi-
cult tasks; game quiz) can address this need.Partici-
pants’ emotional and behavioral engagement can rise
when they feel they have some degree of autonomy
[46]. The need for people to interact or connect with
one another is referred to as relatedness [45]. This
demand is met by gamified activities that let partici-
pants compete or work together (Leaderboard and
rank). An increased sense of relatedness aids in fos-
tering feelings of enjoyment and can motivate indi-
viduals to continue taking part in the activity [46].
Competence is defined as the need to master one’s
pursuits or learning. The use of immediate feedback
(such as points or badges) and indicators of partici-
pants’ advancement (levels) can help boost individu-
als’ sense of competency [34].
II- The gamified learning theory [35] provides a gen-
eral framework that conceptualizes the relationship
between gamification and learning. There are four
elements to this theory: (1) instructional content
(flipped videos), (2) behaviors and attitudes (intensity
of preparation), (3) game characteristics (gamified
quiz, badges, leaderboard, levels unlock, points) and
(4) learning outcomes (skill competency). First, the
theory suggests that, learners’ behaviors and learn-
ing outcomes are directly influenced by the instruc-
tional content. Gamification is described as a method
to enhance instruction rather than replacing it [35].
Second, the theory proposes that behaviors and atti-
tudes affect learning outcomes. Third, game charac-
teristics are expected to directly influence behaviors
and attitudes [47].
Methods
Study design
A randomized controlled design with a pre-test and post-
test and a control group was used in this study.
Subjects
Participants were recruited from the Faculty of Nurs-
ing, Mansoura University. The students of the Funda-
mentals of Nursing II course (2020/2021) who were
willing to participate were involved. This study required
an a priori sample size of 128 students, who were ran-
domly divided into two groups (study and control)
using block randomization with a block size of 4. The
sample size was determined using G*Power (version
3.1.9.7). Two-tailed t-test and two groups, with an
effect size of 0.5, alpha of 0.05, and power of 80%, were
previously identified. The effect size of 0.5 was obtained
from a meta-analysis study which estimated a medium
effect size in favor of gamification over learning without
gamification [48]. Another study comparing motivation
levels reported means of (20.72 and 19.72) among study
and control groups respectively, with SD within each
group equal to 2.95; using g power, it gives an effect size
of 0.5 also [49]. Eligible students were selected using
the inclusion criteria that included nursing students of
both sexes who registered in the Fundamentals of Nurs-
ing II course in the second semester (2020–2021), who
have access to the Internet at home, and who agreed to
participate in the study. Those previously registered in
the Fundamentals of Nursing II course were excluded.
All randomization procedures were performed by
an independent statistician and were blinded to the
authors until intervention procedures.
Tools
The primary outcomes were improvement in nursing
students’ motivation, skill knowledge, skill performance
and skill confidence level. The secondary outcome
includes improvement in nursing students’ intensity of
preparation. Six tools were used in this study.
Tool I: Questionnaire of demographic characteristics
This tool was used to obtain data regarding age, sex,
economic status, grade point average, high school type,
high school location, decision to join nursing, and level
of interest in nursing. An 11-point scale (0
=
lowest,
10
=
highest) was used for student self-rating of eco-
nomic status, degree of interest in the course, inter-
est in the nursing profession, and class participation
(Table 1).
Tool II: Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS)
The IMMS was developed by Keller [50]. This tool has
four domains: relevance, attention, satisfaction, and
confidence. The total number of questions was 36,
which were answered using a five-point Likert scale
(1, do not agree; 2, agree; 3, moderately agree; 4, agree;

questionnaire range from 36 to 180, with greater scores
reflecting a greater level of motivation of learning.
Tool III: Confidence Scale (C‑Scale)
The C-Scale was adopted from Grundy [51] and was used
to estimate students’ confidence level relevant to skill
performance. This tool consists of five items answered
using a five-point Likert scale, and its total score ranges
from 5 (low confidence) to 25 (high confidence).
Tool IV: Intensity of Preparation (IOP)
The IOP was adapted from Sailer and Sailer [36] and was
used to assess preparation intensity using three items
that cover the number of times students viewed the
skills video, whether the users used the video lecture’s
slides, and whether they took notes while watching the
video lecture. The number of times the video lecture was
viewed was counted by the students who responded to an
open inquiry with their viewing history. The slides and
note-related questions were scored as two dichotomous
items, with the “yes” response receiving a value of 1 and
the “no” response receiving a value of 0. To evaluate the
variable preparation intensities, a pooled score was cal-
culated for the aforementioned items.
Tool V: Fundamentals of nursing II knowledge tests
Three formative quizzes for each timepoint were devel-
oped by the researchers. Each consisted of 20 ques-
tions: quiz 1 covered oral medication administration and
intramuscular injection; quiz 2 covered range of motion
exercises and subcutaneous and intradermal injections.
However, quiz 3 covered glucocheck and heat and cold
applications. The scoring system was implemented by
adding five points to every right answer and 0 points
to every incorrect answer. Then, the total score was
calculated.
Tool VI: Fundamentals of nursing II skill observation
checklists
Eight checklists were developed after reviewing the lit-
erature, nursing textbooks, and logbook of the Faculty
of Nursing, Mansoura University, which are as follows:
checklist 1 (oral medication administration); checklist
Elzeky et al. BMC Nursing (2022) 21:316
2 (intramuscular injection); checklist 3 (subcutaneous
injection); checklist 4 (intradermal injection); checklist
5 (range of motion exercises); checklist 6 (heat appli-
cation); checklist 7 (cold application); and checklist 8
(glucocheck). The evaluation items were ranked using a
three-point Likert scale (0 or omitted, totally incorrect;
1, partially correct performance; and 2, correct perfor-
mance) [49].
Validity and reliability
Tools II, III, and IV were translated into Arabic and back-
translated to English. All tools were face validated by a
jury of seven specialists in the medical surgical nursing
field, and all tools had good validity with an average con-
tent validity index of 1.0. A pilot study was conducted
involving 20 nursing students to test the clarity and relia-
bility of the tools, and these students were excluded from
the study. Cronbach’s α was calculated and was 0.93 for
tool II, 0.84 for tool III, 0.89 for tool IV, and 0.95 for tool
VI.
Data collection
This was a single blinded trial where the data collectors
were blinded to the study groups during the entire study
period. After informed written consent was obtained,
the students were randomly distributed to the interven-
tion and control groups. The assistant staff gathered data
for 11 weeks at three timepoints in the second academic
semester (2020–2021) (Fig. 1). Timepoint 0 (T0) cov-
ers the first 2 weeks, and timepoints 1 (T1) and 2 (T2)
cover the subsequent 3 weeks. Before each class session,
tool IV was used to assess the IOP, and after each session,
tools III and VI were used to assess the students’ confi-
dence and skill levels. At the end of each timepoint, tool
IV was used to assess the students’ knowledge level, and
the mean overall IOP, confidence, and skill competency
over weeks were calculated. Tool II was used to assess the
students’ motivation at T0 and the end of the study. Data
collectors were trained on assessment tools and ensure
no missed data during evaluation.
Intervention
The two groups were taught once a week (120 min) in the
laboratory skills with the same six instructors and con-
tent. In the first 2 weeks, both groups received routine
FC instructions, which included a 2-h skill video and one
multiple choice quiz related to pre-class materials, which
were uploaded to the Moodle page 1 week before clinical
lab training, whereas class activities included demonstra-
tion by the instructor and re-demonstration of skills on
simulators by the students; 3 case scenarios; and a peer
evaluation checklist. Then, after collecting baseline data,
Moodle was gamified over the remaining 6 weeks for the
Page 5 of 13
students in the intervention group, and game elements
included three gamified quizzes on each skill (i.e., easy,
moderate, and high difficulty), badges, leaderboards,
ranks, levels/unlocks, and points (Fig. 2). The gamified
activities were shown to the intervention group only, and
the students in the intervention group were instructed
to not share their accounts with other students until the
completion of this study. The students could compete and
make maximum points and badges through this online
motivation. The instructor used the Active Presenter and
Hot Potatoes software and game module in designing the
gamified quizzes. The quiz contained videos and images
along with the text. Several question classifications (e.g.,
matching, true/false; multiple choices, drag and drop,
and fill in the blanks) and several quiz forms (e.g., cross-
words, race to treasure, and millionaire quiz) with a total
of 18 game quizzes and levels were used in the course.
For the study participants, 25 points were given for
watching the course materials, and 5 points were given
for each correctly answered question in gamified quiz-
zes. Easy game quizzes contain 5 questions; a moderate
quiz consists of 10 questions in crossword form; and a
difficult quiz contains 15 questions in millionaire quiz
form. Students who passed a difficult quiz were given an
extra 25 points. The system would automatically provide
the pupils with a new online badge after they reached
100 points. Each level unlocks after passing the previous
level. Students with the highest rank in each level were
provided with another medal badge, and for each set of
levels, students were awarded with a new badge as well.
Therefore, the more the students took the game quizzes
and passed them, the more points they earned and the
more badges they got. However, the control group and
students who didn’t agree to participate in the program
did not receive any intervention, except for their routine
FC education. The game activities were also shown to
the control group at the end of the study, after the post-
test phase, and before final exams. The dosage of gami-
fication in our study was based on Sanchez, Langer, and
Kaur (2020) [52], who used several game quizzes on each
topic, for a total of 34 game quizzes over 13 weeks. Fur-
thermore, the quiz difficulty was based on (Aşksoy, 2018)
[24], who used different quiz difficulties for each topic.
The number of questions per game quiz in the literature
varies between 5 (Sanchez, Langer, and Kaur (2020) [52]
and 20 (Zainuddin, 2018) [31].
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation,
and frequency) and inferential statistics (i.e., paired
t-test, independent t-test, repeated-measures analysis
of variance [ANOVA], and chi-square test) were used.
Moreover, four 3

performed. The dependent variables were skills perfor-
mance, confidence, knowledge, and IOP; the independent
variables were time (T0, T1, and T2) and group (inter-
vention or control). The outcomes of the program were
evaluated by comparing the rating scale results according
to (a) the test period (T0 vs. T1 and T1 vs. T2) using a
contrast test with the pre-test as the reference and (b) the
group (study vs. control) at the three test periods. Data
analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences, version 20, and the significance level
was set at p < 0.05. There were no missing data. For this
study, using 2 way repeated measures ANOVA and t test
was appropriate without fear of violating assumptions
of normality because the central limit theorem applied
when samples in both groups were > 30 [53–55].
Results
Demographic characteristics
Data on the demographic characteristics of the groups
were checked for homogeneity (Table 1). No substantial
differences in sex, secondary school location, economic
status, interest in the Fundamentals of Nursing course,
interest in the nursing profession, degree of participa-
tion, Fundamentals of Nursing I grade, decision to join
the nursing profession, and plans after graduation were
observed between the two groups.

Skills performance, confidence, knowledge, and IOP scores
Table 2 presents the means and standard deviations of
the four dependent variables under study at the three
test periods along with the repeated-measures ANOVA

Bonferroni adjustment revealed that the students’ con-
fidence level increased significantly from T0 to T1 and
from T0 to T2, but not from T1 to T2.
Regarding skills knowledge, repeated-measures
ANOVA revealed a significant difference in time (F

with Bonferroni adjustment revealed that the students’
knowledge level increased significantly from T0 to T1,
from T0 to T2, and from T1 to T2.
Regarding skills preparation intensity, repeated-
measures ANOVA revealed a significant difference in
time (F (2)

with Bonferroni adjustment revealed that the students’
IOP increased significantly from T0 to T1, from T0 to
T2, and from T1 to T2.
Motivation scores
No statistically significant difference in the mean pre-test
motivation score was observed between the two groups
(Table 3). However, the mean post-test motivation score
was significantly higher in the intervention group than in
the control group (p < 0.001). Moreover, a statistically sig-
nificant difference was observed between the mean pre-
test and post-test motivation scores in the intervention
group (p < 0.013); however, no significant difference was
observed between the mean pre-test and post-test moti-
vation scores in the control group.
Correlation among the measured variables after gamified
FC intervention
At T2, a significant positive correlation was found
between learning motivation and skills knowledge
(r
=
0.201, p < 0.022). Additionally, a significant positive
correlation was observed between confidence and skills
knowledge (r
=
0.373, p < 0.002) and skills performance
(r
=
0.247, p < 0.049). Moreover, a significant positive cor-
relation was observed between skill performance and
skills knowledge (r
=
0.409, p < 0.001). Lastly, a signifi-
cant positive correlation was observed between IOP and
skills confidence (r
=
0.306, p < 0.014), skills knowledge

Discussion
The nursing education focus is on enhancing learners’
intrinsic motivation and improving their skills compe-
tency in the field of nursing. In this study, it is expected
that the participants in the intervention group will have
better skills performance. However, although the inter-
vention group had higher scores than the control group,
the difference was not statistically significant. This result
agrees with the results of Mekler et al. [33] and Sailer
and Sailer [36], who reported that the elements of the
games (i.e., game quiz, badges, and leaderboard) did not
significantly affect the competence of the students. How-
ever, this is in contrast with the findings of Lai et al. [56],
who reported a significant improvement in practical skill
scores in medical students of the study group, and this
may be because group teaching was face to face (lectures
and hands on training). Furthermore, gamification activi-
ties were administered in class, and the researcher used
gamification elements, in addition to game-based learn-
ing strategies (3 games) during the class. Another study
by Kim and Kim [43] reported that gamified FC learn-
ing increases students’ empathy with patients; this may
be because gamification was used in and out of classes,
and the researcher combined gamification with other
teaching methods, including situation-based learning;
however, this study compared gamified learning with
traditional learning, and the study groups were from
different academic years. This may raise the questions
of whether gamifying laboratory skill training sessions
(in and out of class) and whether adding serious games
in addition to gamification to FC learning would help
improve skill scores compared with FC. Furthermore, in
our study, the students could view the skill videos and
practice the gamified activities 1 week before each proce-
dure, and their levels of skill performance were assessed
immediately. Students at the fundamental level need
many training and practice time. Hence, to differentiate
skills between the two groups, 1 week may not be ade-
quate [49].
In this study, a positive correlation was found between
skill performance, skills knowledge, and confidence.
This result agrees with those of Tan et al. [7], who also
reported a significant positive correlation between

knowledge, skill performance, and confidence. In con-
trast, a study by Lee et al. [49] reported an insignificant
correlation between knowledge, skill performance, and
confidence. This may be because in this study, mobile-
based video learning did not significantly affect the stu-
dents’ knowledge or skill performance; moreover, most
study participants were females (approximately 90%),
whereas, in our study, approximately half of students
were males. The self-efficacy of learners in using digital
devices has been linked to sex differences as a potential
influencer [57]. Furthermore, motivation behind gamifi-
cation engagement is different between sexes, and males
play more games; thus, competition is a great component
for male students [58]. This raises the question: which
game elements are appropriate for students based on sex
differences?
In terms of confidence, a significant difference was
found between both groups, and this was supported by
Forndran and Zacharias[38] and Ekici [40], who reported
that the students’ self-confidence was positively impacted
by gamified FC learning. This finding also agrees with
those of Sung and Hwang [59], who reported that stu-
dents of gamified classes felt more confident, competent,
and engaged in classroom activities. In our opinion, this
is because the students were given instant task-level feed-
back, which have been proven to help boost students’
confidence during the gamified intervention [31].
The results of this study indicated that gamification
has a strong positive effect on the students’ skills knowl-
edge. As reported by Zainuddin [31], the gamification
of quizzes made pre-class content easier for students to
be seriously learned. A study by Lai et al. [56] involv-
ing medical students reported significant improvements
in the knowledge of the students in the gamified group.
Also, our findings are consistent with those of [60–63]
who reported a significant improvement in the knowl-
edge level of the gamified group. In contrast, a study by
Trevino et al. [64] and Lee et al. [65] reported that educa-
tional games had a similar impact on the knowledge level
as attending an engaging, didactic lecture. Moreover, a
study by Selby et al. [66] reported that the interactive lec-
ture group had better knowledge than the game group,
and this was interpreted as during game playing, the stu-
dents have other distractions, whereas lectures forced
students to focus on facts. However, those three studies
used game-based learning, not gamified FC learning.
Another important implication emerging from these
study findings is the IOP, which was significantly dif-
ferent between both groups. Furthermore, our results
demonstrated significant correlations among the stu-
dents’ IOP, skill knowledge, skill performance, and skill
confidence. This finding agrees with those of Poondej
and Lerdpornkulrat [67], Mohamed and Lamia [68] and
Page 10 of 13
Huang et al. [41] who proved that students in a gamified
FC environment were more likely to complete homework
and other pre- and post-class assignments on time than
those in a non-gamified environment. Additionally, Jo
et al. [69] applied gamification to an FC and were suc-
cessful in raising students’ preparation. Another study by
Sailer & and Sailer [36] reported that the students’ prepa-
ration level had a great impact on the performance of the
learning process. Therefore, gamification can be an inter-
vention to support extracurricular activities and thereby
promote student preparation [69].
After gamification, the study group’s motivation levels
in all four areas (i.e., relevance, attention, satisfaction,
and confidence) were significantly higher than those of
the control group. This finding agrees with that of Inangil
et al. [60], who reported significantly higher attention,
satisfaction, and total motivation score among the nurs-
ing students in the gamified group than control group.
Other studies by Aşıksoy [24] and White and Shellen-
barger [70] reported that gamified FCs increase student
motivation and that badges guaranteed that students
actively participated in classroom activities, made com-
petitive environments in a positive way, enhanced peer
relationships and generate formative feedback. Another
study by Sailer and Sailer [36] reported that a gamified
quiz can increase students’ feelings of social belong-
ing and intrinsic motivation. Matching with this result,
many studies have reported that education gamification
positively affects participation and motivation [39, 42, 60,
71–73]. In contrast, a study by Mekler et al. [33] reported
that motivation was not affected by gamification. Moti-
vational shortage due to the implementation of gamifi-
cation was because the required tasks to complete could
hardly be considered challenging and game elements (i.e.,
points, leaderboards, and levels) were evaluated sepa-
rately for three groups of students. These findings agree
with those of Sailer and Sailer [36], who reported that
the choice of questions and the gamified quiz design are
critical because motivation might differ depending on the
quiz difficulty.
Limitations
However, this study has many limitations. First, there
are few similar randomized controlled trials with which
to compare our results. Most randomized controlled tri-
als were not comparable because they either used game-
based learning or the control group used conventional
teaching and not FC learning and the subjects were not
usually higher education nursing students. Furthermore,
it is noted that the terms game-based learning and gami-
fication are used synonymously in many studies, despite
their mechanism differences. Second, although the pilot
reliability was assessed in the preliminary test, variance
Elzeky et al. BMC Nursing (2022) 21:316
among the three evaluators was inevitable and might
affect the results. Moreover, the results cannot be gen-
eralized on a national scale because the students under
study were from a single university. Furthermore, the
Hawthorne effect cannot be ignored because the par-
ticipants were aware that they were under assessment to
evaluate the effectiveness of gamification, which thus may
have led to a bias. Finally, passive learners may attempt to
ask active students about the answers and achieve badges
also without watching the video lessons and this further
affect the skill scores. Although game quizzes add fun
to the course and foster collaboration and competition
among the students, other forms of gamification chal-
lenges may be required to obtain valid results of the stu-
dents’ learning achievements in a gamified FC course.
Conclusion and recommendations
This study demonstrated that Fundamentals of Nurs-
ing students learning in a gamified FC had better skills
knowledge, confidence, and motivation and were well
prepared before clinical classes than those learning in a
conventional FC. The gamification elements in this study
(i.e., badges, game quizzes, leaderboards, points, level
unlock, and ranks) created a positive competitive envi-
ronment and fostered the students’ motivation. Gami-
fied FC learning can be considered an effective teaching
method for delivering learning materials to nursing stu-
dents to enhance their motivation and skills competence.
However, further research must compare gamified
FCs with FC learning; examine its effect on learning out-
comes, student satisfaction, and confidence; and explore
factors affecting gamified FC learning outcomes in nurs-
ing education. Future studies are necessary to ascertain
whether sex differences or individuals in some subgroups,
such as students having low academic degrees, may earn
more from participating in gamified FC learning. Future
studies should compare both gamified FC and game-
based FC interventions with each other and with controls
and evaluate psychomotor skill acquisition and patient
outcomes. Moreover, they should investigate the combin-
ing effects of gamification and serious games in FC learn-
ing and their effects on skill scores. Furthermore, these
studies should compare in and out of class gamification
in FC learning or the combination of both and their
effect on learning outcomes. To increase the validity of
the effectiveness of the gamification technique compared
with the traditional method, a more thorough assessment
process, including final test scores, should be performed.
The long-term effects of gamification are important to be
studied, to evaluate the long-term effects of game designs
on user behavior.
