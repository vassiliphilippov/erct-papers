The role of subsequent school contexts in the long-term effects of early childhood interventions has received
increasing attention, but has been understudied in the literature. Using data from the Chicago School Readi-
ness Project (CSRP), a cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted in Head Start programs, we investigate
whether the intervention had differential effects on academic and behavioral outcomes in kindergarten if
children attended high- or low-performing schools subsequent to the preschool intervention year. To address
the issue of selection bias, we adopt an innovative method, principal score matching, and control for a set of
child, mother, and classroom covariates. We find that exposure to the CSRP intervention in the Head Start
year had significant effects on academic and behavioral outcomes in kindergarten for children who subse-
quently attended high-performing schools, but no significant effects on children attending low-performing
schools. Policy implications of the findings are discussed.

1. Introduction
The early school years, especially from kindergarten to third grade,
are a critical transitional period not only for promoting children's
scholastic and psychosocial development but also for preventing the
dissipating effects of earlier interventions (Reynolds, Magnuson, &
Ou, 2006, 2010). Research has suggested that the benefits of high-
quality early interventions can be sustained in later school years and
even into adulthood for participants who attend continuing enrich-
ment programs in the early school years, particularly so for those
from low-income families, but that benefits tend to fade out by the
second or third year of formal schooling for participants who subse-
quently attend inferior schools (Currie, 2001; Currie & Thomas,
1995, 2000; Lee & Loeb, 1995; Magnuson, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2007;
Reynolds et al., 2007; Reynolds, Temple, White, Ou, & Robertson,
2011; Takanishi & Bogard, 2007). Therefore, in the investigation of
long-term effects of early childhood interventions, it is important to
take into account the role of participants' subsequent school experi-
ences, especially the quality and performance of the schools they
attend. Research as to the mechanisms of how later schools promote

or hinder the initial gains fostered by early interventions is likely to
have important policy implications for the design and improvement
of effective interventions targeting disadvantaged children.
However, largely due to the lack of data on the quality or perfor-
mance of later schools, few empirical studies have examined directly
their role in the long-term effects of early childhood interventions.
When the data do exist, selection bias remains an important issue.
On the one hand, economically disadvantaged children such as Head
Start participants tend to attend low-quality or low-performing
schools compared to their counterparts, which could undermine
their earlier gains (Currie & Thomas, 1995, 2000; Hastings &
Weinstein, 2008; Lee & Loeb, 1995; Pigott & Israel, 2005). On the
other hand, children's enrollment in higher versus lower performing
schools may be endogenous to, or affected by, exposure to an initial
treatment such as preschool interventions (Hong & Raudenbush,
2008). Evidence shows that enrollment in schools of different quality
is associated with children's later outcomes (Hastings & Weinstein,
2008). As such, analyses that do not consider the role of subsequent
schools may result in biased estimates of the long-term effects of
early childhood interventions.
We use data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted
in Head Start programs, the Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP),
to investigate whether the academic performance of subsequent
schools mattered in sustaining the effects of the CSRP intervention
on children's academic and behavioral outcomes in kindergarten. As
detailed below, in the analyses we employ a principal score matching
method to address the issue of selection bias.
1.1. Background and prior research
Studies conducted over the last two decades and beyond have
consistently shown that the benefits of many high-quality early inter-
ventions, especially cognitive gains from programs targeting econom-
ically disadvantaged children such as Head Start, tend to dissipate
after only a few years of formal schooling (see research and reviews
by Barnett, 1995; Currie & Thomas, 1995, 2000; Lee & Loeb, 1995;
Magnuson et al., 2007; U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services [USDHHS], 2010). A common explanation for the fade-out
of initial gains from early interventions is the low-quality of schools
that participants subsequently attend (Currie, 2001; Currie &
Thomas, 2000; Lee & Loeb, 1995; Magnuson et al., 2007). Research
has suggested that children in economically disadvantaged families
who attended high-quality preschool programs such as Head Start
were systematically more likely to attend low-quality and low-
performing schools compared to their counterparts, which may be
due to residential proximity, parental expectations of low return to
education, and budget constraints in educational spending (Currie &
Thomas, 1995, 2000; Hastings & Weinstein, 2008; Lee & Loeb, 1995;
Pigott & Israel, 2005). For example, evidence from the Early Child-
hood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998–99 (ECLS-K), a
nationally representative sample, shows that compared to other chil-
dren, Head Start participants tended to attend schools with lower
average levels of socio-economic status, lower achievement in math
and reading, more minority children, and more children eligible for
free lunch (Pigott & Israel, 2005).
From the perspectives of life cycle skill formation and human cap-
ital accumulation, as well as developmental cascades theory, continu-
ing and enriching school environments can facilitate the ongoing skill
acquisition and school achievement of children with skill advantages
gained from high-quality early interventions, and can also compen-
sate for the skill deficits experienced by at-risk children at school
entry (Cunha, Heckman, Lochner, & Masterov, 2006; Hamre & Pianta,
2005; Magnuson et al., 2007; Masten & Cicchetti, 2010). As a result,
high-performing schools that children attend subsequent to preschool
interventions may be able to reinforce their initial gains and make
early interventions more effective (Cunha et al., 2006). For example,
recent results from the Child-Parent Center (CPC) Early Education Pro-
gram, which included services for low-income children from age 3 to
third grade, demonstrated that continuing intervention strengthened
learning gains from preschool and was independently associated with
school performance leading to adult well-being (Reynolds et al., 2011).
In contrast, low-quality learning environments and unchallenging
programs may undermine children's earlier gains and the advantages
fostered by initial interventions (Currie & Thomas, 2000; Lee & Loeb,
1995).
In these and some other studies on the role of schools, school aca-
demic performance has typically been indexed by the percentage of
students meeting or exceeding performance benchmarks in standard-
ized tests of math or reading (Currie & Thomas, 2000; Hanushek,
1986; Lee & Loeb, 1995). Families as well as educators recognize the im-
portance of test-score-based ratings of school quality with academic
performance of schools serving as one of the most important factors
in parents' school choices (Schneider, Teske, Marshall, & Roch, 1998;
Weidner & Herrington, 2000). Evidence from experimental studies
shows that parents in low-income families were more likely to choose
higher-performing schools if they received direct information on school
test scores (Hastings & Weinstein, 2008). Other studies have shown
that when low school performance information was publicly dissemi-
nated, students, especially those from low-income neighborhoods,
were more likely to switch their schools (Friesen, Javdani, Smith, &
Woodcock, 2011; Howell, 2006). Moreover, high-performing schools
appear to make significant differences in the experiences and outcomes
of low-income children. For example, high-performing schools, espe-
cially those in low-income neighborhoods, have been associated with
F. Zhai et al. / Children and Youth Services Review 34 (2012) 946–954

a more caring and nurturing environment characterized by high expec-
tations for staff and students, effective leadership, committed teachers,
and a strong focus on academics, instruction, and student learning
(Carter, 2000; Kannapel & Clements, 2005; McGee, 2004; Wolf &
Hoople, 2006). Experimental studies found that attending high-
performing schools significantly increased low-income students' test
scores (Hastings & Weinstein, 2008).
Although the role of school academic performance in the long-
term effects of early interventions has received increasing attention
recently, few empirical studies have been conducted to investigate
their role directly. One common challenge is that the chance of attend-
ing higher- versus lower-performing schools may differ for partici-
pants and non-participants, which may, in turn, contribute to the
long-term outcomes of interest. As described above, the probability
of children's subsequent enrollment in higher- versus lower-
performing schools may be systematically different for economically
disadvantaged children compared to their counterparts, and impor-
tantly, may also be a function of the initial intervention. For example,
the cognitive and social-emotional benefits that participants gain from
high-quality preschool interventions may motivate their parents to
pursue better schools. In the CSRP, children in the intervention
group had significantly better developmental outcomes than those
in the control group at the end of the 9-month intervention during
the Head Start year, including improvement in self-regulation and ac-
ademic skills as well as reductions in emotional and behavioral diffi-
culties (Raver et al., 2009, 2011). In addition, preliminary evidence
suggests that children in the CSRP intervention group were signifi-
cantly more likely to enroll in high-performing schools in kindergar-
ten than children in the control group, even after adjusting for child
and mother covariates as well as teacher and classroom characteristics
in Head Start year (Zhai & Raver, 2010). Taken together, these results
suggest that we run the risk of incorporating considerable bias into
our estimates of the long-term effects of the initial intervention unless
we also take the performance of those subsequent schools into ac-
count in our models. The present study therefore takes careful steps
to minimize the risk of this bias, as we outline below.
1.2. The present study
In this study, we use data from the CSRP to investigate whether ex-
posure to the intervention during the Head Start year had differential
effects on children's academic (i.e., language, literacy, and math) and
behavioral outcomes (i.e., internalizing and externalizing behavior
problems) in kindergarten if children subsequently attended either
high- or low-performing schools. To do this we conduct separate
analyses for children who subsequently attended high-performing
schools and for those who were enrolled in low-performing schools,
and then examine whether the CSRP intervention effects were differ-
ent between these two groups of children.
Building on prior research (Currie & Thomas, 2000; Hanushek,
1986; Lee & Loeb, 1995), we define low- and high-performing schools
based on school-level aggregates of students' standardized test scores.
As detailed below, we adopt a principal score matching method to ad-
dress the issue of selection bias and control for a set of child, mother,
and classroom covariates.
2. Method
2.1. Procedure and participants
The CSRP used a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) de-
sign and a pairwise matching procedure (Bloom, 2005). Two cohorts
of children and teachers from 18 Head Start sites in seven of the
most economically disadvantaged neighborhoods of Chicago partici-
pated in the CSRP intervention. Cohort One (from 10 Head Start
sites) participated from fall to spring in 2004–05 and Cohort Two
948 F. Zhai et al. / Children and Youth Services Review 34 (2012) 946–954
(from 8 Head Start sites) participated from fall to spring in 2005–06.
Nine pairs of matched sites were first identified based on a range of
site-level demographic characteristics that were collected by each
site and reported annually to the federal government. One site in
each matched pair was then randomly assigned to the intervention
group and the other to the control group. Two classrooms were ran-
domly selected from each site. After the randomized assignment,
one classroom in the control group from Cohort Two left the study
due to Head Start funding cuts. The original design and methods
have subjected to rigorous review and are described in detail in previ-
ous studies (e.g., Raver et al., 2009, 2011).
Overall, a total of 602 children and 90 teachers in 35 classrooms
from 18 Head Start sites participated in the CSRP. Children in the
CSRP, on average, were 4 years old and about half were boys. Approx-
imately 66% of participating children were non-Hispanic Black, 26%
were Hispanic, and 8% were from other racial or ethnic groups.
Teachers, on average, were 40 years old and almost all (i.e., 97%)
were female. About 70% of teachers were non-Hispanic Black, 20%
were Hispanic, and 10% were non-Hispanic White.
As detailed below, we use the school records of the Illinois Stan-
dards Achievement Test (ISAT) from the Chicago Public Schools
(CPS) to define school performance. Only 60% of children in the orig-
inal CSRP sample (n = 361) attended schools with available ISAT data
and are therefore included in the analysis. For a variety of reasons
(e.g., being too young to attend elementary schools, attending private
schools, or other reasons), the remaining children (n = 241) were not
in schools with available ISAT data and thus are not included in the
analysis. As shown in Appendix A Table 1, while there did not appear
to be differential exclusion from the analysis group by CSRP interven-
tion status (i.e., roughly equal numbers of children were excluded
from both groups), there was a fair amount of variation in the type
of differences between the included and excluded groups by inter-
vention status. For example, in the CSRP intervention group, com-
pared to children included in the analysis, excluded children were
less likely to be non-Hispanic Black, to have low educated mothers,
to have mothers working 10 h or less per week, or to have family in-
come below 50% poverty line; they attended Head Start programs
with higher quality but had lower cognitive skills at baseline. In the
CSRP control group, compared to children included in the analysis,
excluded children were younger and attended Head Start programs
with higher scores of emotional climate, but had lower cognitive
skills and more behavior problems at baseline.
Therefore, while statistically significant differences exist between
children included in and those excluded from the analysis sample,
these differences vary and their impacts on the estimate of CSRP inter-
vention effects given the academic performance of subsequent schools
are unknown.
2.2. Intervention services
The CSRP intervention aimed to support low-income, ethnic minor-
ity preschoolers' development of self-regulation, reduce their risk of be-
havioral difficulty, and increase their opportunities for learning through
the improvement of teachers' positive emotional support and effective
classroom management strategies (Raver et al., 2009). In particular,
four components of services were provided in the intervention group.
The first was a 30-hour teacher training focusing on behavior manage-
ment strategies, which were adapted from the Incredible Years teacher
training module (Webster-Stratton, Reid, & Hammond, 2004). All
intervention-assigned teachers were invited to participate in the five
6-hour training sessions held on Saturdays from September to March
during the Head Start year. Paired with the training, the second compo-
nent was the placement of mental health consultants (MHCs) in inter-
vention classrooms. MHCs attended classes one morning per week to
coach teachers in implementing the behavior management strategies
as well as to assist teachers with stress reduction. The third component
was the stress reduction workshops provided by MHCs. In the second
10 weeks of the intervention, MHCs held a one-day stress reduction
workshop for each Head Start site to help teachers relieve work-
related stress, reduce burnout, and strengthen their ability and confi-
dence both in managing children's disruptive behaviors and in meeting
children's needs. The fourth component included individual mental
health consultation services for a small number of children (3–4 chil-
dren per class) with high emotional and behavioral problems from
March to May in the Head Start year.
To ensure that the child-staff ratio was similar across intervention
and control classrooms, teachers in the control group were given
staffing support by a teacher's aide who only provided additional
staffing support during everyday classroom activities for the same
amount of time per week as the MHCs in the intervention group.
2.3. Measures
2.3.1. School performance measures
Following from prior research (Currie & Thomas, 2000; Hanushek,
1986; Lee & Loeb, 1995), we use school-level students' overall perfor-
mance on Illinois standardized tests, the ISAT, as an indicator of school
academic performance. The ISAT is designed to measure the achieve-
ment of individual students from 3rd to 8th grade relative to the Illinois
Learning Standards. Overall, the schools that children in the CSRP
attended tended to have slightly lower academic performance than the
CPS (e.g., 56% of students meeting or exceeding ISAT reading vs. 61% in
the CPS; 63% of students meeting or exceeding ISAT math vs. 69% in
the CPS). The schools that CSRP participants attended also had more
low-income students than the CPS, overall (e.g., 92% of students eligible
for free or reduced-price lunch vs. 83% in the CPS). That said, the range in
the academic performance and poverty level of schools in which CSRP
students were enrolled was remarkably wide (with about 5% of CSRP
students attending schools with more than 75% of students meeting or
exceeding ISAT reading and more than 85% of students meeting or ex-
ceeding ISAT math, for example). This heterogeneity in school enroll-
ment patterns allowed us to draw the comparisons outlined below.
Based on school-level reports of the percentage of students meet-
ing or exceeding state standards for math or reading from the CPS, we
categorize schools into a high- or a low-performing group. High-
performing schools are defined as those schools whose percentage
of students meeting or exceeding state standards for math or reading
was beyond 0.5 standard deviations above the mean in the distribu-
tion of schools in the sample (i.e., 62% or more students meeting or
exceeding state standards, or about the top quartile of the distribu-
tion). Low-performing schools were in the bottom of the distribution,
in which the percentage of students meeting or exceeding state stan-
dards for math or reading was 0.5 standard deviations below the
mean (i.e., 48% or fewer students meeting or exceeding state stan-
dards, or approximately the bottom one third of the distribution).
The comparison between the top high-performing schools and the
bottom low-performing schools may help tease out the roles of school
performance in the investigation of CSRP effects; while schools in the
middle of the distribution are more similar in academic performance
and thus may not show different impacts on CSRP participants. De-
scriptive statistics show that CSRP children in low-performing schools
tend to be more disadvantaged than those in high-performing schools
(e.g., 53% with their mother working 10 h or less per week compared
to 37% of children in high-performing schools, and 56% with family
income-to-needs ratios at less than half the federal poverty threshold
compared to 39% of children in high-performing schools). This high-
lights the value of including extensive baseline covariates in the anal-
yses outlined below.
2.3.2. Outcome variables
We focus on CSRP intervention effects on children's academic (i.e.,
teacher-reported scores in language, literacy, and math) and behavioral
F. Zhai et al. / Children and Youth Services Review 34 (2012) 946–954
949
outcomes (i.e., teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing behav-
ior problems) in kindergarten. Teachers completed the surveys be-
tween November and February in the kindergarten year.
Academic outcomes were measured using a modified version of
the Academic Rating Scale (ARS; Rock, Pollack, & Hausken, 2002).
The ARS was designed to indirectly assess the process and products
of children's learning in school and is meant to be a supplement to di-
rect measures of cognitive outcomes. The ARS is targeted to a specific
grade level and items contain explicit objective elements and subjec-
tive elements that would correspond to that grade level. Teachers
compare the target child to their same age peers on a 1–5 scale (i.e.,
not yet, beginning, in progress, intermediate, and proficient). We
use two aggregated measures as academic outcome variables in kin-
dergarten, including language and literacy (12 items; α = 0.95) and
mathematical thinking (8 items; α = 0.95).
Children's behavioral outcomes in kindergarten were measured
using teachers' reports on the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form (C-TRF;
Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001). The measure consists of 100 items asking
the respondent to rate the child on a scale from 0 to 2 (where 0 = not
true, 1 = somewhat or sometimes true, and 2 = very true or often
true). Responses are summed into Internalizing (32 items; α = 0.89)
and Externalizing (34 items; α = 0.96) subscales.
2.3.3. Baseline covariates
The covariates in the analysis include child and mother characteris-
tics as well as classroom quality-related indicators collected at baseline
in the fall of the Head Start year (i.e., pre-intervention). Specifically,
child demographics include child gender, age, race/ethnicity (i.e., non-
Hispanic Black or not), and pre-intervention scores in academic and be-
havioral development. The CSRP did not include pre-intervention aca-
demic and behavioral data using the same measures employed in the
kindergarten year (i.e., language and literacy, mathematical thinking,
and C-TRF Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior Problems). We use
data on academic and behavioral development collected at baseline
with similar measures to control for pre-intervention status for the re-
spective outcome variables. In particular, for the outcome of language
and literacy, we control for children's pre-intervention scores on the
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III). As a 24-item scale
(α = 0.78), the PPVT-III was assessed by asking children to identify
one out of four pictures that corresponded to the word or action spoken
by the assessor (Dunn & Dunn, 1997; Zill, 2003a). For mathematical
thinking, we adopt scores in the Early Math Skills at baseline, which
consists of 19 items (α = 0.82) that cover basic addition and subtraction
(Zill, 2003b). For C-TRF outcome measures, we control for pre-
intervention scores on the Behavior Problems Index (BPI) reported by
teachers. The BPI was adapted from a 28-item rating scale originally
designed for parent report of child behavior problems (Zill, 1990). Fol-
lowing recommendations from the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth (NLSY; Zill, 1990), the items are summed to form two domains:
Internalizing (α = 0.80) and Externalizing (α = 0.92).
Mother characteristics include mother's marital status (i.e.,
whether mother was married at baseline) and family poverty-
related risks, including mother holding less than high school diploma,
mother working 10 h or less per week, and family income-to-needs
ratio at less than half the federal poverty threshold. Many preventive
interventions targeting low-income children have demonstrated the
importance of accounting for the potential confounders of child and
family demographic characteristics (see for example, Aber, Brown, &
Jones, 2003; Schaeffer et al., 2006; Tolan, Gorman-Smith, & Henry,
2004). As shown in previous analyses with large, nationally represen-
tative datasets, these factors represent the most reduced and infor-
mative set of indicators of families' exposure to deep poverty
(Raver, Garner, & Smith-Donald, 2007).
Finally, research suggests that interventions in settings with dif-
ferent institutional resources may work differently (Gottfredson,
Jones, & Gore, 2002). Thus, we include a set of classroom covariates
at baseline as proxies to represent classroom quality and environ-
ment. Classroom quality was assessed using the Early Childhood En-
vironment Rating Scale-R (ECERS-R; Harms, Clifford, & Cryer, 2003)
and the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS; La Paro,
Pianta, & Stuhlman, 2004). Based on 43 items, the ECERS-R is a widely
used research tool that measures early childhood classroom quality
across a wide range of constructs. We use the total ECRS-R scores as
an indicator of classroom overall quality in the fall of Head Start
year. The CLASS indicators include 7-point Likert scores on classroom
emotional climate and teacher behavior management skills. In addi-
tion, based on the number of children and adults observed in class-
rooms during the CSRP data collection, we also include student–
staff ratio to control for the potential confounding of differences in
class size or staffing ratios.
2.3.4. Missing data
In the analysis sample a small number of children had missing
values on the outcome measures and child and mother covariates. Al-
though not completely overlapping, about 2–8% of the children had
missing data on mother covariates and 7–18% on pre-intervention
and kindergarten outcome measures. Complete case analyses on all
valid outcome measures and covariates would reduce the sample to
258 children, a reduction of more than one quarter of the analysis
sample (n = 361). Since our analysis sample was already relatively
small, such a substantial reduction in size would further limit the sta-
tistical power of the analyses and make it harder to conduct principal
score matching (Hill, Reiter, & Zanutto, 2004; Little & Rubin, 1987).
We adopt a multiple imputation (MI) method to address the issue
of missing data. MI uses multiple predictions for each missing value of
certain variables, based on other observed variables, to account for the
uncertainty in imputed values (Guo & Fraser, 2009; Hill, Waldfogel, &
Brooks-Gunn, 2002; Hill et al., 2004; Rubin, 1987; Schafer, 1997). We
include child, mother, and classroom covariates as well as the fixed ef-
fects of the original paired Head Start sites in MI to account for the het-
erogeneity existed between paired Head Start sites. We also use a
bootstrap method, which estimates regression coefficients in a boot-
strap sample of the non-missing observations and thus has the advan-
tage of robustness (Royston, 2005; van Buuren, Boshuizen, & Knook,
1999). We generate five sets of imputations for missing data and
perform principal score matching with each dataset separately (Hill
et al., 2004; Little & Rubin, 1987; Rubin, 1987; Schafer, 1997). With
five imputed datasets, the expected relative efficiency (RE) for recov-
ering missing values ranges from 98.2% to 99.5% (Rubin, 1987). After
obtaining the estimates separately from the analyses of five imputed
datasets, we use their means as the final estimates and their standard
errors are obtained using Rubin's (1987) rules for combining MI.
2.4. Analytic strategies
To address the issue of selection bias, as discussed above, we adopt a
principal score matching method that considers selection into post-
intervention treatments, such as enrolling in high-performing schools,
as well as their impacts on the effects of the CSRP intervention on kin-
dergarten outcomes. Principal score matching is a derivative of propen-
sity score matching that builds on recent methodological innovations in
principal stratification and subgroup analysis in the context of random-
ized experiments (Barnard, Frangakis, Hill, & Rubin, 2003; Frangakis &
Rubin, 2002; Gibson, 2003; Hill et al., 2002; Peck, 2003; Zhai et al.,
2010). In the analysis, we conduct three stages of principal score match-
ing to identify children in the control group who would have similar
probabilities of attending high- or low-performing schools in kindergar-
ten to their peers in the CSRP intervention group had they been
assigned to that group initially.
Specifically, in the first stage, we estimate the propensities of
children in the CSRP intervention group to attend high- or low-
performing schools based on their pre-intervention characteristics
950 as well as a set of mother and classroom covariates, using the logit
model specified in Eq. (1):
logit Q i ð Þ ¼ β0 þ β1Xi ð1Þ
where Xi represents the pre-intervention child, mother, and class-
room covariates of child i that possibly influenced his/her propensity
of attending high- or low-performing schools in kindergarten. To ac-
count for the pairwise matching in the CSRP original design, we also
control for the fixed effects of the matched pairs of Head Start sites.
After the logit model is applied in the CSRP intervention group, we
apply the parameters obtained from Eq. (1) to children in the control
group to estimate their probabilities of attending high- or low-
performing schools if they had been assigned to the intervention
group. These probabilities are referred to as principal scores since
they are used to stratify the population into mutually exclusive sub-
groups (i.e., principal strata) based on pre-intervention variables
(Frangakis & Rubin, 2002; Hill et al., 2002).
In the second stage, we use the principal scores resulting from the
first stage to match children who attend high- or low-performing
schools to those in the control group who have similar principal
scores, using a one-to-one nearest neighbor matching method with
replacement. Matching with replacement can minimize biases in esti-
mates since it allows each treatment unit to be matched with the
nearest control unit. Thus it produces higher match quality and is
less sensitive to the order of units than matching without replacement
(Abadie & Imbens, 2002, 2006; Dehejia & Wahba, 2002; Gibson, 2003;
Guo & Fraser, 2009). The RCT design of the CSRP ensured that children
in the intervention and control groups overall had similar characteris-
tics. As a result, children in the control group that had similar charac-
teristics to those in the intervention group who attended high- or
low-performing schools did exist, which makes it possible to find
“matches” in the control group for intervention-assigned children
with similar principal scores (Hill et al., 2002; Peck, 2003; Zhai et al.,
2010).
Finally in the third stage, we use regression-adjusted differences
to estimate the CSRP intervention effects on children's academic and
behavioral outcomes after adjusting the performance of kindergarten
schools. Specifically, we conduct ordinary least squares (OLS) regres-
sions in the sample of matched children, controlling child, mother,
and classroom pre-intervention covariates as presented in Eq. (2):
Oi ¼ β0 þ β1Q i þ β2Xi þ ξi ð2Þ
where Oi represents the outcome (i.e., language and literacy, mathe-
matical thinking, and C-TRF Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior
Problems) of child i; Qistands for a binary variable of school perfor-
mance (1 = high or low performance; 0 = matched control); Xi denotes
child, mother, and classroom characteristics; and ξijk is a random error
term. Huber–White robust standard errors are adopted to account for
the cluster feature of children nested in paired Head Start sites based
on the original CSRP design. Since children were matched with replace-
ment in the second stage, we also apply weights to Eq. (2), which are
calculated as the number of times that matched control units are used
(Dehejia & Wahba, 1999, 2002; Hill et al., 2004).
The process of estimating principal scores and matching are per-
formed separately for low- and high-performing schools and for indi-
vidual outcome variables to control for their corresponding pre-
intervention scores.

intervention condition and matching status. It also presents the sta-
tistical significance levels from t-tests of the mean differences be-
tween high- and low-performing schools, respectively, in Column
(a)“Intervention” and Column (b)“Full Control” (i.e., control group
before matching) with statistical significance levels indicated in Col-
umn (b), as well as the mean differences between Column (a)“Inter-
vention” and Column (c)“Matched Control” (i.e., control groups after
matching) with statistical significance levels, if any, indicated in
Column (c).
As shown in Table 1, among children who attended high-
performing schools subsequent to the Head Start year, those in the
control group tended to be older, were less likely to be non-
Hispanic Black, and were more likely to be from high-performing
classrooms and to have fewer behavior problems at baseline. Similar
differences existed between children in the CSRP intervention and
control groups who subsequently attended low-performing schools.
In addition, compared to those in the intervention group, the mothers
of children in the control group who attended low-performing
schools were more likely to be married and were less likely to work
10 h or less per week or to be in poverty.
Table 1 also shows that after principal score matching, there were
almost no remaining statistically significant differences between the
(c)“Matched Control” and (a)“Intervention” groups. Only two vari-
ables at the classroom level still had marginally significant mean dif-
ferences (at p b 0.10) after matching: teacher behavior management
skills for high-performing schools and emotional climate for low-
performing schools. However, the balance in these two variables has
been improved after matching. Therefore, the principal score match-
ing approach employed in our study overall identifies comparable
control groups for the high- and low-performing schools based on
the observed covariates included in the models. As a result, the
analyses employing the matched samples are likely to reduce selec-
tion bias on the observed covariates in estimating the CSRP interven-
tion effects.
3.2. CSRP effects on children attending high- and low-performing schools
Table 2 presents a summary of the results of the CSRP intervention
effects that combined the estimates from the analyses of five datasets
generated by MI on children who attended high- and low-performing
schools subsequent to the Head Start year. Overall, we find that the
CSRP intervention showed significant effects on children who subse-
quently attended high-performing schools but not on children who
attended low-performing schools.
Specifically, children in the CSRP intervention group who attended
high-performing schools in kindergarten tended to be 0.58 points
higher (i.e., effect size of 0.53 standard deviations [SDs]) in language
and literacy scores than children in the matched control group. The
CSRP intervention did not show statistically significant effects on
mathematical thinking scores of children attending high-performing
schools in kindergarten. With regard to the behavioral outcomes,
compared to children in the matched CSRP control group, children
in the intervention group who attended high-performing schools
tended to have C-TRF Internalizing Behavior Problems ratings that
were 2.99 points lower (i.e., effect size of−0.45 SDs) and C-TRF Ex-
ternalizing Behavioral Problems ratings that were 5.36 points lower
(i.e., effect size of−0.44 SDs).
In contrast, the CSRP intervention did not show statistically signif-
icant effects on the academic or behavioral development of children
who subsequently attended low-performing schools. The signs of
the coefficients would suggest that children in the CSRP intervention
group tended to have lower scores in language and literacy as well as
mathematical thinking and higher scores in C-TRF Internalizing and
Externalizing Behavior Problems than the CSRP control-assigned chil-
dren who also attended low-performing schools in kindergarten.

However, none of the coefficients are statistically different from zero

4. Discussion
Using a subsample from the original CSRP cluster-randomized
evaluation and a principal score matching method to address the
issue of selection bias, we find that the CSRP intervention in the
Head Start year had significant effects on academic and behavioral
outcomes in kindergarten for children who subsequently attended
high-performing schools, but no effects on children attending low-
performing schools.
How can these different sets of findings be reconciled? Children who
were enrolled in CSRP intervention-assigned Head Start classrooms
were exposed to a 9-month preschool intervention where the emotion-
al climate and quality of instruction were substantially improved (Raver
et al., 2008). Moreover, consistent with the intervention theory, chil-
dren in these classrooms showed positive gains in self-regulation, be-
havioral outcomes, and pre-academic skills at the end of the Head
Start year (both literacy and math; Raver et al., 2009, 2011). Among
children in the CSRP intervention-assigned group, there were no statis-
tically significant differences at the end of the Head Start year between
those who later attended low-performing schools and those who later
entered high-performing schools. Nevertheless, the findings in this
paper indicate that children from those preschool intervention-
enrolled classrooms, who then transitioned to higher performing
elementary schools where the instructional quality may have been
sustained, appeared to have maintained their initial learning gains,
when compared to demographically similar children in the control
group who also transitioned to higher performing schools.
In contrast, children who had spent 9 months in emotionally and
behaviorally supportive intervention-enrolled Head Start classrooms
but who then subsequently transitioned to lower performing elemen-
tary schools (schools in which the percentage of students meeting or
exceeding state standards for math or reading was 0.5 standard devi-
ations below the mean) do not significantly differ from their demo-
graphically similar, control-group assigned peers on key learning
outcomes. Taken together, these findings suggest that if the“treat-
ment,” in this case, exposure to higher quality instructional practice
and more emotionally positive classroom climate, is not sustained
across the transition to elementary school, preschool interventions
such as the CSRP may be benefiting some children, while potentially
placing those children who“sort” (or are enrolled) into lower per-
forming schools at greater risk, relative to their control-assigned
peers who transitioned into similar schools. These findings have sub-
stantial implications for developmental science as well as policy re-
search. They provide compelling evidence of processes of human
capital formation (also conceptualized developmental“cascading” or
“canalization”) whereby children's academic outcomes at a given
point in time reflect cumulative exposure to a wide array of time-
varying risks and opportunities across multiple ecological contexts
(Blair & Raver, in press; Masten & Cicchetti, 2010).

These findings are particularly important as we face a period of
deep economic uncertainty, of shrinking federal and state budgets
for education and social programming, and careful scrutiny of practice.
While the field of preschool/pre-kindergarten-based early interven-
tion has made great strides in the last decade, indicating that high-
quality early childhood experiences can make a substantial positive
difference in children's behavioral and academic school readiness,
there exists a relative absence of longitudinal studies describing the
cumulative, multiyear impact of interventions of this type, particularly
those that span developmental and ecological transitions (i.e., through
the transition from preschool to elementary schools; see the body of
work on the Chicago CPC for an exception, e.g., Reynolds et al., 2007,
2011). In addition, prevention scientists face mounting evidence that
the positive effects of exposure to such high quality preschool experi-
ences fade away when children enter kindergarten and are faced with
a new set of social and academic challenges (e.g., Currie & Thomas,
2000; Lee & Loeb, 1995; Reynolds et al., 2006, Reynolds, Magnuson,
& Ou, 2010; USDHHS, 2010).
The CSRP intervention did not provide services to classrooms and
children in kindergarten. However, sophisticated methodological
tools enabled us to examine the influence on children of multi-year
exposure to high quality educational experiences (in Head Start and
then in early elementary school) and to examine controlled variation
in those experiences (e.g., two years of high-quality experiences com-
pared to one year followed by low quality experience). The work pre-
sented here provides support for the value of investing in high quality
early childhood educational programming that is sustained over time,
increasing the likelihood that children maintain successes through
challenging transition from preschool to kindergarten. The findings
also suggest that, consistent with developmental–ecological theory
(Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006; Sameroff, 2010), longer-term ef-
fects of early childhood intervention reflects a dynamic interplay of
child skills and the quality of educational contexts over time. Indeed,
the work underscores a view held by many (e.g., Jones & Zigler, 2002;
Zigler, Gilliam, & Jones, 2006) that preschool intervention may not be
the magic bullet it is frequently believed to be. Moreover, in our case,
there is suggestive evidence that the gains achieved after exposure to
high quality preschool experiences may quickly be lost if they are
subsequently followed by exposure to educational experiences that
are of low quality.
The implications of these findings are both important and sensi-
tive. As state and federal policymakers continue to consider invest-
ments in early education, our work indicates that it is short-sighted
to not simultaneously address equally important efforts to raise and
sustain the quality of kindergarten and early schooling. Our work is
not definitive with regard to potential tradeoffs, as there is emerging
evidence that, even with short-term fade-out of early intervention ef-
fects, important long-term positive effects do emerge (e.g., Deming,
2009; Gibbs, Ludwig, & Miller, 2011). In short, our findings suggest
that policy makers should weigh the tradeoffs involved in making in-
vestments in early education and ways that investments in preschool
may not be worth the time and effort if they are not matched by effort
to raise and sustain quality in kindergarten.
The findings in our study should be interpreted with care. The
CSRP intervention was conducted among a small sample of children
who attended Head Start programs located in seven very disadvan-
taged neighborhoods in Chicago. Moreover, the present study only
uses a subsample (n = 361) of the original CSRP sample (n = 602),
F. Zhai et al. / Children and Youth Services Review 34 (2012) 946–954
953
including only those children in kindergarten schools with available
ISAT records. Children who were too young to attend elementary
schools or who attended private schools are not included in the anal-
ysis. Therefore, the findings presented in this paper should be consid-
ered suggestive. They should be replicated with other samples, and
should be generalized neither to the population nationwide nor to
all the children who originally participated in the CSRP.
In addition, potential biases resulting from the principal score
matching method adopted in our study should be noted. As a deriva-
tive of the propensity score matching approach, a principal score
matching method is subject to the assumption of ignorable treatment
or selection on observables, which requires that all confounding cov-
ariates related to intervention status are observed (Dehejia & Wahba,
1999, 2002; Gibson, 2003; Hill et al., 2002; Joffe & Rosenbaum, 1999;
Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983). If any important covariates were omitted
in the predictive models, then group members could be mismatched
and thus the estimates of CSRP intervention effects could be biased.
As such, our findings should be interpreted with caution.
