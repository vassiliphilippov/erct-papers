Some education policymakers focus on bringing down pupil–teacher ratios. Others argue that resources will have
limited impact without systematic reforms to education governance, teacher incentives, and pedagogy. We examine a program under which school committees at randomly selected Kenyan schools were funded to hire
an additional teacher on an annual contract renewable conditional on performance, outside normal Ministry of
Education civil-service channels, at one-quarter normal compensation levels. For students randomly assigned
to stay with existing classes, test scores did not increase significantly, despite a reduction in class size from 82
to 44 on average. In contrast, scores increased for students assigned to be taught by locally-hired contract
teachers. One reason may be that contract teachers had low absence rates, while centrally-hired civil-service
teachers in schools randomly assigned contract teachers endogenously reduced their effort. Civil-service teachers
also captured rents for their families, with approximately 1/3 of contract teacher positions going to relatives of
existing teachers. A governance program that empowered parents within school committees reduced both
forms of capture. The best contract teachers obtained civil service jobs over time, and we estimate large potential
dynamic benefits from supplementing a civil service system with locally-hired contract teachers brought in on a
probationary basis and granted tenure conditional on performance.

1. Introduction
Despite rapid expansion in school participation over the last decade or so, learning achievements remain poor in developing countries,
and students score very low on internationally comparable tests
(Hanushek and Woessmann, 2010). Some policymakers seeking to address this problem focus on providing more resources (such as teachers
or materials), while others focus on systemic reforms designed to improve governance and provider incentives.
In this paper, we examine how these two approaches can complement each other. In particular, we demonstrate that the impacts of centrally provided resources (in our setting, extra teachers) are muted by

the endogenous response of local officials who misuse them.1 However,
strengthening the power of parents vis-à-vis those officials reduces misappropriation and thereby improves the effectiveness of extra
resources.
Specifically, we consider two policies that are very popular in the
education sector in developing countries: the hiring of teachers on
short-term contracts (subject to renewal by the community), and
School Based Management training programs, designed to empower
local communities (in particular, parents) in how school resources
are used and monitored. Both of these programs are widespread in
developing countries, but have seldom been evaluated. Contract
teachers, hired sometimes centrally and sometimes locally, have
been used in a dozen countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia
and Latin America over the past decade. Muralidharan and
Sundararaman (2013) report that the share of contract teachers
among public school teachers in India grew from 6% in 2003 to 30%
in 2010; they also reference a study by Bourdon et al. (2010) estimating this share to be right around a third across a dozen of countries in
sub-Saharan Africa. School-Based Management (SBM) programs
have likewise been implemented in numerous countries since the
mid-2000s.2 SBM programs primarily consist in transferring decisionmaking authority over some school operations to local school community members. Some of the programs have focused on empowering
headmasters and teachers, in particular with respect to spending (e.g.
SBM reform in The Gambia came hand in hand with a school grant
program, see Blimpo et al., 2011), but most SBM programs have a strong
component aimed at strengthening parental involvement in the
monitoring of the school, typically through the establishment or reinforcement of school committees. The SBM program we study falls in
that category, but is on the “light” side in terms of its time and financial
costs.
We set up an experiment to study how these two reforms can complement each other in the context of a randomized evaluation of the
Extra Teacher Program (ETP) implemented in Kenya between 2005
and 2007. The ETP program provided 70 randomly selected school committees with funds to hire supplemental teachers locally over a two year
period. These teachers were fully qualified — typically recent graduates
of teacher training colleges whose cohorts had not been able to obtain
jobs as civil-service teachers due to freezes on civil-service hiring.
They were placed on short-term contracts under the authority of
school committees composed primarily of parents. The ETP program
followed a well-established practice, as prior to Kenya's abolition of
school fees in 2003, many of these committees used funds levied
from parents to hire and pay extra teachers on short-term and lowpay contracts to supplement the civil-service teachers centrally
assigned to schools. The contracts provided under the ETP program
were renewable after one year, upon approval by the school committee. Contract teachers followed the same curriculum as civil-service
teachers, but rather than focusing on particular subjects, and rotating across grades, as many civil-service teachers do, the newlyhired teachers were assigned to work with a fixed group of firstgrade students.
In a (randomly selected) subset of schools participating in the ETP
program, members of the school committee and interested parents
received a short School-Based Management (SBM) empowerment
training (90 min) on how to interview and select job applicants,
monitor and assess teachers' effort and performance, monitor the
school's management of the program, and perform a formal review
of the contract teacher's performance to decide whether to renew
her contract.
Several features of the experimental design allow us to shed light
on the interaction between extra teachers and governance. First,
within schools sampled for the program, first-grade students were
randomly assigned to either the newly created class taught by the
teacher hired and governed under the ETP program, or to a preexisting class taught by civil-service teachers. This enables us to estimate the impact of the ETP program, alone or combined with SBM,
separately for students assigned to civil-service teachers and those
assigned to contract teachers. We find large differences across
these groups.
Despite a dramatic reduction in the pupil–teacher ratio for grade
1 from 82 to 44, the program generated little improvement in test
scores for students who remained within the standard system (i.e.
assigned to the civil-service teachers). This could be because a class
size of 44 is still too big for much learning to take place. Indeed,
class size experiments ran in the US in the early 20s had found little
effect of class size reductions at that scale (Rockoff, 2009). However,
our results suggest that an endogenous effort response by the
teachers could also be part of the explanation: Civil-service teachers
were 16 percentage points less likely to be found in class teaching if
their school received funding to hire a contract teacher. In contemporaneous work in India, Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2013) also
find that teachers reduce effort in response to hiring additional
teachers.
In contrast, the locally hired and monitored teachers exerted much
greater effort, presumably because they faced stronger incentives:
they were 12 percentage points more likely to be found in class teaching
during unannounced spot checks than civil-service teachers in comparison schools, and 28 percentage points more likely to be present than
civil service teachers in the schools they were assigned to. In turn, students assigned to them also performed better at endline than those
assigned to the civil service teachers, although this does not uniquely
identify an incentive effect, since this could also be due to their different
characteristics (in particular, they had much less experience) and the
fact that they taught a single group of children.
In addition to reducing effort, civil-service teachers captured some of
the benefits of the program for their extended family — about a third of
the contract teachers hired through the program were relatives of
existing civil-service teachers in the school, and students of these
teachers appear to have learned less than students of other contract
teachers.
However, capture by teachers and their network was reduced by
promoting parental involvement and control at the local level. Point estimates suggest that the SBM empowerment program cut by half both
the reduction in the regular teacher effort in response to the program
and the fraction of contract teachers who were relatives of regular
teachers. Moreover, it eliminated the test score differential associated
with relatives of civil-service teachers.
Finally, contract teachers whose students scored well were
more likely to be hired as civil servants, creating a dynamic that
could potentially improve the quality of the teacher workforce (as
in Gordon et al., 2006). A calibration exercise suggests that if
teachers started their careers by working for three years on contract for schools whose committee received SBM training and
then were hired into the civil-service according to the process observed
over the duration of our study, the steady state gain in test scores for the
Kenyan education system as a whole would be up to 18% of a standard
deviation.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background on central government and local community
1 Das et al. (2013) find similarly that the impact of centrally provided resources (in their
case school inputs) is mediated by parents' response (who buy less inputs in response to
the program). More generally, Alatas et al. (2013) document elite capture of a government
program by officials (but not by informal elite) though they show that the welfare effects
are modest.

institutions for school governance in Kenya. Section 3 describes the
Extra Teacher Program, the experimental design, and the data.
Section 4 presents the impact of the program on test scores and teacher
behavior, as well as evidence on how school committees select contract
teachers. Section 5 discusses the potential dynamic impact of contract
teacher hiring on the teacher workforce, based on evidence about how
contract teachers' performance affects their likelihood of being hired
as civil-service teachers. Section 6 draws conclusions and discusses evidence on related programs.
2. Education governance in Kenya
Many developing countries adopted highly centralized education
systems at much lower levels of development than did some of today's
developed countries. Newly independent states adopted central control
in part to rapidly expand education levels from a low base and in part as
an element in nation-building, designed to unify diverse segments of
society. Civil-service rules were seen as an important bulwark against
politicization, ethnic favoritism, and nepotism in hiring and in favor of
professionalism.
Kenya has had an evolving mixture of local, informal education
governance and governance by the central state, but over time the
role of the central state has grown, while that of local institutions has
shrunk. During the colonial period (1895 to 1964), churches and local
communities started many independent schools. While the Harambee
movement3 in the late 60s and 70s encouraged local communities to
fundraise locally to start schools and retain representation of parents,
the local community, and institutional sponsors (in particular the local
churches) on school committees, overall the post-independence government adopted a fairly centralized education system. Civil-service
headmasters and teachers were sent to take over successful Harambee
schools and school committees were de facto relegated to fundraising
rather than teacher governance. The Ministry of Education sought to
professionalize and standardize teacher training, hiring, and discipline.
A strong teachers' union strengthened the emphasis on formal educational qualifications and on accountability to professional norms rather
than to local parents.
2.1. TSC and PTA teachers
Historically, Kenyan schools have had two types of teachers:
those hired as civil servants through the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) of the Ministry of Education, and Parent–Teacher Association (PTA) teachers hired locally and informally by local school
committees.
TSC teachers have long constituted the vast majority of teachers, but
graduates of teacher training colleges typically have to queue for TSC
jobs, often undergoing years of unemployment or short-term employment as PTA teachers before they are hired by the TSC. Once they are
hired, promotions, transfers, and disciplinary measures are decided
through the TSC and based heavily on formal, objective criteria, such
as educational qualifications and experience. TSC teachers are represented by a strong union, have civil-service protection, and the long
queue of qualified teachers waiting to be hired reflect the fact that
they receive a packet of wages and benefits considerably above most
private sector options for college graduates. Disciplinary issues are addressed by the TSC through formal legalistic procedures with adjudication by panels dominated by professional educators. The national
political system in Kenya may not have produced particularly strong
TSC teacher accountability, as there were arguably stronger political incentives for Ministers of Education to devote effort to delivering resources to their home areas or to areas of allies in national politics
than to press for increased teacher accountability at the national
level.
PTA teachers are hired by school committees at each school, using
funds raised from all parents. While all parents are formally members of the PTA, school committees are much smaller, and primarily
composed of parent representatives, elected for each class. School
committees also include some additional ex officio members, including the headmaster or a member appointed by the founding church.
There is considerable variance in the de facto relative strength of the
headmaster and parents in the school committee. Some school committees are dominated by the headmaster, but in others parents or
other community members play a very influential role. Hiring and
supervision of PTA teachers is quite informal, with much left to the
discretion of the school committee or headmaster. Parents presumably have an incentive to select good teachers for their children
and to incentivize them to teach, but school committee members
may have other incentives (such as hiring relatives). Kremer et al.
(2003) argue that the system by which school committee members
are chosen may have led school committees to prefer higher school
fees and school committee budgets than the typical parent would
have preferred.
PTA teachers are typically paid much less than their TSC counterparts. In the area of study, in 2004, the few PTA teachers we found remaining in schools, who are typically just as qualified as the regular
teachers, received compensation in the range of 2000 Kenyan shillings,
or US$ 25 per month. In comparison, the average civil service teacher
received around US$ 120 per month plus benefits, including housing
allowances, provisions for retirement, and medical coverage (Glewwe
et al., 2010). PTA teachers are effectively at will employees of the school
committee. Despite the low pay and lack of job security, PTA positions
are actively sought after by unemployed teachers, in part because
teaching experience helps them obtain a formal civil-service teaching
position.
2.2. Free primary education and local governance
Kenya's historical pattern of school committees supplementing
TSC teachers with locally-hired teachers paid from school fees was
fundamentally transformed by the introduction of free primary education in 2003. Enrollment rose nearly 30% after the abolition of
school fees. At the same time, since parents were no longer required
to pay fees, local school committees were generally unable to raise
the funds necessary to hire PTA teachers. They received grants from
the central government, but the grants had to be spent on physical
inputs, not hiring teachers locally, so de facto the introduction of
free primary education strengthened the role of the central ministries in teacher governance at the expense of parents and local elites.
A survey we conducted with over 300 primary schools in 2004
showed that 80% had no locally-hired teachers. As a result of increased
enrollment and decreased number of teachers, average class size in first
grade in 2005 was 83, and median class size was 74; 28% of grade 1
classes had more than 100 pupils.4
3. The extra teacher program and study design
3.1. Program description
3.1.1. Extra Teacher Program
The Extra Teacher Program (ETP) was implemented in 2005 and
2006 in Kenya's Western Province, and provided funds to school committees to hire one extra teacher, a “contract teacher”, to supplement TSC teachers teaching in lower grades. The program was
3 As per Wilson (1992), “The term Harambee has come to mean the provision of goods,
usually social infrastructure, through the voluntary cooperation of members of the
community.”
4 Many parents exited the public system, turning to informal private schools, which
have grown dramatically since the introduction of free primary education (Lucas and
Mbiti, 2011).
94 E. Duflo et al. / Journal of Public Economics 123 (2015) 92–110
implemented by the non-governmental organization International
Child Support (ICS), with funding from the World Bank, in a random
subset of schools in three districts of Western Kenya. ICS staff met
with the headmaster, the civil-service teachers assigned to the
lower grades, and the parents of students in grade 1 to explain
how the program worked and ask if they wanted to participate. To
qualify for ICS funding, the contract teacher hired under the ETP
contract had to have the same academic qualifications as civilservice teachers, and schools participating in the program had to
create an additional section in first grade. Students and the contract
teacher were then randomly allocated across sections. (The randomization was carried out by ICS staff in the office, with support
from the research team and was adhered to in the field.) Other inputs,
such as classroom facilities, were also supposed to be equally allocated
across sections.5
If the contract teacher hired under ETP left the school (to take on a
TSC position, or for any other reason, including dismissal by the school
committee), the school was encouraged to replace her as quickly as
possible.
Contract teachers followed the same curriculum as TSC teachers,
but they focused on a specific class (one of the sections in first
grade), in contrast to TSC teachers who most often focus on a particular subject and rotate across sections and grades. In addition to its
potential pedagogical benefits, this setup mirrored the organization
of school committees and made it easier for parents to hold teachers
accountable. For example, if a parent learned that their child spent a
lot of the day unsupervised, they would know who is responsible if a
single teacher is assigned to the class. When the program continued
the following school year, school committees were free to replace or
keep the contract teacher, but they were asked to assign the teacher
to the second grade with the students from that same group who had
been promoted.6
The monthly allowance for contract teachers was 2500 Kenyan
shillings (around US$35), putting it at the top of the range of what
is typically paid to locally-hired contract teachers by school committees in Kenya, but at only one quarter of the typical TSC teachers' salaries, and a smaller fraction of their compensation, since civil-service
teachers also receive benefits including pensions and housing
allowances.
The Extra Teacher Program represents a shift in the balance between
local parent control and formal and centralized professional control but
it should be seen as augmenting, rather than replacing, the role of the
central state. Likewise, it does not replace the current system where
teachers have tenure, but rather augments it with a probationary period. Eligibility for the program was restricted to graduates of teacher
training colleges, and contract teachers reported to centrally appointed
headmasters. As mentioned above, headmasters typically have considerable influence within school committees. Contract teachers hired
under ETP were likely motivated in part by the prospect that they
would eventually obtain civil-service jobs, and performance in previous
teaching positions is one of the criteria used by the TSC when making
appointments.
3.1.2. School-Based Management Training (SBM)
The School-Based Management (SBM) training, implemented by a
trained ICS officer in a random subset of ETP schools, was designed to
empower school committee members (in particular, the parents, as opposed to only the headmaster) to monitor the school's implementation
of the ETP program. The training lasted about 90 min, and immediately
followed the meeting that ICS held with parents to inform them of the
Extra Teacher Program. During the training, school committee members
were encouraged to supervise the recruiting of the contract teacher,
taught how to conduct interviews, and taught techniques for soliciting
input from other parents and checking teacher attendance. 7 Two parents on the school committee were asked to volunteer to perform attendance checks on the teachers on a regular basis, and were given a
notebook to record attendance. A formal sub-committee of first grade
parents was formed to evaluate the contract teacher and deliver a performance report at the end of the first year. They were also put in charge
of checking that the extra teachers focused on the duties as per their
contract (i.e. teaching one section of first grade in the first year) and
were not put to other uses in the school (i.e. replacing other teachers).
Finally, in SBM schools the school committees were told that they
should plan to hold a formal review meeting at the end of the first
school year of the program to assess the contract teacher's performance and decide whether to renew the teacher's contract or replace
the teacher. All SBM schools were visited by an ICS officer around
that time and reminded to schedule a meeting, which was to the extent possible attended by an ICS officer. Finally, all parents were informed that the school committee was receiving SBM training.8
3.1.3. Tracking
A separate set of schools were chosen for an alternative Extra Teacher Program. In those schools, the first-grade class was divided into two
sections by initial achievement (“tracking”), and the ETP contract teacher was randomly assigned to one of these sections. This program is
discussed in a different paper (Duflo et al., 2011) and, since the pedagogy and classroom organizations changed significantly in those schools,
data for the schools participating in that program is not part of the sample analyzed in this paper.
3.2. Experimental design
Background data on enrollment, pupil–teacher ratios, and number of grade 1 sections was collected in 2004 from 210 primary
schools in Western Province (these schools were already involved
with ICS for another randomized controlled trial (RCT) concerning
HIV prevention among upper grades). The 210 schools were randomly divided into a comparison group (70 schools), and an Extra
Teacher Program (ETP) group (140 schools). Of these 140 schools, 70
were randomly assigned to the tracking program and are not the
focus of this paper. Finally, thirty four of the 70 non-tracking ETP
schools (and 36 of the 70 tracking schools) were randomly selected to
participate in SBM training.
The non-evenness in the fraction sampled for SBM is by random
chance due to the stratification by district. At the time we randomized the 210 schools into ETP vs. control, we stratified by administrative division (7 in total), by whether the school was above or below
the sample median in terms of its performance at the 2001 primary
school exit exam (the KCPE), and by the treatment status (4 in
total) of the school in the prior RCT that ICS had conducted with
5 In practice, established civil-service teachers may have pulled rank and obtained better physical classroom infrastructure. We do not have data to estimate how common this
was, but in any case, it would tend to bias downwards estimates of the contract teacher
effect and bias upwards estimates of the effectiveness of class-size reductions.
6 Students enrolled in grade 2 in 2005 and who repeated grade 2 in 2006 were randomly assigned to either the contract teacher or the civil service teachers in 2006.
7 This training took place before students had been randomized into the class taught by
the contract teacher or a regular class.
8 Specifically, grade 1 parents in SBM schools were told during the general ETP introduction meeting: “The program will be on for Terms 2 and 3 of this year, and again next
year. This is a great opportunity for the children to benefit from smaller class size. For
the pupils to fully benefit, it is very crucial, however, that the ETP teacher you hire is committed, hard-working and comes to school every day. To help your school choose the best
candidate, we will have a small training session with the School Committee members at
the end of this meeting. We will also train the School Committee members on how to
monitor the teacher. But you, as parents, also have a role to play. If you feel like the ETP
teacher is not dedicated enough, for instance if he is absent too often, you should talk to
the School Committee members and ask for the ETP Teacher to be replaced. At the end
of the year, we will organize a review meeting where the school community will assess
the performance of the ETP teacher and decide whether to renew the contract or look
for a new teacher.”
E. Duflo et al. / Journal of Public Economics 123 (2015) 92–110 95
the sample of schools. Thus we had 7 × 2 × 4 = 48 strata with 4–5
schools each (not all administrative divisions have the same size).
To randomize the 140 ETP schools into tracking vs. non-tracking,
we stratified the schools by administrative district (2 in total), by
whether the school was above or below the sample median 2001
KCPE, and by whether the school was above or below the sample median in terms of grade 1 enrollment in 2004. Finally, to randomize the
140 ETP schools into SBM or no SBM, we stratified the schools by administrative district (2 in total), by whether the school was above or
below the sample median 2001 KCPE, and by whether the school had
been sampled for tracking or non-tracking.
ICS held school meetings to explain the program to parents and
teachers in March 2005. These meetings were held in all schools, including those sampled for the control group, as parental consent to test their
children had to be sought from all schools. All schools offered the opportunity to participate in the ETP and SBM programs chose to do so. After
they had hired a teacher, schools were informed that students would be
randomly assigned to join the contract teacher section. All schools
agreed. All but two of the 70 schools selected for the non-tracking
Extra Teacher Program had a contract teacher in place by early May
2005, the start of the second of the three school terms in Kenya's
academic year.
Panels A and B of Table 1 present summary statistics at the school
level. Unsurprisingly given the randomized assignment of schools to
treatment arms, Panel A shows no significant differences in observable
characteristics at baseline. Panel B suggests that the program was successful at reducing pupil–teacher ratios over two years. While average
class size in grade 1 in 2005 in the comparison schools was 82, it was
only 42-44 in ETP schools.9 This class size gap was somewhat attenuated
the following year in second grade: in 2006, average class size in second
grade was 68 in comparison schools and 41 in ETP schools. The class size
gap fell over time because students assigned to the contract teacher in
ETP schools were much more likely to be promoted to grade 2 than students in comparison schools (consistent with their better performance,
which we discuss in Section 4).10
Interestingly, a number of ETP schools decided that the students
not assigned to the contract teacher would also be assigned to one
exclusive TSC teacher: the likelihood of class-based rather than
subject-based assignment of TSC teachers was 18% in ETP schools
compared to only 5% in control schools. Although this is not random,
we note that we see no statistically significant difference in test
scores of students taught by a single TSC teacher and students taught
by rotating TSC teachers.
3.3. Study sample
Summary statistics on the students and teachers in the study are
shown in Panel C of Table 1. The student sampling frame is the cohort
of approximately 13,500 children enrolled in first grade at the end of
the first school term of 2005. Students averaged 7.7 years old at the outset of the program (with a standard deviation of 0.5 years), but ages
ranged from 5 to 14. School-maintained data on students' initial grades
was collected from the school records at the onset of the study. This
baseline performance data cannot be used to compare absolute performance between two students in different schools, since each school
may have its own level of difficulty or grading scale, but it can be used
to compare students within school. We can thus check that the random
assignment of grade 1 students to sections within a given school indeed
generated balanced sections — and we find that this is the case (Panel C
of Table 1). We will also use this data later to estimate the treatment effects separately for those performing really well or really poorly within
their school, as well as to compare the characteristics of attritors and
non-attritors (and statistically control for any imbalance among
them). Note that there is a clear correlation between baseline position in one's class according to these grades and our endline test
(0.46), which suggests that the baseline grade data has informational
content.
A total of 754 teachers taught lessons in first grade in 2005, in second
grade in 2006, or both. Of those, 653 were centrally hired civil-service
teachers, while 101 contract teachers were hired through the program
by the 70 ETP schools over the five school terms (corresponding to 15
months of instruction) it operated. Average age was 42 for civilservice teachers and 27 for contract teachers, and contract teachers
had 14 fewer years of experience than their TSC counterparts on average. Contract teachers were also much less likely to be females than
TSC teachers in our sample (49% versus 66%). This is in part due to the
fact that TSC teachers in our sample are those assigned to lower grades,
and female teachers are disproportionately assigned to lower grades.
The share of females in the entire TSC teacher body is on average 55%
in our sample of schools, statistically indistinguishable from the percentage among contract teachers.
3.4. Data
3.4.1. Student participation, teacher effort and pedagogy
Over the course of the program, five unannounced visits were made
to each school by the research team. Student presence in class was measured at all of them, and teacher effort was measured at four of the five
visits. Teacher effort was measured by the teacher's presence in school
and by whether she was in any classroom teaching (not just grade
1) when the observers entered the school compound.
During these unannounced school visits, we also verified whether
the students were in their assigned section. Students typically attended
their assigned section when both teachers were present, but when
teachers were absent, sections were sometimes combined. On average
across all visits, 94% of students were found in their assigned section,
conditional on the two sections being taught separately. Sections were
found pooled in 10.7% of visits.
Data on pedagogy was collected through classroom observations
and structured interviews with teachers. The pedagogy data was collected in the first term of 2006 (year 2 of the program), and focused
on grade 2 teaching. In each school, one TSC teacher was chosen to be
surveyed and observed (while teaching grade 2 students). In ETP
schools, the ETP contract teacher was also surveyed and observed
while teaching grade 2 students.11
3.4.2. Test scores
Standardized tests covering math and literacy questions ranging
from identifying numbers and letters to subtracting two-digit numbers
and writing words were administered in all schools after 5 school terms
(19 months total, but only 15 months of instruction), just before the
program ended (November 2006). The same tests were administered
again during a follow-up one year after the program ended (November
2007). Tests were administered by trained enumerators and graded
blindly by a separate team of enumerators. In each school, 60 students
were randomly drawn from the baseline sample to participate in the
tests, for a total of around 8000 students across all schools.
9 Class size did not fall by exactly 50% since some schools already had two grade 1 sections at baseline. In these schools, the introduction of the Extra Teacher Program reduced
class size by only one third.
10 The repetition rate is relatively high in Kenya. In year 2 of the program, the population
in grade 2 thus included both those sampled students who had been promoted and did not
transfer to another school, and grade 2 repeaters.
11 The TSC teacher was selected as follows. Among grade 2 classes not taught by the ETP
teacher, one class was selected at random. We then attempted to observe the TSC teacher
teaching English to that class. If that teacher was not available or not teaching at the time
of the visit, we tried to observe the Math, Swahili and Science teachers, in decreasing order
of priority. Sometimes a teacher teaches multiple topics. The distribution of subjects observed in class was English 30%, Math 41%, Swahili 19%, and this is comparable between
ETP and TSC teachers.
96 E. Duflo et al. / Journal of Public Economics 123 (2015) 92–110
To limit attrition, enumerators were instructed to go to the homes of
students who had dropped out or were absent on the day of the test and
to bring them to school for the test. Not all students were found and
tested, however. Overall, the attrition rate was 18% for the endline
test, and 23% for the long-run follow-up test.12 While this level of attrition is higher than what we would have wished, it is in the common
range for education studies in developing countries (attrition was
20.4% in year 2 in Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2013) and 22%
after only a year in Duflo et al. (2012)). We discuss the patterns of attrition and their implications for the estimation of the treatment effects in
the Results section.
3.4.3. Hiring, retention, and regularization of contract teachers
In the school term that followed the start of the program, data
was collected on the contract teachers hired through the program,
including their demographic characteristics, past experience, relationship to the school (i.e., whether they are related to a current
teacher or born locally), and the hiring process. Unfortunately this
data is missing for two ETP teachers, thus tables using this data
have only 68 observations instead of 70. Demographic data was
also collected on civil-service teachers. In the school term that
followed the end of the program, headmasters of program schools
were interviewed about the status of the contract teacher, and
whether the school committee had taken over the ETP program
after the ICS subsidy ended.
4. Results
This section first estimates the program impacts on student attendance, attrition and pupil test scores (Section 4.1). To understand the
mechanisms behind these results, we study impacts on teacher behavior (Section 4.2), and then study how the SBM program affected teacher
selection and behavior (Section 4.3).
4.1. Learning outcomes
Recall that we have two layers of randomization: schools were
randomly assigned to programs, and within schools students were
randomly assigned to teachers. To simplify the analysis, we first
analyze the overall program effect at the school level, comparing averages across school types. Specifically, we use the following reduced
12 School choice is not a concern in our context.We observe quasi inexistent levels of student sorting across treatment and control schools during the experiment. In any case we
conduct an intention-to-treat analysis, assigning treatment status based on the school
the students were enrolled in prior to the program being announced.

a Under “class-based assignment” of teachers, each teacher is assigned a specific class for which she teaches all subjects (math, reading, etc.). Under “subject-based assignment” of
teachers, each teacher is assigned a specific subset of subjects and teaches those subjects in multiple classes and/or grades. b Baseline scores come from tests administered by schools prior to the program and are not comparable across schools; they are normalized such that the mean score in each school is
zero and the standard deviation is one.

on student outcomes:

where Yij is the outcome of student i in school j (when the outcome

We then allow for the program effects to depend on the type of
teacher a student was assigned to. Namely, we estimate the following
equation:
Yi j ¼ b1 BasicETP TSCi; j þ b2 BasicETP CTi; j þ b3ETPwSBM TSCi; j

class taught by the contract teacher in a school that received basic
ETP, ETPwSBM_TSCi,j is a dummy equal to 1 if student i was assigned to
a class taught by TSC teachers in a school that received ETP with SBM,
and finally ETPwSBM_CTi,j is a dummy equal to 1 if student i was
assigned to the class taught by the contract teacher in a school that received ETP with SBM.
We present results on student attendance, attrition and endline test
scores in Table 2. Panel A presents estimations of Eq. (1) and Panel B
presents estimations of Eq. (2).
In column 1 of Table 2 Panel A, a1 is the average effect on student
attendance of being in a school sampled for the basic ETP program.
Compared to the mean attendance rate in the comparison schools
(85.6%, shown at the bottom of the panel), the estimated effect of
the basic ETP program is very small and insignificant (0.002). The
ETP + SBM program (coefficient a2) has a somewhat larger, positive
effect on attendance (+2.1 percentage points, p-value = 0.098).
When we breakdown the effect by teacher type in panel B, we find
that only students of contract teachers in SBM schools were significantly more likely to attend. As will be discussed in Table 3 below, this
mirrors the higher effort rate we observed among contract teachers in
SBM schools.
The next column in Table 2 presents estimates of attrition at the
endline test. Attrition was lower in SBM schools, consistent with
the higher attendance rate observed in those schools. Attrition is
also lower among students of contract teachers, which is again consistent with the attendance pattern of students, and with the
higher effort observed among contract teachers, which we will discuss later. To the extent that attrition is driven at least in part by
low school attachment (students who have either completely
dropped out or are absent often), the reduction in attrition is itself
an important outcome, and indication that those two programs
were successful. However, they potentially confound the test
score results.
To investigate this pattern more deeply, Table A1 shows the attrition
results separately for students initially in the bottom and top half of the
test scores distribution. Overall, the attrition pattern in ETP and ETP
with SBM schools is similar for high and low achievement student.
However, low achievement students assigned to TSC teachers in SBM
schools were less likely to attrit than those in the control group, and
high achievement students assigned to the contract teacher in SBM
schools were less likely to attrit than those in the control group. This
may bias any estimated effect of being assigned to the contract teacher
in SBM schools upwards and any effect of being assigned to the TSC
teachers in SBM schools downwards. To address this problem, we do
two things: First, we implement DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux's (hereafter DFL) reweighting scheme, using the baseline data to group students
by quintile in their school, and reweighting (within each region) so that
the distribution of students baseline scores those who took the endline
test resembles that of all students (DiNardo et al., 1996). These results
are presented in the last three columns of Table 2. Second, we present
non-parametric Manski-Lee bounds (Lee, 2008), in Table A4.
In Eq. (1) estimated in columns 3–5 of Table 2 Panel A, a1 is the
average effect on test scores of being in a school sampled for the
basic ETP program. The effect on test scores of the basic ETP program
is 0.14, not quite significant, with a standard error of 0.098 (p-value
— 0.112). The coefficient estimate a2 is the average effect of being in
a school sampled for the ETP with SBM program. The effect is larger,
an increase of 0.196 standard deviation, significant at the 5% level.
We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the impacts of the two
programs was the same, however (see the p-value for the test that
a1 = a2 at the bottom of Panel A, at 0.63). The gains were stronger
in math than literacy (columns 4 and 5 of Table 2). The results are
robust to including a linear trend in test scores date, shown in
Table A2 (there is a small imbalance in test score dates by group)
and also robust to including school-level and student-level controls,
shown in Table A3.
Fig. 1 and panel B of Table 2 break down the program effects by
teacher type. Focusing first on the TSC vs. contract teachers split,
Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the endline test scores for three
groups: students in the comparison schools, students assigned to
TSC teachers in ETP schools (whether Basic or SBM) and students
assigned to the ETP contract teacher in ETP Schools. The three
distributions are clearly distinct from each other. The performance
of students assigned to contract teachers strictly dominates that of
students assigned to TSC teachers within ETP schools, and these latter students themselves perform strictly better than those in control
schools.
Turning now to the effect by teacher and program type, coefficient b1 in panel B of Table 2 is the effect of the basic ETP program
for students assigned to the TSC teachers. Absent any endogenous
response of teachers, this would mainly capture the effect of a reduced class size in the schools that were provided additional teaching staff. The effect is relatively small (0.043 of a standard
deviation) and insignificantly different from zero (standard error:
0.102). In contrast, the effect of the basic ETP program on students
assigned to the contract teacher is three times as large, at 0.244
13 An alternative specification of the endline test score for math, using item response
theory, yields similar results (available from the authors). The format of the language score
was not appropriate for this exercise. Fig. 1. Distribution of endline test scores, by school and teacher types.
98 E. Duflo et al. / Journal of Public Economics 123 (2015) 92–110
standard deviation (coefficient b2, standard error: 0.107). We can
reject at the 1% level equality of the effect of the basic ETP program
between those assigned to TSC teachers and those assigned to contract teachers (see p-value for the test b1 = b2 at the bottom of the
table).
The gap between students of TSC vs. contract teachers is considerably smaller when the ETP program is implemented jointly with SBM.
In SBM schools, coefficient estimates b3 (for students assigned to TSC
teachers) and b4 (for students assigned to ETP contract teachers) are
both large and significant, and we cannot reject that they are equal to
each other. Ultimately, the ETP with SBM program appears to yield
large gains in test scores for all students, while the Basic ETP program
only benefited students assigned to the contract teachers. Thus the
very cheap SBM intervention appears to increase the effectiveness of
the Extra Teacher Program.14
The last three columns in Table 2 show the test score results after reweighting to account for differential attrition. The results are virtually
identical, suggesting the effects are unlikely to be driven by potential
biases caused by attrition (as mentioned above there is a strong
correlation between baseline test scores and endline scores, so the reweighting would make a difference if differential unobserved ability
was a concern).
Finally, Table A4 shows the estimated lower bounds for these specifications accounting for attrition, using the approach first proposed in
Lee (2008).
15 Here again, the relative performance of the programs
and their effects by teacher type appear relatively robust to controlling
for attrition, though most of the conservative lower bounds we estimate
are insignificant at conventional levels. The one result that remains consistently significant at conventional levels is the finding that contract
teachers led to large and significant improvements in math scores,
both when compared to control school students and to students
assigned to TSC teachers within basic ETP schools. This is quite notable,
because in many cases where such analyses are presented, Lee bounds
are so wide that most results become insignificant at the lower bound.
While we see relatively large learning effects in the years contract
teachers are present, these effects appear to fade out once students
are reassigned to regular classes. One year after the program ended
and students had gone back to being taught by rotating civil service
14 For completeness, it should be noted that, while we find positive and at times statistically significant effects of SBM training on test scores in the context of the main Extra
Teacher Program, the estimated effects were smaller and not statistically significant in
the tracking program (results are available upon request). This may merely reflect the
more limited scope for improvement under that program: the tracking program itself mitigated the endogenous TSC teacher effort response (at least in the top track), thus leaving
little scope to further increase effort and test scores.
15 The method amounts to the following: for each treatment group, we identify the “attrition deficit” (e.g., the excess proportion of students who did not attrit compared to the
comparison group), and then “trimming” the upper tail of the test score distribution by
this proportion, yielding a worst-case scenario bound. To refine the bound, we use two
baseline covariates (gender and age above/below median) and, within each treatment
group, use different trimming proportions for each gender–age category. The trimming
proportions are shown in Table A4 columns 4, 8 and 12.

Notes: column 1: linear probability model regressions. Data comes from five unannounced spot checks performed by the research team (two in 2005 and three in 2006). Students identified as dropouts are coded as absent. Those reported to have moved to another school are excluded from the analysis. Columns 2–8: OLS regressions. The endline test was administered
after the program had been in place for five school terms. In each school, 60 students were randomly drawn from the baseline sample to participate in the tests. Scores are normalized such
that the mean and standard deviation of the comparison group are zero and one, respectively. Columns 6–8 reweigh the observations by the inverse of the non-attrition rate in their quintile of the initial performance distribution.
In both panels the omitted category is the comparison group. Panel A: “basic ETP” is a dummy equal to 1 if the school was sampled for the basic ETP program. The coefficient on this dummy
provides the average effect of the basic ETP program on students. “ETP + SBM” is a dummy equal to 1 if the school was sampled for the ETP program with the SBM training. Panel B: “basic
ETP, assigned to TSC teacher” is a dummy equal to 1 if the school was sampled for the basic ETP program and the student was assigned to the TSC teacher. The coefficient on this dummy
provides the average effect of the Basic ETP program on students assigned to TSC teachers.
All regressions control for region dummies. Robust standard errors are clustered at the school level in parentheses. ***, **, * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels respectively.
Columns 2–8: there are only 139 schools/clusters because tests could not be administered in one of the ETP schools.

teachers in large classes, the effects were no longer statistically significant, and some have completely disappeared (Table A5). Such fadeout is not out of line with the decay in test scores observed for other
early interventions, including India (e.g. Banerjee et al., 2007) and the
US (see Cascio and Staiger, 2012, for a review), and with rates of fade
out estimated in developing countries (Andrabi et al., 2011 find that
only a fifth to a half of learning persists between grades). However, it
contrasts with the more persistent effects of tracking that we observed
in the same context (Duflo et al., 2011). Of course, the decay in test score
effects does not necessarily imply a lack of long-term impacts (Chetty
et al., 2010), though it very well may.16
16 At the post-secondary level, evidence from Carrell and West (2010) suggests shortterm positive test score effects can be driven by changes in teaching style that hurt students as they advance to a more challenging material. To the extent that we focus on
second-graders and whether they acquired very basic skills without which further learning would be difficult, the potential for negative long-term effects seems low but we can
only speculate.

Interestingly, the fact that the achievement results faded out,
even though attrition patterns are similar across the endline and
long-run follow-up surveys (see Table A1), suggests that the endline
achievement impacts shown in Table 2 are unlikely to be entirely
due to differential selection. If they were, then as the differential
attrition persisted, the achievement effects would likely also have
persisted.17
4.2. Teacher effort and pedagogy
To understand the mechanisms behind these results, Table 3
presents evidence on teacher effort and on pedagogy using data from
unannounced spot checks, classroom observations conducted with a
subset of teachers, and surveys administered to teachers. For this analysis
we consider five types of teachers: TSC teachers in comparison schools;
TSC teachers in Basic ETP program schools; TSC teachers in ETP with
SBM schools; contract teachers in Basic ETP program schools; and contract teachers in ETP with SBM schools. We regress a battery of teacher
effort and pedagogy variables on dummies for each teacher type —
the omitted category being the first, TSC teachers in comparison
schools. Thus the coefficient estimates shown in Table 3 presents the
average performance of a teacher of a given type compared to TSC
teachers in comparison schools.
We find striking differences across school and teacher types. Focusing first on effort (Panel A), we find that contract teachers in Basic ETP
schools were 11.7 percentage points more likely to be found teaching
in a classroom (any classroom — not specifically grade 1) during a random visit than TSC teachers in comparison schools (the mean for the
TSC teachers in the comparison group was 57.9%, see bottom of Panel
A, column 1). In contrast, TSC teachers in Basic ETP schools were 15.7
percentage points less likely to be found in class teaching during a
school visit than their counterparts in comparison schools (coefficient
b1). This effect corresponds to a 27% decrease in teacher presence in
class compared to comparison schools. This suggests that TSC teachers
took advantage of the presence of the contract teachers to work less.
Contract teachers might not have been in a position to refuse teaching
combined classes when TSC teachers were absent.
However, there is evidence that this reduction in effort by TSC
teachers was mitigated through community empowerment. In ETP
with SBM schools, the decrease in attendance among TSC teachers
is only around half that observed in Basic ETP schools (−8.3 pp vs.
−15.7 pp, p-value of the difference = 0.081). Thus, it seems that
the SBM program was partly effective in ensuring that the extra resources were put to their intended use, rather than captured by the
incumbents.
The SBM program did not affect TSC teachers' presence on the
school compound, but increased the likelihood that teachers were
in class teaching if present (Table 3, columns 2 and 3). While
teachers who are present but not teaching might sometimes be grading or performing some other duty for the school, most often our
monitors reported finding teachers drinking tea with other teachers
or reading a newspaper, and therefore we are confident that the increase in classroom time we observe among TSC teachers in the
SBM schools corresponds to an increase in effort, not to a reallocation
of total effort towards teaching effort.18 Note that it is easier for parents to observe and enforce along this margin (and perhaps also less
costly for teachers). That is because teachers who are absent from
the school compound might claim that their absence was workrelated (e.g., in-service training, proctoring, committee work), and
parents would not be able to verify such claims without the assistance of the headmaster.
The gap in effort between TSC and contract teachers remained
large in SBM schools however, with TSC teachers almost 30 percentage points less likely to be found teaching (0.083 + 0.206). Given the
results in Table 2, showing no difference in the scores of their
students, this implies that TSC teachers, when they teach, can be
very efficient teachers.
Besides teacher effort, the ETP and SBM programs could have led to
changes in pedagogy. This was not the aim of the SBM program, but it is
possible it indirectly affected teachers' commitment to the students. For
the ETP program, pedagogy may have changed because it made the class
smaller. Moreover, the pedagogy adopted by contract teachers could
systematically differ from that of TSC teachers, given their focus on a
single class, or the fact that contract teachers were typically younger
(and thus more energetic and trained more recently, but also less experienced). To test this, Panels B and C of Table 3 present estimates of program impacts, by school and teacher type, on pedagogy, measured
through direct observation of lessons and structured interviews with
teachers about classroom processes. Overall, we find only modest evidence that the ETP program changed pedagogy, and no pedagogy effect
of SBM whatsoever. The absolute number of students called to the
blackboard and called on to answer questions somewhat increased in
both types of ETP schools (the effects are large in magnitude compared
to the base, but most are not statistically significant; see Panel B). Since
class size was reduced by close to half, the rate at which any given student was called increased, without the teachers having to change their
pedagogy. The number of students who asked questions decreased
more than proportionally than the class size reduction, possibly because teachers were able to address issues before they arose. Indeed
in ETP schools teachers (whether civil servants or contract teachers)
report having more time to provide individual attention to children,
including slow learners, and provide feedback on individual work
(Panel C).19
Our results should be interpreted as the impact of supplementing a
civil service system with locally-hired contract teachers brought in on
a probationary basis, with the expectation of eventually obtaining a
civil-service position, not as the impact of replacing a civil service teacher system with a system based entirely on local hiring of contract
teachers. The contract teachers we study likely worked hard in part because they believed this would help them obtain a civil-service position:
as we will show in Section 5 below, about half of the contract teachers in
our study eventually obtained civil-service positions by the end of our
study period, with better-performing teachers more likely to obtain
these positions.20
4.3. Selection and retention of contract teachers: teacher rent seeking and
parents' empowerment
The results above suggest that TSC teachers responded to the ETP
program by reducing effort, thus capturing some of the benefits of the
program for themselves. In this section, we show that TSC teachers
also captured some of the benefits of the program for their extended
family, by securing the contract teacher positions for relatives.21 And
we provide evidence that the SBM program, just as it mitigated the
17 We thank an anonymous referee for making that point. 18 Recall that we observe whether the teacher was teaching in any class, not just grade 1.
So our measure would capture re-allocation to other grades. Conditional on not being
found in class teaching, TSC teachers were found in the staff room 79% of the time and under a tree 21% of the time.
19 One might expect a bigger impact of moving from rotation to a system in which students are taught by a single teacher in schools where more teachers share the firstgrade class. We therefore estimated how the contract teacher effect varied with the number of civil-service teachers rotating in the non-ETP section. This test has low power, but
we do not find any indication that the contract teacher effect is greater in schools where
more teachers share classes.
20 Given these incentives, it is impossible to say what would happen if TSC teachers were
phased out and replaced by contract teachers without any prospect of tenure.
21 This finding relates to Durante et al. (2011), who find that a 1998 reform that increased autonomy by local university officials in Italy resulted, in some areas, in a significant increase in the incidence of nepotism towards relatives.
E. Duflo et al. / Journal of Public Economics 123 (2015) 92–110 101
effort response, mitigated such nepotism. This is another channel
through which empowering parents increased the effectiveness of providing additional resources to the school.
As a background, in Kenya, those with formal sector jobs often face
strong pressure from members of their extended families to help
them obtain such jobs as well. This pressure may be particularly strong
for males, because Kenya is a patrilocal society and contract teachers are
overwhelmingly hired from the local area, so a greater proportion of
male teachers will be local to the area of the school and will have
relatives from the area interested in applying for the job, while
women will have fewer obligation towards their birth family and their
husbands' relatives.22
To understand the factors influencing hiring and retention of
contract teachers it is useful to consider the following framework. PTA
hiring committees are composed of parents and teachers. In the hiring
decisions, assume that parents put relatively more weight on maximizing student performance, while teachers (particularly male teachers)
put more weight on delivering rents to their relatives. Insofar as SBM
training empowers parents, it will reduce the weight PTA committees
place on delivering rents to relatives of teachers. The idea that local beneficiaries will put more weight on the collective good and less on rent
diversion is a key motivation behind the effort to strengthen beneficiary
committees (such as school committees) (World Bank, 2004), although
some express the concern that local committees would be more likely to
try and share the rents locally than teachers who are not from the area
(Bardhan and Mokherjee, 2000, 2005). Consistent with our assumption,
however, Alatas et al. (2013) find that while formal elites to capture
rents for themselves and their relative when they are put in charge of allocating a program, informal elites (those without an official position)
are less likely to do so.
Suppose that PTA hiring committees receive applications and can
obtain observable information such as sex, education, and experience
along with an imperfect signal of teacher quality. Suppose also that
teachers can supply additional information on their relatives creating
a force leading to a potentially better selection of relatives. However,
they also have an incentive to hire relatives even if they are bad: this
is the same key trade off that employers face when using workers to
refer individuals from their social network (see, e.g., Beaman and
Magruder, 2012). Once teachers have been hired, school committees
obtain additional information on their performance and decide whether
to renew their contract and, more generally, how to manage them, and
TSC teachers may continue to deliver rents to relatives. Relatives choose
effort levels knowing this.
The combined effects of information and rent seeking on aggregate hiring of relatives and on the relative test scores of students of
relatives of existing TSC teachers are ambiguous, but this framework
suggests that SBM should unambiguously reduce hiring of teacher
relatives, particularly those hired due to rent-seeking motives.
Moreover, we might see lower effort among teachers' relatives
(due to lower incentives), but SBM should also improve this. Ceteris
paribus, this will increase the test scores among teacher relatives in
SBM schools. The overall impact of SBM on test scores of relatives is
however potentially ambiguous because of the information effect:
if teachers have valuable information about their relatives but
SBM-trained committees do not use this information, the relatives
they hire may be worse (see Fisman et al., 2014 for a discussion of
a similar tradeoff for CEOs and their boards).
We have limited power to test these predictions due to the small
sample size, but we present some evidence that is consistent with the
predictions.
4.3.1. Hiring of relatives
In ETP schools without SBM, 34% of contract teachers hired at the
onset of the program were relatives of existing TSC teachers. In SBM
schools the share of relatives among contract teachers was 15 percentage points lower, at 19% (Table 4, column 1). This difference is not statistically significant at conventional levels, however, given the limited
sample size (the p-value for the SBM effect is 0.133).
As noted, one frequent concern with local empowerment programs
is the risk of local capture: empowering parents within PTA might
merely lead to a bias towards locals, perhaps with a strong ethnic component. However, there is no evidence that the SBM program led to a
shift in favoritism from relatives of teachers to locals. On the contrary,
22 While TSC teachers are initially posted outside of their home area, they become eligible to choose their location as they gain seniority, and it is very common for seasoned TSC
teachers, especially male ones, to be in posts in their home area.

point estimates suggest SBM schools were 12 percentage points less
likely to hire contract teachers from the local area, although here
again the difference is not significant (see column 2, Table 4.) More generally, it seems that SBM training increased the transparency of the
contract-teacher recruiting process. SBM schools advertised for the position more broadly and interviewed more candidates (these results are
shown in Table A6).
Another concern is that teachers may be more influenced by professional qualifications, while parents may be influenced by cultural factors,
such as preferences for men. Point estimates suggest the possibility that
empowering local parents reduced hiring of women as contract teachers,
but here again effects are far from significant in our small sample
(Table 4, column 3).
Table 4 also shows that, as predicted, the share of women among TSC
teachers is indeed negatively correlated with the hiring of a relative.
Note that this could also be driven by omitted characteristics of schools,
themselves responsible for a lesser rate of nepotism. For example,
schools in poorer conditions may have a harder time retaining male
teachers, and in those schools the benefit associated with being a
contract teacher would be lower, reducing the incentives to secure the
position for a relative.
4.3.2. Teacher effort and student performance
The framework above suggests that teacher relatives hired under
SBM should perform better than teacher relatives hired in the
absence of SBM, both because SBM should reduce rent seeking and
thus should improve selection of teachers, and because SBM schools
may be better able to monitor and incentivize those relatives of
existing TSC teachers who are hired. The only reason why this
would not be the case is if SBM prevent information to flow effectively from teachers to the committee and this effect is sufficiently
strong to outweigh the two others.
Looking at students' test scores in column 1 of Table 5, we estimate
both the main effect of being taught by a contract teacher who is a
relative of an existing teacher, and an interaction between SBM and
this variable. We do find that relatives perform less well than nonrelatives: the point estimate of the “teacher relative” effect on test
scores is −0.355 in non-SBM schools (significant at the 10% level).
This indicates that hiring relatives must to some extent be a way to
share rents, and is inefficient from society's point of view. The SBM program entirely undoes this effect however: the interaction is +0.441
standard deviations (significant at the 5% level). Taken together, these
numbers imply that in SBM schools the total “teacher relative effect”
is statistically undistinguishable from zero, consistent with the hypothesis that SBM undoes the tendency either to select weak relatives or to
let relatives get away with low effort.
One worry with the analysis above is that schools that hired a relative may systematically differ from schools that did not, and therefore
the heterogeneity in contract teacher performance by “relative” status
may be picking up some differences across schools rather than the

specific effect of nepotism or the lack thereof. To check this, in column 2
of Table 5 we test whether the “relative” and “relative × SBM” variables
have predictive power for the performance of students assigned to
TSC teachers, and find similarly signed coefficients but of smaller
magnitudes and insignificant, although the “relative” effect is not significantly different for student assigned to TSC and ETP teacher in non-SBM
schools (p-value = 0.126, column 3).
Looking at teacher effort, the point estimates in column 4 of Table 5
suggest that while contract teachers who are relatives of TSC teachers
are less likely to be in class teaching, this tendency is mitigated by the
SBM program. Coefficients are large in magnitude and are significant
at the 10% level.
The framework also suggests that if existing TSC teachers are female, rent seeking will be lower but information channels should
still operate, leading to better performance of relatives of females.
The data are consistent with this: fewer teacher relatives were
hired in schools with a higher fraction of females among TSC
teachers in lower grades (Table 4, column 1), and students of relatives hired as contract teachers learned more in those schools
(Table 5, column 1, significant at the 5% level). Relatives hired in
these schools were also present and teaching in class significantly more
often (Table 5, column 3). Of course, as mentioned above, schools with
a higher share of female TSC teachers may be systematically different
on other dimensions than their female share, therefore here again it is difficult to interpret these effects as causal.
5. Potential dynamic effects of local probationary teacher hiring
The results presented above suggest important potential gains from
moving from a system in which teachers are immediately given tenure
and managed solely through centralized state-run institutions to a system in which teachers are initially hired locally on temporary contracts
by trained PTAs before becoming eligible for TSC positions. We estimate
it could not only save roughly 75% on teacher salaries during teachers'
initial period as locally-hired contract employees but could also significantly strengthen incentives for teachers and produce better learning
outcomes during this period.
However, the long-run impact of adding a new phase to the career of teachers in which they are hired locally on short-run contracts before obtaining civil-service positions depends not only on
the relative performance of TSC teachers and contract teachers at a
given point in time, but also on how local hiring of contract teachers affects the teacher workforce over time. In this section, we first show that
the TSC was able to identify and promote better-performing contract
teachers (among those who had been hired). We then briefly present
an (admittedly speculative) calibration of the impact of a system in
Table 6
Contract teacher retention and promotion.

which qualified teachers must first be hired by their local community on
renewable contract and only then get tenure within the TSC.
5.1. Performance-based retention
Table 6 presents evidence on how contract teachers' performance in
the ETP program affected their subsequent outcomes.23 By the beginning
of year 3, the year after the program ended, 47% of the initial contract
teachers had been hired by the TSC.24 Experience (a proxy for cohort)
was an important driver in TSC hiring. But holding experience and
school quality constant, contract teachers whose students had good
scores were more likely to be hired by the TSC. A one standard deviation
increase in the performance of students assigned to the contract teacher
increases the likelihood that the contract teacher was absorbed by the
TSC by 34 percentage points, after controlling for performance among
students of TSC teachers, and student baseline characteristics (Table 6,
column 1).25 Endline test score and prior experience are the only contract teacher characteristics that predict future hiring.
Another 19% of contract teachers left their school (for reasons other
than having obtained a TSC position) before the end of the program and
had to be replaced (Table 6, column 2). The point estimate of −0.11 for
student endline performance suggests that teachers whose students
had poor performance were more likely to leave, but the low performance of the students may have been caused by the early departure,
rather than the other way around.26
More telling is what happened at the end of the program. The funds
for the program stopped, but school committees could try to raise their
own funds to continue it. Schools with the SBM program were more
likely to retain contract teachers into year 3. While 25% of the nonSBM schools kept the contract teacher on board after the ETP program
ended, this figure was 0.25 + 0.22 = 47% among SBM schools (see
Table 6, column 3). Thus parents were close to twice as likely to pay to
continue employment of the contract teacher when they had stronger
governance rights. We cannot distinguish the direct channel of parents
being more willing to raise funds for a program because they felt
they had a greater role in governance from the indirect channel of
governance improving program performance and this in turn increasing willingness to pay.
Finally, among teachers not hired by the TSC, we see a positive but
insignificant relationship between student performance and contract
teacher retention by the school (Table 6, column 4). Relatives are not
less likely to be retained, despite worse performance, so conditional
on performance, relatives are more likely to be retained.
5.2. Long run dynamic impacts
The evidence above suggests that the TSC was able to identify and
give permanent contracts to better performing contract teachers. In
Appendix A, we do a calibration exercise and estimate, for a reasonable
set of assumptions, the potential dynamic impact of a local contract teacher hiring program embedded in an “up or out” promotion system. We estimate that if new entrants to the profession worked three years as a
contract teacher and half were subsequently hired as civil service teachers
where they remained for 27 years, then 20% of the teaching force would
be made up of contract teachers in steady state. The extra incentives for
the 20% of the workforce on temporary contract (net of the ‘novice’ effect
identified in the literature times the higher proportion of novice teachers
in steady state under such a system)27 would yield a gain of 0.05 standard
deviations in test scores; the positive selection into the TSC would yield
an increase in student scores of 0.13 standard deviations; and thus
the total learning gain from the system would be 0.18 standard deviations. This calculation is obviously quite speculative: our estimates of
the impact of the program on teacher selection are not the most precise,
the calculations rely on a number of assumptions (e.g. that teachers
serve for 27 years), the extent of capture by teachers or local elites may
differ if a probation system is formalized and scaled, and much would
clearly depend on the details of how such a system was implemented;
but it provides a useful way to think about the potential gains from
reintroducing elements of the historic system in which many teachers
were initially hired on short-term contracts by school committees and
later absorbed into the civil service.
6. Conclusion
Efforts to improve education in developing countries often focus
either on providing additional resources, typically by hiring more
teachers to bring down class size, or on governance reform. We examine such programs in Kenya, and find that they can work as complements. In the absence of parents' empowerment, the additional
resources brought about by a contract teacher program are captured
by the existing civil-service teachers in two ways. First, civil-service
teachers reduce effort, which undoes the positive impact of class size
reduction for their students. Second, they seek to capture rents by hiring
their relatives, whose students perform less well than students of other
contract teachers. Empowering parents through a short training session
mitigates both these negative effects. First, in schools with SBM
training, civil-service teachers were more likely to be present in
class and teaching; second, in those schools, relatives of civil-service
teachers were less likely to be hired as contract teachers; third, those
relatives who were hired anyway performed as well as non-relatives
(which could come from better selection of the remaining relatives, or
stronger incentives).
Our results suggest that in the presence of weak institutions, increases in resources may be undermined by the behavioral responses
of existing providers. However, local governance offers the potential to
translate increased resources into better outcomes. In particular, programs devolving authority to hire teachers on short-term contracts
have potential both to improve test scores in the short run and to improve the quality of the teaching labor force in the long run. But details
matter: small differences in program design (e.g., a few hours of SBM
training) can substantially affect outcomes.
In this light it is worth considering two related studies. A large-scale
randomized study contemporary to ours and carried out across the state
of Andhra Pradesh in India (Muralidharan and Sundararaman, 2013)
examines a program in which most contract teachers were not teacher
training college graduates and thus were not eligible to become civilservice teachers. They find average test score gains very similar to
those we observe, as well as reductions in civil-service teacher presence,
suggesting that very similar forces may be at play in a different geographic and institutional context.
Results from a study following up on ours (Bold et al., 2013), also
in Kenya, suggest that the impact of contract teacher hiring is indeed
sensitive to the institutional context and whether the program is executed as designed. A contract teacher program in which administration was contracted out to an NGO which made payments to school
committees to hire teachers yielded learning gains similar to ours. But in
23 Data on the contract teacher are missing for 2 of 70 program schools. 24 We had no contact with the TSC during the study, but we conducted interviews with
school headmasters at the end of the program, and those interviews suggest that headmasters can recommend contract teachers to the TSC hiring commission.
25 We find a positive but not significant correlation between TSC hiring and the gap in
scores between students assigned to TSC and those assigned to ETP teachers, thus it's
not clear that benchmark competition between contract teachers and existing civil service
teachers is responsible for the tendency for teachers with better scores to obtain TSC
positions.
26 School committees never explicitly voted against renewing a contract in year 2.
27 Novice teachers typically have lower value added (Kane et al., 2008; Rockoff and
Staiger, 2010).
E. Duflo et al. / Journal of Public Economics 123 (2015) 92–110 105
a variant in which payments to schools were made through the district offices of the Ministry of Education (a separate institution from the TSC,
which normally handles payments to civil-service teachers), contract
teacher positions were less likely to be filled, monthly payments to
teachers were often seriously late (the average delay was 2.33 months
and 10% of teachers waited 10 months to be paid), and the program did
not significantly improve test scores. Bold et al. (2013) show that part of
the difference is accounted for by the unfilled vacancies and the late salary
payments. Possibly more important, Bold et al. (2013) also show that contract teachers hired through the Ministry were much more likely than
those hired by the NGO to believe that they would be automatically promoted to TSC teachers at the end of their contract, which as expected seriously undermined incentives.
What are the political prospects for local hiring of contract teachers?
While teachers' unions are likely to resist efforts to reduce their
members' wages, they may be willing to compromise on a system in
which existing members are protected, but new entrants to the teaching
profession are first hired on short-term contracts at a lower pay, and
then are eventually brought in as civil-service employees (or fired, in
an up or out system akin to the higher education system in the US
(Pritchett and Murgai, 2006).
Subsequent to our study, the Kenyan government, which had long
had a freeze on hiring of new civil-service teachers, hired 18,000 contract teachers. Initial plans included no guarantee of civil-service employment afterwards. However, the Kenyan National Union of
Teachers opposed the initial plans and under the eventual agreement,
contract teachers were hired at much higher salaries than in the program we study. Hiring was done under civil-service rules heavily
weighting the cohort in which applicants graduated from teacher training college rather than the judgment of local school committees, and
contract teachers hired under the program were promised civil-service
positions. Our analysis suggests that these features likely undermined
both the incentive and selection effects of local hiring of contract
teachers by parent committees.
Appendix A. Calibrating the potential dynamic impact of contract
teachers on teacher workforce
We follow an approach similar to that of Gordon et al. (2006), who estimate that in Los Angeles, dropping the bottom quartile of teachers after
their first year of teaching would increase the average value added of
retained teachers by 1.5 percentile points. In their analysis, this would be
partially offset by the need to increase the flow of new teachers into the
system and thus the increased proportion of novice teachers, so the net increase in student test score gains would be 1.2 percentile points per year.
In our context, the potential benefits of a system in which new
teachers initially work as contract teachers are far greater, for two reasons. First, the negative novice teacher effect is counteracted by a positive contract teacher effect, as seen in Section 4. Second, the gap in
teacher effectiveness appears larger — the gap we observe in our data
between the students of the roughly 50% of contract teachers that
were hired into the TSC and the students of those not hired is 0.32 standard deviations, even though performance was not the only criterion
used by TSC when hiring.28
To get a sense of how big the total effect might be, suppose teachers
work for 27 years.29 If new entrants to the profession worked three
years as a contract teacher and half were subsequently hired as civil
service teachers, then 20% of the teaching force would be made up of contract teachers in steady state. The proportion of novices in the system
would double from 1 in 30 to 2 in 30, bringing down average scores by
0.065/30 or 0.0022 standard deviations. Assuming that students of experienced contract teachers score 0.275 standard deviations more than students of their civil-service teacher counterparts (the average of
coefficients b2 and b4 in Table 2), this effect would boost average test
scores by 0.275 × 0.2 − 0.0022 = 0.052 standard deviations among students taught by contract teachers. (Note that this includes the impact of
any class size reduction due to the additional contract teachers.) The
teacher workforce made up of civil service teachers would have scored,
while on contract, 0.32 standard deviations more than their counterparts
who were not hired into the civil service. If we assume that only half of
this effect persists once they become civil-service teachers,30 and since
80% of teachers would be TSC teachers, the gain in test scores among students overall from improved quality of the TSC workforce is 0.16 × 0.8 =
0.13 standard deviations. Overall, the gain would thus be approximately
0.052 + 0.13 = 0.182 standard deviations.
The analysis above assumes that the entire gain in student performance documented in Section 4 for contract teachers is due to their
exerting higher effort in response to stronger incentives and therefore
does not persist once they become civil servants. However, it could also
reflect a positive selection among those initially hired as contract teachers
compared to civil servants, which would mean that some of the effect
would persist, in which case our 0.182 standard deviation estimate
above should be interpreted as a lower bound. To obtain an upper
bound of the possible effect, if the entire test score gain in Section 4
were due to selection rather than incentives, then in steady state rather
than only roughly 20% of the teaching workforce generating the test
score gain we observe among students of contract teachers, 100%
would, increasing the estimated effect by an additional 0.22 standard deviations, for a total gain of approximately 0.4 standard deviation.31
Of course we cannot measure all potential channels of dynamic impact. Incentives to become a teacher could potentially either increase or
decrease under a system in which teachers initially were hired on a contract basis by local PTAs. As discussed earlier, under the current system,
civil-service teacher wages are held far above market clearing levels by
the politically powerful teacher union. This motivates many to train as
teachers. Jobs are rationed by queuing, so those entering teacher training college currently can expect several years of unemployment before
getting a TSC position. Replacing a period of unemployment with a period of contract teaching at low wages could potentially increase the net
present value of becoming a teacher. On the other hand, entering teacher
training college will be less attractive to the extent prospective teacher
training students fear that they will perform badly as contract teachers
and therefore will not eventually obtain civil-service positions.32
It is also possible that there is complementarity or substitutability
between teacher value added and the incentive system, so the gap in
performance between teachers under civil-service contracts could be
either smaller or larger than under short-term contracts.
28 This estimate was obtained through an OLS regression run on the subset of students
assigned to the ETP contact teacher. We regress students' endline scores on a dummy
equal to 1 if the contract teacher was hired by TSC within 2 years of the program start, controlling for the student and school level controls of Table A2. The coefficient is 0.32 and the
standard error is 0.11.
29 The standard retirement age for civil servants in Kenya is 55 and contract teachers in
our sample are 27 years old on average; what's more firing is quasi-inexistent, and voluntary quits among teachers in Kenya are very rare.
30 The literature on the inter-temporal stability of teacher effectiveness is mostly based
on US data. Raw correlations are around 0.3–0.4, adjusted correlation are higher, at 0.6–
0.7. See McCaffrey et al. (2009) and Goldhaber and Hansen (2013). Using multiple years
of data to reduce the noise coming from variation in students, McCaffrey et al. (2009) estimate within-teacher correlation in value added ranging from 0.5 in elementary grades to
0.8 in middle grades.
31 Another reason this figure should be considered an upper bound is that it is based on
comparing contract teachers to civil-service teachers who teach the lower grades and thus
may not be representative of civil-service teachers as a whole.
32 While in general equilibrium if programs to fund PTAs to hire locally on temporary
contracts were expanded to cover all of the schools in the area, the pool of potential contract teachers would be somewhat reduced, this effect is likely small, as two thirds of
schools in the area were provided funds to hire contract teachers either through this program and contract teachers in the program were drawn from the local area.

Students identified as dropouts are coded as absent. Those reported to have moved to another school are excluded from the analysis. Columns 2–8: OLS regressions. The endline test was administered
after the program had been in place for five school terms. In each school, 60 students were randomly drawn from the baseline sample to participate in the tests. Scores are normalized such
that the mean and standard deviation of the comparison group are zero and one, respectively. Columns 6–8 reweigh the observations by the inverse of the non-attrition rate in their quintile of the initial performance distribution.
In both panels the omitted category is the comparison group. Panel A: “basic ETP” is a dummy equal to 1 if the school was sampled for the basic ETP program. The coefficient on this dummy
provides the average effect of the basic ETP program on students. “ETP + SBM” is a dummy equal to 1 if the school was sampled for the ETP program with the SBM training. Panel B: “basic
ETP, assigned to TSC teacher” is a dummy equal to 1 if the school was sampled for the basic ETP program and the student was assigned to the TSC teacher. The coefficient on this dummy
provides the average effect of the basic ETP program on students assigned to TSC teachers.
All regressions control for region dummies. Robust standard errors are clustered at the school level and shown in parentheses. ***, **, * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels
respectively. Columns 2–8: There are only 139 schools/clusters because tests could not be administered in one of the ETP schools.

Notes: bounds à la Lee (2009) obtained by trimming upper or lower tail in treatment group (see text for details). Baseline covariates (gender and age below median) are used to narrow the
bounds, as explained in Lee (2009). These estimated upper and lower bound estimates do not control for the date of the test. Bootstrapped standard errors clustered at the school level in
parentheses (1000 replications). Standard errors are calculated following Lee (2009), that is, to take into account the trimmed estimate. Scores are normalized such that the mean and
standard deviation of the comparison group are zero and one, respectively. ***, **, * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels respectively. There are only 139 schools/clusters because tests could not be administered in one of the ETP schools.
т: the trimming proportion corresponds to the proportion of trimmed observations in the treatment group (or the group with less attrition for rows e and f).

Notes: OLS regressions. The omitted category is the comparison group. The long-run test was administered one year after the 18-month long program had ended. Scores are normalized
such that the mean and standard deviation of the comparison group are zero and one, respectively.
“Basic ETP” is a dummy equal to 1 if the school was sampled for the basic ETP program. The coefficient on this dummy provides the average effect of the basic ETP program on students.
“ETP + SBM” is a dummy equal to 1 if the school was sampled for the ETP program with the SBM training. “Basic ETP, assigned to TSC teacher” is a dummy equal to 1 if the school was
sampled for the basic ETP program and the student was assigned to the TSC teacher. The coefficient on this dummy provides the average effect of the basic ETP program on students
assigned to TSC teachers.
Robust standard errors clustered at the school level in parentheses. ***, **, * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels respectively. There are only 139 schools/clusters because tests
could not be administered in one of the ETP schools.
